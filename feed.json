This shows that we often do not appreciate how important it is to take a moment to pause and reflect.</p>\n<p>The idea of &ldquo;niksen,&rdquo; a Dutch word that means consciously doing nothing, fits well with these findings. Doing nothing can be seen as a way to give our minds a break, so we can relax and let our thoughts wander without distractions from the outside world. This is different from the modern habit of always being busy and seeking distractions, such as constantly checking internet news. By doing nothing, we can improve our mental health, as it gives us the opportunity to organize our thoughts and become more creative.</p>\n<p>We often underestimate how valuable doing nothing can be, because we do not realize how interesting and enjoyable our own thoughts can be. People usually choose activities to keep busy, often because they are afraid of getting bored. But doing nothing can be surprisingly enriching, as shown by the positive responses of people in studies. If we learn to appreciate moments of rest more, we can learn to enjoy simply thinking and reflecting.

This shows that we often do not appreciate how important it is to take a moment to pause and reflect.\n\nThe idea of \"niksen,\" a Dutch word that means consciously doing nothing, fits well with these findings. Doing nothing can be seen as a way to give our minds a break, so we can relax and let our thoughts wander without distractions from the outside world. This is different from the modern habit of always being busy and seeking distractions, such as constantly checking internet news. By doing nothing, we can improve our mental health, as it gives us the opportunity to organize our thoughts and become more creative.\n\nWe often underestimate how valuable doing nothing can be, because we do not realize how interesting and enjoyable our own thoughts can be. People usually choose activities to keep busy, often because they are afraid of getting bored. But doing nothing can be surprisingly enriching, as shown by the positive responses of people in studies. If we learn to appreciate moments of rest more, we can learn to enjoy simply thinking and reflecting. This can ultimately contribute to a more balanced and satisfying life.\n\n\n## Related:\n\n* [Scatterfocus](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/give-your-mind.html)\n",

However, I often run into problems because my skills and knowledge don’t match the level I want to achieve. When I want to fix or improve something, I have a vision of the outcome, but I’m not technically skilled enough to reach that outcome. It’s a matter of practice, but since our house is generally in good shape, there aren’t many opportunities to practice.

After all, how often in your life do you replace a shower or work on plumbing? Maybe once or twice, three times at most. It’s not a good investment of my time.</p>\n<p>There are, however, some things I can do. Recently, I replaced a light switch. It was a simple task, or so I thought.

This means there&rsquo;s very little input from others, allowing me to focus solely on what I believe is most important. Without the need to consider others' schedules or demands, I can prioritize my tasks and work at my own pace. This autonomy is a significant factor in why I find August so productive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-downside-of-no-deadlines\">The Downside of No Deadlines</h2>\n<p>However, the lack of deadlines can be a double-edged sword. Without the pressure of time constraints, I sometimes fall into Parkinson&rsquo;s Law, where work expands to fill the time available.

It&rsquo;s a delicate balance to maintain, but being aware of this tendency helps me stay on track.</p>\n<h2 id=\"battling-the-summer-heat\">Battling the Summer Heat</h2>\n<p>Another challenge of working in August is the intense summer heat. With temperatures often soaring to 40 degrees Celsius, it can be tough to stay motivated and efficient. The heat slows me down, affects my sleep, and generally makes it harder to maintain a high level of productivity. To combat this, I adjust my schedule to work during the cooler parts of the day, like early mornings, and take it easier in the afternoons when the heat is at its peak.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-right-balance\">Finding the Right Balance</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s all about finding the right balance. On one hand, I enjoy fewer interruptions and less pressure, which allows me to work comfortably. On the other hand, I have to contend with the slower pace brought on by the summer heat. Recognizing the different rhythms of the year is crucial. Summer might be slower, but winter tends to be more intense. Adapting to these seasonal changes and adjusting my work habits accordingly helps me optimize my productivity throughout the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optimizing-productivity\">Optimizing Productivity</h2>\n<p>To make the most of August, I focus on my peak concentration times, which for me is mid-morning.

Research shows that when meetings start late, this leads to lower satisfaction with the outcomes of the meeting. Participants not only have a negative attitude towards the meeting itself, but also towards the results that come out of it.

These improvements are much more convincing than, for example, the benefits of shorter meetings.\n\nData shows that people with insomnia and insufficient sleep perform much worse at work and work less safely. They also use sleep medication more often, while others more frequently opt for non-medication treatments. Due to fatigue, employees lose an average of $1967 per year in productivity. This shows how costly sleep deprivation can be for both employees and employers.\n\nThe importance of good sleep cannot be emphasized enough. Sleeping in is seen as a major gain because it not only improves your performance and well-being but also has economic benefits. Employees who get enough and good sleep can do their work better and faster. This leads to higher productivity and ultimately more income.\n\n## Related:\n* [Well-rested people are more positive](https://jeroensangers.com/2024/01/24/positive-sleep.html)\n",

				"content_text": "When you have less energy, it can change your way of thinking and promote creativity. You are less likely to stick to usual thought patterns and more open to unexpected ideas. Research shows that people are often better at solving problems when they are less alert, such as at times of the day when they don't feel at their best.\n\nBeing creative means being able to make connections between things that seem unrelated at first glance. This is easier when you are less focused, as your mind can wander more freely and form new ideas. Sometimes it helps to let a problem rest for a while, so the solution emerges on its own. When you have less energy, you are less inclined to focus on direct, logical solutions and can instead make room for innovative ideas.\n\nIt may seem strange to do creative tasks when you don't feel energetic, but that's when surprising and original ideas can arise.

It’s often predicated on the idea that you should be focused on doing one thing, and one thing only, very efficiently: time is money, etc. etc. But that itself, sometimes referred to as a “monochronic” understanding of time, is no more or less “natural” than other ways of conceiving of time, like “polychronic” culture, which understands time as dynamic, flexible, and filled with several tasks at once, each of which will take the time that they need. Monochronic cultures may be more “efficient” in their use of time, but in their treatment of time as a commodity, they lose the richness that comes with allowing tasks, conversations, and interactions to move forward at a more natural and sustainable pace.\n<footer>Anne Helen Petersen<cite> <a href=\"https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-diminishing-returns-of-calendar\">https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-diminishing-returns-of-calendar</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote><script note=\"\" src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nMy quest for the rest of this year: get better at living a “polychronic” life.\n",

We tend not to prioritize them. We tend to think that to get together there has to be a reason involved. We have to have an event or some purpose to it. A run or a round of golf. Making a batch of beer or building a deck. Or we need to get the families together, let our partners talk and kids play. Dinner or a barbecue. Often, we guys never seem to think of getting together “just because”. For no reason at all other than to connect. Have a chit chat about anything under the sun. Or, sit in silence together and just be.\n<footer>Patrick Rhone<cite> <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/thinking-about-friendships/\">https://www.patrickrhone.net/thinking-about-friendships/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote><script note=\"\" src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Videoconferences require participants to focus their attention on a small part of the screen. This limits their thinking processes, which can lead to less creativity and fewer new ideas. Research shows that videoconferences make it harder to come up with new ideas because people have to concentrate on the screen, which narrows their thinking ability.</p>\n<p>The body&rsquo;s response to the visual field plays a role in this. When people are relaxed, their pupils become smaller so they can see everything around them. But in stressful or exciting situations, the pupils become larger and they see less of their surroundings.

When people are relaxed, their pupils become smaller so they can see everything around them. But in stressful or exciting situations, the pupils become larger and they see less of their surroundings.

				"content_text": "It is good to spend some time planning your day, tidying up your inbox, and setting goals. This helps you clearly see what you need to do and how to approach it. But be careful not to lose too much time on these preparations. Overplanning can lead to procrastination and spending more time thinking than doing.\n\nFinding the right balance between planning and doing is important for your productivity. It can be tempting to plan everything in detail, but often it's better to quickly make a list of your most important tasks and start right away. You usually already know what is important to you; it's about writing down these priorities and then taking action.

While he composed his message, he complained that the order of the keys on the keyboard made no sense to him.</p>\n<p>Of course, he never learned to type and never used a computer. “Why don&rsquo;t they put the letters in alphabetical order?”\nI guess he is right. The QWERTY layout makes sense when you type with all fingers, but probably is not the most efficient layout on small screens.</p>\n<p>Immediately a thought came up in my head: ”There&rsquo;s an app for that“. And yes, you can install <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/es/app/abcdef-keyboard/id1465367757?l=en\">an alternative keyboard</a> with all letters in alphabetical order for only 0,99€.</p>\n<p>To save my father the hassle of purchasing an app, I thought it would be best is I gifted the app. I initiated the process, but quickly ran into a wall, since Apple does not allow me to gift app from my Spanish Apple account to a Dutch Apple account. It surprised me, since we live in a global world…</p>\n<p>Up to plan B. I asked my father for his phone and proceeded to purchase the keyboard app. Of course, my father never purchased any app, so I had to set up a payment method for his account. Apple offers several options here:</p>\n<p>First there is the credit card/debit card. My father does not have a credit card, but does have a credit card. However, his card number is alphanumerical and the interface only allowed me to enter numbers. So I tried my credit card, but again, Apple won&rsquo;t allow a Spanish credit card be used for a Dutch account.</p>\n<p>Then there was the option to use PayPal, which obviously my father hasn&rsquo;t got either.</p>\n<p>Next in the list was the option to pay be telephone on selected carriers (of course, no mention of which those selected carriers are). I entered my father&rsquo;s phone number and pressed OK, but nothing happened. I assume that my father&rsquo;s carrier is not one of the selected carriers, but there was no error message at all.</p>\n<p>Finally on the list was iDeal, a protocol developed by the Dutch banks specially for online purchases. My father&rsquo;s bank account does support iDeal, but he has never activated it. But my mother did, so the next plan is to have her purchase the app and then install it through family sharing.</p>\n<p>I took my mother&rsquo;s phone, and tried to purchase the app, but got an error message telling me that I did not have enough balance on the Apple account. What?</p>\n<p>After looking around a little bit, I found out that Apple had not implemented iDeal as a payment method, as most online stores do, but rather as a method to top up the balance on the Apple Account.</p>\n<p>So I proceeded to use iDeal to get money on my mother&rsquo;s account. I transferred the minimum amount (1€), got passed to the banking app, accepted the transaction and got sent back to the App Store, which gave me an erro message. I tried it once more, with the same result. I checked the bank status and effectively saw that I had paid two times an euro to Apple.</p>\n<p>5 Minutes later the balance of my mother&rsquo;s account updated and I could finally purchase the keyboard app.</p>\n<p>Now I just have to install it on my father&rsquo;s phone. They have family sharing activated, but I could not see my mother&rsquo;s purchases from my father&rsquo;s phone. For that, I had to activate App sharing in the family sharing settings. And when I did that, I got an error message. In order to activate app sharing, you&rsquo;ll need a valid payment method…</p>\n<p>I tried, and I tried and even though my mother has Apple Pay, iDeal and a positive balance on het Apple account, according to Apple she has no payment method configured, so there is no way to transfer her purchases to my father&rsquo;s phone.</p>\n<p>What seemed a good idea, spend 0,99€ to gift an app to my father, ended up wasting almost an hour of time without being able to purchase the app.</p>\n<p>This should not be so difficult Apple!</p>\n<p>In the end, I spent another hour to teach my father how to send voice messages s he doesn&rsquo;t have to search for the keys on the keyboard.</p>\n",

My father's bank account does support iDeal, but he has never activated it. But my mother did, so the next plan is to have her purchase the app and then install it through family sharing.\r\n\r\nI took my mother's phone, and tried to purchase the app, but got an error message telling me that I did not have enough balance on the Apple account. What?\r\n\r\nAfter looking around a little bit, I found out that Apple had not implemented iDeal as a payment method, as most online stores do, but rather as a method to top up the balance on the Apple Account.\r\n\r\nSo I proceeded to use iDeal to get money on my mother's account. I transferred the minimum amount (1€), got passed to the banking app, accepted the transaction and got sent back to the App Store, which gave me an erro message. I tried it once more, with the same result. I checked the bank status and effectively saw that I had paid two times an euro to Apple.\r\n\r\n5 Minutes later the balance of my mother's account updated and I could finally purchase the keyboard app.\r\n\r\nNow I just have to install it on my father's phone. They have family sharing activated, but I could not see my mother's purchases from my father's phone. For that, I had to activate App sharing in the family sharing settings. And when I did that, I got an error message. In order to activate app sharing, you'll need a valid payment method…\r\n\r\nI tried, and I tried and even though my mother has Apple Pay, iDeal and a positive balance on het Apple account, according to Apple she has no payment method configured, so there is no way to transfer her purchases to my father's phone.\r\n\r\nWhat seemed a good idea, spend 0,99€ to gift an app to my father, ended up wasting almost an hour of time without being able to purchase the app.\r\n\r\nThis should not be so difficult Apple!\r\n\r\nIn the end, I spent another hour to teach my father how to send voice messages s he doesn't have to search for the keys on the keyboard.\n",

By valuing these moments, we can improve our reading and move from superficial information processing to building valuable knowledge.\n\n## Related:\n* [Rephrasing a text helps me to better understand what the author means](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/rewording-a-text.html)\n* [A Zettelkasten is an intelligent conversation with my past thoughts](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/a-zettelkasten-is.html)\n* [When helping someone, give that person enough information and boost their confidence by showing how that information can help others](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/when-helping-someone.html)\n* [Keep essential information in your mind so you can access it quickly without having to look it up](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/04/06/keep-essential-information.html)\n* [Fleeting notes](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/08/when-reading-capture.html)\n* [Think](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/17/think.html)\n* [Eufriction](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/07/29/eufriction.html)\n",

This increases the likelihood of achieving your personal and professional goals.\n\n## Related:\n* [Before you start (a task, a work session, a project…), set a time budget](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/10/20/be-fore-you.html)\n* [Do not set SMART goals](https://jeroensangers.com/2024/02/28/do-not-set.html)\n* [Frog eating](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/07/skip-the-easy.html)\n* [Environment](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/06/environment.html)\n* [Motivation](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/30/convince-yourself-that.html)\n* [Less mobile](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/10/reduce-mobile-phone.html)\n* [Attention residue](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/07/25/a-little-bit.html)\n* [Habit](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/10/20/habit.html)\n",

This should not be the gold standard for intelligence, as it is an idiosyncratic organ that evolved for circumstances other than those we find ourselves in.\r\n<footer>Donal Clarc<cite> <a href=\"http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2020/09/lets-move-on-from-unintelligible.html\">http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2020/09/lets-move-on-from-unintelligible.html</a></cite></footer>\r\n</blockquote><script src=“https://micro.blog/quoteback.js”></script>\n",

Beaudoin\" cite=\"https://pdfpen.com/pdfpen/entry/productivity-experts-interview-with-luc-p-beaudoin/\">\nInfluencers make us feel that productivity is important, and yet they rarely define the term, let alone helpfully. For example, David Allen’s Getting Things Done (GTD) book, which became very popular in software circles, uses the term productivity very loosely. Many of the core examples in the GTD method relate to general activities such as cleaning one’s garage as opposed to working with knowledge. And the GTD principles have no reference to cognitive science, even though cognitive science is the modern interdisciplinary science of understanding the information processing we do in our brains, with or without the aid of technology.\n<footer>Luc P.

As Tom said: feeds express a personal relation.\n\nI unsubscribed from most business and group blogs, with a few exceptions for some blogs run by two or three people I know well.\n\nThen I dedicated several hours to reorganise the 242 remaining feeds into social distance based folders:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>My Publications</strong>: this folder actually has number 0, but in HTML it is complicated to create numbered lists not starting at 1 and being strictly sequential.</li>\n    <li><strong>Close Contacts</strong>: People I know well and with whom I have a relation spanning several years.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dunbar's Tribe</strong>: feeds from people I know in real life, through digital exchanges or by having followed them for over a decade (as long as they also publish some personal information).</li>\n    <li><strong>Outer circle</strong>: interesting writing by people I don't know at all.</li>\n    <li><strong>The Fire Hose</strong>: some feeds by businesses. I assigned number 99 to this folder to indicate the correct social distance.</li>\n</ol>\n\nWhile reviewing all those feeds I also made sure they are all configured to use the ‘https’ protocol, that they use the current domain name (some blogs moved from using the platform's subdomain to having their own domain) and to use a current feed address.\n\nSpeaking of the latter, it surprised me to see that several blogs, including some high volume sites, still channel their feeds through <a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feedburner</a>.\n\nSo there we are, all feeds organised and read.

In other words, using litmus paper to test the pH degree of a drop of liquid has a huge error margin.</p>\n<p>I have this principle in mind with most things I measure. The inclusion of a piece of JavaScript on the pages of my web site in order to have Google Analytics collect data about my visitors has an effect on the user experience: the page loads a little bit slower.

The most common method of doing this is by using an intermediate server, the &lsquo;URL shortener&rsquo;, which registers each visit to the destination site.</p>\n<p>In the first years of Twitter, URL shorteners such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit.ly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were necessary to prevent long URLs from using too many of the available 140 characters in a tweet. However, in 2011Twitter implemented their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own URL shortener<!-- raw HTML omitted --> inside their service so that each URL, including the ones passed through another shortener, only use 20 characters. Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>\n<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet. Once again, this was true in the past, but nowadays Twitter gives <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excellent statistics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the number of favourites, retweets and answers to each tweet on their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->statistics page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference between Twitter&rsquo;s own shortener and external services is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transparency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you&rsquo;re linking to if you don&rsquo;t use an external shortener &ndash; and therefore just Twitter&rsquo;s service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>\n<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Single Point of Failure<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>\n<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expectation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was that tweets with shortened links get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clicked less<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit.ly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>\n<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service, which was invoked by adding the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>\n<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chi-squared<!-- raw HTML omitted --> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>\n<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <!-- raw HTML omitted -->calculate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more successful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (p = 0.0439).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not have any benefits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for me and it even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reduces clicks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>\n",

When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you're linking to if you don't use an external shortener -- and therefore just Twitter's service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.\n\nOn a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <strong>Single Point of Failure</strong> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener's service in order to get the actual address of the page you're linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.\n\nSince tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <em>expectation</em> was that tweets with shortened links get <strong>clicked less</strong> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.\n\n<h2>Experimenting</h2>\n\nFor conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code>\n\nI prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href=\"http://bitly.com/\">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.\n\nI decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <a href=\"http://tweko.com\">Tweko</a> service, which was invoked by adding the <code>#tweko</code> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.\n\nOf course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment -- the tweet with the shortened URL -- a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.\n\n<h3>Tweet 1 -- Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\">Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/2iZFFblXsn\">http://bit.ly/1c8gCuw</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/371931328067153920\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Tweet 2 -- No Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\"><p>Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/ekVvviOOni\">http://canasto.es/2010/03/como-g...</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/372006931189481472\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The results</h2>\n\n<p>After a few weeks I decided to have a look at the statistics in Google Analytics. I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named 'TestShortener' to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field 'ad content' as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th>Visits</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <tfoot>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total</td>\n      <td>820</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tfoot>\n</table>\n\nClearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample's success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.\n\nIn order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href=\"http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95\">calculate</a>:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th># successes</th>\n      <th># trials</th>\n      <th>Confidence interval</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe verdict is that the 'NoShortener' sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).\n\n<h2>My conclusion</h2>\n\nFor me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.\n",

The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup verification codes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky &lsquo;finder&rsquo; the possibility to get into your Google account <!-- raw HTML omitted -->without<!-- raw HTML omitted --> needing the SMS confirmation.</p>\n<p>I immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that &ndash;with the current roaming rates in Europe&ndash; they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Satisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for iPhone, FlipBook, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for iPad, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Earth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>After a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account.

				"content_text": "Google has released a new security measure to help you protect your ever increasing amount of data stored on their servers. This <a href=\"https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsAuthConfig\">2-step authentication</a> means that when you log in to your Google account with your username and password, you will receive a code by SMS message. Only after entering this code you will be able to get to your data.\n\nEven though I don't have a lot of data on Google's servers (I hardly ever use Gmail or Google Docs, mainly just <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/\">Google Reader</a>) I thought that it was a good idea to activate this service -- better safe than sorry, right?\n\n<h3>Activating 2-step verification</h3>\n\nSo I went ahead and activated the service. The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <em>backup verification codes</em>. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky 'finder' the possibility to get into your Google account <strong>without</strong> needing the SMS confirmation.\n\nI immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that --with the current roaming rates in Europe-- they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!\n\n<h3>External applications</h3>\n\nSatisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Some mobile or desktop applications that work outside of a browser aren't yet compatible with 2-step verification. These applications are hard-coded to ask for a username and password, and do not prompt for a verification code. If you want one of these applications to access your Google Account, you must enter an application-specific password, not your Google Account password, when asked for a password.\n</blockquote>\n\nI went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> for iPhone, FlipBook, <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> for iPad, <a href=\"http://www.feedly.com/\">Feedly</a>, <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.\n\n<h3>Does it make sense?</h3>\n\nAfter a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.\n\nI know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google's servers. To me it makes no sense that --even though one application increased its security-- the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.\n\nI finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can't use Google anymore as my <a href=\"http://smarterware.org/6286/how-to-set-up-openid-on-your-own-domain\">OpenID provider</a>, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web --those that require registration-- I want to comment on.

And yes, on November 14 I will take the airplane to Sevilla to be present at this event.</p>\n<p>When the event was first announced I doubted whether I should participate due to the high costs (plane ticket and accommodation; the EBE itself is free) and decided not to go.</p>\n<p>What made me change my mind? Well, part of the program is the election of the best Spanish blogs, and my blog <a href=\"http://canasto.es/\">El Canasto</a> makes a very good chance of being elected as the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong>! In the last partial rankings I held the first position, while previously I was number two.</p>\n<p>Of course, the EBE is also a great place to meet some people in real life, people I have been working with for quite some time. I am also looking forward to meeting tons of new people, making new connections and new plans…</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to participate at the Evento Blog España.</p>\n",

But now that I start writing I realise that I am by far the right person for writing on this topic. Right now I am sitting in my own house behind my €1400 Macbook with a high speed broadband internet connection. What am I supposed to know about poverty? I (and all my readers as well) probably belong to the richest 1% of the world.</p>\n<p>For me poverty is something they show on TV. Only once in a while I see poor people begging for money on the street, and I know that I can ignore them because I happen to live in a country with excellent social services that will take care of these people. For my own conscience, I make my contributions to some NGO's to pay of my guilt debt. When I read back these lines, it sounds very cold, which is not how I am, but there is a great deal of truth in it.</p>\n<p>Only twice in my life I actually saw poverty with my own eyes, when I visited Lesotho and Thailand, and it greatly affected me. More than that, it made me realise how lucky I am. We dedicate about 2% of our income to charity, which is an amount we won't even miss, but which makes a great difference for the people depending on it.</p>\n<p>I encourage everybody reading this to do the same: realise how lucky and incredibly rich you are, and donate 1-2% of your income. Together we can stop poverty.</p>\n",

This very much surprised me, as I was used to Carbonite running as a service and being able to backup files from all users. I assumed that Mozy would not work the same, but that I could configure the files to backup on a per user basis. I couldn't find how to do so... I checked the FAQs on the Mozy site, but most of the texts have been written for Windows users.</p>\n<p>And today I received an e-mail from Mozy explaining me how to get started with Mozy… on Windows.</p>\n<p>I am not sure what to do with the software.

I also choose English as my preferred language for everything related with IT, as more software and documentation is available in English, and because of the horrible translations in the first Dutch operating systems.</p>\n<p>When I moved to Spain, I only knew a little bit of Spanish, so I decided to dive into it, and convert my whole life to Spanish. I wrote my own personal notes in Spanish, my PCs had the Spanish version of Windows, my to-do lists and calendar were in Spanish, and little by little my Spanish improved.</p>\n<p>Now that I have lived here for a little bit more than six years, doing everything in Spanish started to feel a little bit forced. A few months back I changed the language of my mobile phone to English, and suddenly I realized that it is indeed possible to fit the texts on the tiny screen. My phone instantly became easier to use.</p>\n<p>Then I got a new laptop. Though initially and by habit installed in Spanish, I felt more at home when I changed it into English (fortunately, in Mac OS X the operating system language is a user preference, so I didn't need to reinstall). And since the tools I worked with are in English, I also enter the data (to-do items, appointments, etc.) in English.</p>\n<p>For each aspect of my life, I choose whether it is best to do in Dutch, English or Spanish. For example, whenever I am writing on El Canasto, I prefer that everything is in Spanish in order not to lose any time translating. Therefore, my brainstorming, saved text fragments and Movable Type are in Spanish. I also found that even though I am fully trilingual, you can't beat 37 years of experience in a language. Deeper thinking and difficult tasks are thus easier to do in Dutch.</p>\n<p>You see: each language has its place.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

For the last two months I have been following the <a href=\"http://teachingsells.com/?ref=ebdbbfb9&amp;pid=c4a0577c\"><strong>Teaching Sells</strong></a> course, and I am very enthusiastic about it.\n\nThe course is divided into five parts: Instructional design, marketing, creating multi-media content, business models and building membership sites. The more technical parts are not that interesting for me (just some links to the software used is enough for me), but the other three courses are well worth the money. Furthermore, the forums already brought some very good contacts, and I might be setting up some joint-ventures to start building membership sites.\n\nMy first ILE project will probably be a Spanish productivity course (what else?), on which I will start working in a few months (of course I am already doing some brainstorming now…)\n",

This year's topic is the environment.</em></p>\n<p>Camping is my favourite holiday activity. In our tent I feel free and I feel at home as I use my own stuff and sleep in my own sack. Furthermore, it is very easy for a shy person like me to have contact with others on a camping. I feel a lot more comfortable on a camping than in hotel and apartments.</p>\n<p>However, lately I noticed a trend of people camping more and more luxury: huge caravans with satellite television, microwave ovens, washing machine, skottelbraai, and even a motor to move around on the camping. While I like some comfort, one of the things I like about camping is its simpleness: less things around you means less cleaning and less worrying and thus more relaxing. And it still is possible:</p>\n<p>When I still lived in the Netherlands, I was a member of the <a href=\"http://kampeerclub.nl/\">NTKC</a>, a club of people who love camping in a simple and quiet way. The NTKC owns 22 campings in natural areas, and all the maintenance and administration is done by club members. On the NTKC terrains, people camp with tents up to 1.90 meters high and always in natural colours. When staying for a longer period, members move their tent to prevent dead grass.</p>\n<p>Most of the time there is plenty of room on the campings; in spring and autumn it might happen that you won't see anybody else from your tent!</p>\n<p>For me, being in the middle of nature is a very relaxing experience. If you live in the Netherlands and enjoy camping and nature, be sure to check out the NTKC. There are similar organisations elsewhere, such as the <a href=\"http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/\">Camping and Caravanning&nbsp; Club</a> in the U.K..</p>\n",

Some days ago I looked at some teenagers and noticed that all of them were listening to a MP3 player, but none of them had an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPod-Nano-Video-Silver%2Fdp%2FB000JO7PIM&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\">iPod</a>.</p>\n<p>As the iPod is certainly the hippest and easiest to use MP3 player on the market, I assumed that at least some teenagers would have one, while others would settle for a cheaper model. The iPods is indeed more expensive than other players, but usually pricing is not that big problem for teenagers if the device is cool enough.</p>\n<p>I decided to ask a teacher who also owns an iPod about his view on the subject, and he gave me a very simple explanation.</p>\n<p><strong>The iPod is anti-social</strong>.</p>\n<p>For teenagers, gadgets only have one function: communicating and sharing with friends. The first thing they do after downloading a song from internet is share it with their friends. And well, the iPod simply won't let them do that.</p>\n<p>Songs on the iPod are locked up and are only accessible from iTunes on the original PC. Furthermore, to connect an iPod to a PC you need a cable and there is no way a teenagers is going to walk around with an un-sexy USB cable.</p>\n<p>A for teenagers successful MP3 player has an incorporated USB port (usually hidden under a cap) so they can connect it easily to any PC (at school, at their friend's home,...) and it should simply work like a memory stick with the MP3 files accessible from the operating system for easy copying of files.</p>\n<p>As you know, I am not a very social person, and therefore I am perfectly happy without an iPod.</p>\n",

Many people I speak to have only one dream: becoming a civil servant. Unlike most other modern countries, in Spain civil servants earn way more that people working in companies. Add to that some very good secondary labour conditions and a <strong>contract for life</strong> without performance objectives, and you can understand why most people working for companies envy those others.</p>\n<p>Just an example: most teachers earn about 25% more than I do (and my wage is higher than the average company worker). For that money, they work 18–22 hours a week at the school, plus some hours at home for preparation and revision of exams, while I work 8,5 hours a day, five days a week. Furthermore, while I have four weeks of holidays, they get two whole months in summer, two weeks at christmas and another week at eastern!</p>\n<p>Other civil servants might not have such a long holidays as the teachers, but they do enjoy other benefits. Knowing all this, I am still surprised whenever I see the huge economical growth Spain is making with such a big and inefficient civil overhead.</p>\n",

As you see in the sidebar, I currently <del>maintain</del> have four weblogs.</p>\n<p>The oldest of the four is <a href=\"http://braintags.com/\">Brain Tags</a>, running since ages on Movable Type. Then I have a weblog called <b>The Wizard of POS</b>, until today running on the same MT installation as Brain Tags and available at ‘pos.braintags.com’. There is also an old blog about my web hosting adventures, which I haven't updated in ages, called <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/weblog\">Brytenet weblog</a> and just as the rest of the Brytenet site managed with eZ Publish. And finally I have my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href=\"http://canasto.es/\">El Canasto</a> maganed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Quite a mess, isn't it? Add to that the fact that I have been experimenting a lot with non-public weblogs, and you'll get an idea of what things look like.</p>\n<p>So I decided to clean things up, and do it well. You'll notice from the links in the side bar that I have presented my blogs as <strong>The Brain Network</strong>, a name I never have been satisfied with. Anyway, I acquired a new short and flashy domain name (of course hosted by <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">Brytenet</a>) and made a fresh MT4 installation. This will be the home of <strong>Brain Tags</strong>, <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, <strong>El Canasto</strong> and a new network blog (I still have to decide whether I want to continue with the Brytenet Weblog).</p>\n<p>Until now I have re-created <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, imported all existing entries, comments and trackbacks, and tweaked the default template. And by the way, I gave it its own domain name, <a href=\"http://pos-wizard.com/\">pos-wizard.com</a>.</p>\n<p>There is still a lot of work to be done (and I have little time), but I already feel good about the new <em>home</em> for my weblogs and am looking forward to being able to manage all my blogs from a single screen.</p>\n",

It did sort them, but did not recognise the date format used in some feeds, starting with the weekday (Mon – Sun). Therefore, my writings made on Wednesdays ended up at the end of the list;</li>\n<li>As there still are relatively few Pipes, it is easy to game the listing, which is sorted by the number of times a Pipe has been run. I simply clicked a few time on the <em>Run this Pipe</em> link, and little by little moved upwards in the list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Two minutes more clicking, and my <em>Brain Network</em> pipe ended up halfway on the second page, in front of some way more interesting feeds.

Robert Scoble published a good overview of the most important networks in <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/\">Competitors of PodTech that I love, er, going to the Content Mall</a>. A content mall is the same as a blogging network.</p>\n<p>As I am interested in blogging in general, I have been following various blogging networks for some time. I can clearly see the benefits of blogging networks for the bloggers involved, but have been wondering for a long time what the benefit is for the visitors of a site part of a blogging network. So I posted the following <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164130\">comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is clear that 'content malls' bring in huge benefits for the sites within a mall. They can work together and link to each other to boost PR.</p>\n<p>But what benefit is there for the visitors? Shopping malls bring benefit by sharing a physical space with various stores. After going shopping for clothes I can buy some electronics without having to drive to another place. Very comfortable.</p>\n<p>But when visiting a fashion weblog part of a content mall I can go to the technology weblog of that mall just as fast as I can go to any other techblog. I won't visit the technology weblog because it belongs to a certain group, but rather because I like it in spite of being part of that group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164224\">Answered</a> promptly by Robert self:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By joining a network a blogger/podcaster/videoblogger will probably be able to get paid much more than if he/she tries to do it on his/her own.</p>\n<p>That money might let them quit their jobs (that's what happened to <a href=\"http://GeekBrief.TV\">GeekBrief.TV</a>, for instance) which will enable that person to produce even more content for you.

Of course I have contacted Technorati about this issue, and will update this post when they reply.\n",

Though websites can be updated on a single place to fix the problem for once and ever, this is a lot harder for applications installed on millions of PC's.</p>\n<p>A few months ago we have found that some of our applications are incompattible with IE7, giving an ‘Invalid URL format’ error.

The <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/26/678149.aspx\">announcement </a> that Microsoft is going to push IE7 as an automatic update surely is going to give us some problems, as we are going to have to solve this bug and update all our customers before the end of Q3!</p>\n",

At both places I use a Windows XP desktop PC, equipped with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\">Firefox</a></strong> I use the Internet a lot, and have always have some tabs open with sites I want to read whenever I have a spare moment, e.g. when I am on hold. With Internet Explorer I would have my task bar cluttered with screens, but Firefox's tabs keep things organized.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.activewords.com/\">ActiveWords</a></strong> Whenever I have to work on a PC without ActiveWords I feel very clumsy. ActiveWords automatically corrects my typing errors, opens my applications, fills in texts and generally saves me a lot of time.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/\">Trillian</a></strong> With customers and friends all over the world I use instant messaging all the time. The problem is that everybody uses another application, and the different applications (MSN, ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Google Chat,…) do not talk together. Instead of installing a separate client for each protocol, I use Trillian, which 'speaks' all those protocols.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://skype.com/\">Skype</a></strong> Instead of sending messages, it is more efficient to actually talk to somebody. That is where Skype comes in, as I can talk with any other Skype user for free.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>In the office:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> We are a Microsoft shop, so obviously use Outlook. Most of my colleagues use it exclusively for e-mail, but I spend more time in the calendar and tasks. Of course I had to make some adjustments, as the Microsoft way of doing things does not always coincide with my own. So I installed <a href=\"http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/\">Outlook Quotefix</a> to stop Outlook from top-posting when I reply to messages and to trim the headers in my replies. Furthermore I use the <a href=\"http://gtdsupport.netcentrics.com/learn/\">Getting Things Done add-in</a> to streamline my workflow and the <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download&trk=ftr_ol\">LinkedIn toolbar</a> to create contacts directly from people's signatures and to keep them updated when contacts change their <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/sangers\">LinkedIn profile</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/desktopsearch/enterprise/default.mspx\">Windows Enterprise Desktop Search</a></strong> We have a lot of information scattered over a few places on several servers and of course on my own PC. Windows Desktop Search brings that all together, as I have it index all items in Outlook (mail, tasks, notes, contacts), and all documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML and PDF) on my PC and the servers. I use the enterprise edition as it has a much cleaner interface than the MSN edition.</li>\n<li><strong>ICG Software</strong> Of course we have our own applications installed. Not only for giving support, but also for invoicing and tracking customer activity (CRM).</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.unyte.net/\">Unyte</a></strong> Unyte is a free add-on for Skype that allows you to share an application on your PC with the person(s) on Skype. I use it to give demonstrations, training and support to our foreign customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>At home:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/\">Thunderbird</a></strong> My e-mail client of choice. It is fast and complete. Of course I use the IMAP protocol instead of POP3, so I always have all my important messages on the mail server to be accessed through webmail.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.palm.com/us/software/desktop/\">Palm Desktop</a></strong> At home I don't need an advanced planner, so this simple (and free!) calendar, task list and contact list fulfills all my needs.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/\">Ecto</a></strong> Blogging made easy. A real blogger does not write in small <code>textarea</code> fields, but uses a full blown desktop client.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.chami.com/html-kit/\">HTML-Kit</a></strong> I used to do my coding work in notepad, but noticed that I needed some more features. Since then I use HTML-Kit to do all my coding.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.rssbandit.org/\">RSS-Bandit</a></strong> To stay up-to-date with what is happening in the world I follow the writings on several web sites. Instead of visiting these sites every day, A read their feeds in RSS-Bandit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What web sites do you use every day?</h2>\n<p>Just in terms of raw weekly hours, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\">Google</a> is definitely number one. In addition to regular old searching, I use it for looking up definitions, as a calculator, and for checking stuff like maps and weather. I do love the Google.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I use <a href=\"http://getharvest.com/\">Harvest</a> to track my worked hours.</p>\n<p>All other sites enter in RSS-Bandit, which is my dashboard to the world. It shows me tech news, news about my friends, search results on topics I am interested in, comments made on my weblogs, replies to comments I have left on other blogs…</p>\n<h2>What PDA/personal organizer/system do you use to keep organized?</h2>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2004/07/palmone_zire_31/\">Palm Zire 31</a>, which I keep synchronized with my two workstations.

That whole safety thing you have to suffer through every time? He turned it into a comedy routine: “Please pretend to pay attention while we explain the safety features of this Boeing 737. I know, I can't believe it either, but there's a safety card in the seat pocket in front of you. No one ever reads it, so I'm not going to even bother asking you to. At this time, you should have your seatbelts on, your tray tables up, and your seats in their upright and most uncomfortable position. This is a no complaining, no whining, no smoking flight. If you absolutely must smoke, I suggest you avail yourself of our smoking area out on the wing...that is, if you can manage to get it lit. While you're out there, feel free to enjoy our inflight movie, Gone With The Wind. We don't expect a loss of cabin pressure today. If we did, the three of us would have called in sick. But if we do lose pressure, masks will automatically fall from the ceiling. After you're done screaming, simply put the mask on and breath normally, like this: [Darth Vader Imitation]. Please put your own mask on before helping your children...or those who are acting like children, such as your husband. Now, since we've been cleared for take-off, I'd like to ask you to lean over and please press your face against the window so that all those other bankrupt airlines can see that we have a full flight. Neener, neener! And thank you for flying Southwest today.

It automatically organizes entries tagged with <code>listing</code> on the Edgeio site, and allows visitors to search and comment on listings. The concept sounds very interesting to me, so I decided to try it out.</p>\n<p>The only thing I have for sale at the moment are web server accounts, so I created three posts on the <a href=\"http://blog.brytenet.com/\">BryteNet blog</a> describing the three web hosting packages <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">BryteNet</a> currently offers. I tagged all posts with the keyword <code>listing</code> as well as some additional keywords. After that I signed up at Edgeio, claimed my blog and noticed that the posts were already appearing on the site, including a thumbnail made from the image I used in the post. Though they offer the possibility to encode the list price in the blog post as well, I had not mentioned the price, so I edited my Edgeio entries to list the corresponding price. Conclusion: it is very easy to get listed on Edgeio.</p>\n<p>After that I went to the customer side of Edgeio, to see how my listings would appear. One great feature of Edgeio is that you can enter your location, and it will filter the listings based on the distance you have chosen with an AJAX slider. I started by putting the slider on 'Lleida' to see only listings from my home town. As expected, there are only a handful of bloggers here, only my own listings showed up.</p>\n<p>I moved the slider up to 'Catalonia'. To my surprise, I found that only one other Catalan blogger uses Edgeio, offering jobs in Barcelona. There are quite some bloggers in Catalonia, but apparently none of them has found Edgeio yet. I continued to 'Spain' finding three more offers, bringing the total on an amazing eight!</p>\n<p>It is clear that Edgeio is not ready for prime time yet. Though it is easy to get listed, not many bloggers use the service, and therefore it is not worth the effort at this moment to search for listings on Edgeio.</p>\n",

The old site had been created in a couple of minutes 'just to have something', and never changed afterwards. It was really time for a complete site overhaul. When planning the <a href=\"/2006/01/a_little_update/\">datacenter move</a>, I decided not to restore the old site, but to put a simple page with the main properties of the hosting packages and contact information instead. That gave me the chance to built the new site properly.</p>\n<h3>ClientExec</h3>\n<p>My first concern were the existing users of the server. I quickly installed <a href=\"http://www.clientexec.com/\">ClientExec</a> and created accounts for all users, so they can manage their helpdesk tickets and billing information. Installation was very easy, and within an hours I had everything set up. I still want to change the templates to fit in the new BryteNet style, but that can wait 'till later. I did modify the template to include the Google Analytics code. After all, I still want to know what is going on…</p>\n<h3>It's a Small Place</h3>\n<p>The next step was to restore the <a href=\"http://blog.brytenet.com/\">BryteNet weblog</a>. Since the new server has Fantastico installed, I only had to fill in some details, and WordPress was installed. I copied the plug-ins I used to the right place and restored the database to get the old content, and I was finished. 29 minutes was all I needed!</p>\n<h3>eZ Publish</h3>\n<p>For the rest of the site I had chosen the <a href=\"http://ez.no/\">eZ Publish</a> CMS. While eZ Publish is probably way too big for such a small site, I wanted to use it for its execllent multi-language support and since it can do literally anything. So I can manage all aspects of the site (product information, contact forms, customer forum,...) with a single tool. eZ Publish also has a weblog module, but for the moment I have chosen to stick with WordPress.<br>\nI had looked at eZ Publish before, and have big plans for it for future projects, but without a concrete implementation, it is difficult to find out what the possibilities and limitations of this CMS are.</p>\n<p>Installation was a breeze, and I have been able to activate the features I wanted to use at the moment. The templating system is very powerful, though I find it still difficult to find the right template when I want to change a part of a page-layout.</p>\n<p>A little disappointment was that eZ Publish is not able to generate friendly URI's when PHP is implemented as CGI rather than with mod_php. For security reasons PHP is run through CGI on the BryteNet servers, resulting in the appearance of <code>index.php?</code> in the middle of the URI. It is something I will have to live with…</p>\n<p>Another problem I still have to solve is that the automatically generated menus only contain folders, and I haven't found a way yet to include links outside eZ Publish in the menu. I have found something on the subject in the eZ forums, and will tackle this problem soon enough.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>The next big thing I am going to work on is to give BryteNet an unique face. At the moment the three components of the BryteNet site (eZ Publish, ClientExec and WorkPress) still use their default design, which I only modified a little bit. I om going to generate a completely new stylesheet for those sites, so they will have more or less the same look. I started my work with designing a new logo, and am now working on the colour scheme. I have some ideas on how the result will be, but am still experimenting with those ideas.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more news…</p>\n",

Fortunately, coming from another EU country I have the privilege to not really need it in daily life, so there was no problem. I can use my Dutch documentation for identify myself.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can't do is to buy expensive goods as a new car or a house. I had forgotten completely about these limitations, until we started <a href=\"/2005/06/car_hunting/\">looking for a new car</a> last summer. We did buy the car on MJ's name, but I decided to go for it again and hope that they would give me a longer lasting residence card. That was in August 2005:</p>\n<p><strong>August</strong><br>\nI started by obtaining the necessary papers and filling them in. I also tried to phone to the immigration office to get an appointment for delivering these papers. After two weeks, I got my appointment, which fortunately was after the business hours of my office.</p>\n<p><strong>September 8</strong><br>\nAfter leaving the office I went to the immigration office to deliver all papers I had prepared: a special form, copies of my passport, copies of my current, expired, residence card, copies of my last salary statement, an extract from my record in the town hall…</p>\n<p>Fortunately I had understood the cryptic instructions correctly, and all papers were in order. They told me that they were going to study my request, which was going to take them a full month!</p>\n<p><strong>November 9</strong><br>\nTime to find out whether they had approved my request. Unfortunately, this can't be done with an appointment, so you simply had to queue up at the immigration office. I told my boss that I was going to arrive late, and joined the queue two hours before the office was going to open. I only had about 20 people in front of me. I already knew from last time that I would have to spend the whole morning in the queue if I would not be there before they open their doors. After spending three hours on the street, and waiting 20 minutes more inside the office, I finally got a bunch of papers back; my request had been approved. I had to go to the bank to pay the administration costs and then to the police office to get my residence card. I payed directly, and decided to visit the police the next day, since the queue was too big already.</p>\n<p><strong>November 10</strong><br>\nI told my boss that I would arrive late again, and joined the queue 90 minutes before opening time; the queue at the police station is smaller. This time I only had 12 people in from of me. After waiting two hours on the street, I was allowed to enter to show the papers I received at the immigration office and place my signature and fingerprint on a special form so they can create my residence permit. They need one full month for doing this.</p>\n<p><strong>December 30</strong><br>\nBecause of the cold and the amount of work I had in December, I didn't go to pick up my residence permit until three weeks later. Once again I told my company that I would arrive late and once again I had to queue on the street, but this time only 45 minutes. Almost five months after filling in the forms I finally received a little card, which fortunately is valid until 2010.</p>\n<p>Renewing my residence permit has cost me €7, but most of all a lot of precious time. I spent about 6 hours waiting in queues on the street, 45 minutes in queues inside offices, and have been out of office during 3 hours. To me that sounds like I have wasted a lot of time for a simple administrative request. I mainly have been transporting papers from home to one office, and from one office to another; something which could easily have been done by mail. I know that I have to show up in person to get an identification document, but does this have to be for each and every step???

Soon after that, old-timer NedStat got bought by <a href=\"http://www.webstats4u.com/\">WebStats4U</a>, which lost most of its clients by adding unwanted advertising to sites using the NedStat counter. And last week Google re-launched <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analyitics/\">Google Analytics</a>, previously known as Urchin. There is a lot going on in a market just as old as the Internet.</p>\n<p>As long as people have created web pages, they have been interested in knowing who is visiting their pages. Most web statistics packages already exist for years, and the only changes they have made to their products are the inclusion of new browser detection and more advanced bot filtering. And the inclusion of RSS readers of course.</p>\n<p>The first statistics I ever used was the NedStat counter. I only had to place an image on my home page, and NedStat would tell me the referrer pages, countries, and browsers. Ver neat!</p>\n<p>Then I moved to another hosting provider, which gave me access to the server logs. I installed <a href=\"http://awstats.sourceforge.net/\">AWStats</a> and got <a href=\"/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com\">incredible statistics</a>. Now I can see which search bots spidered my site, which file types are more popular, and which files are missing (404 errors). It is all in the server logs!</p>\n<p>And now I am playing with <a href=\"http://google.com/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a>. Google's application does not use my server logs, but require me to add a piece of JavaScript to each page. The results are once again a step up from what I had: Google does not only show technical reports, but also has <em>views</em> for marketers and executives, showing things like ROI and tracking your <em>goals</em>.</p>\n<p>As a technology-oriented person, I first set the <em>webmaster view</em> as my default view. But Google's webmaster view gives me less information than AWStats. It does not tell me about 404 errors, it does not show me bandwidth numbers, it does not show me login names.… The other views in Analyze are great, and very useful when managing my sites, but I do miss webmaster information.</p>\n<p>I wish it would be possible to ‘enrich’ the data Google collects with my server log files, <a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com/\">FeedBurner </a> reports, etc. With <a href=\"http://google.com/base/\">Google Base</a> they laid the foundation for adding content, they only have to implement in into analyze.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/b1e6908e1e.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Google Analytics\" />\n",

So I want to add Google Analytics to my other sites.</p>\n<p>In the Website Profiles screen I read: <em>To track another website with Analytics, click the 'Add Website Profile' link</em>, but there is no such link in that screen. The help function directs me to the signup screen with the message that they do not accept new signups. What to do?</p>\n<p>I loaded the Website Profiles page in my favourite HTML editor, and find the following code:</p>\n\n<code>\n&lt;!--\n&lt;td class=\"list_control_cell\" align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"plus\"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=\"admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX\" class=\"normal\"&gt;Add Website Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n--&gt;\n</code>\n\n<p>They simply commented out the ‘Add Website Profile’ button! I open the page linked in the code, and Google adds my new website profile without any problem! So to add another website profile, you only have to log-in at Google Analytics and go to the following URL, replacing the XXXXXX by your own user number:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX\">https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX</a></p>\n",

So I checked the manufacturer's web site top see where I could buy it. After phoning all possible shops in Lleida, I reverted to an on-line shop. I looked at the available options and choose the <a href=\"http://tecnologia.carrefour.es\" rel=\"nofollow\">biggest company</a>. That turned out to be my biggest mistake:</p>\n<p>On <strong>October 24</strong> I connected to their site, found my item and saw that they had it on stock. The site mentioned a delivery time of 7 days, which was fine, since I needed it in 14 days.</p>\n<p><strong>October 25</strong><br>\nI received an e-mail confirming my order, after one day!, and a request for a copy of my identification card. Of course I immediately sent this.</p>\n<p><strong>October 28</strong><br>\nI checked the order status on the web, since I had not received a confirmation of reception of my message. The status mentioned ‘missing information’, so I sent an e-mail asking for the current status.</p>\n<p><strong>October 31</strong><br>\nI still hadn't heard anything, and started to become a little bit nervous. So I phoned their customer support. They told me that there was a delay, and they were waiting for their supplier to deliver the goods. They could not explain me why the item was shown to be in stock when I made my order.</p>\n<p><strong>November 2</strong><br>\nI received an e-mail from them, telling me that there had been an ‘incident’. I phoned them and asked them whether they would be able to deliver the item on time, since I needed it in 6 days. They assured me that it would not be a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>November 3</strong><br>\nI would not let them forget me, so I phoned again. They told me that they had the item in their central warehouse, and that it was now passing quality control. They should be able to send it me in one week. I patiently explained them that I really need the item in a few days. The nice guy one the other side said that he understood me and that he would pass a message to the quality control department. I expected that it would be possible to ship it to me on the next day, but told me to phone again.</p>\n<p><strong>November 4</strong><br>\nI faithfully phoned again, hoping that they'd been able to send me my device. But instead of that, the nice lady tells me that they can not deliver within the next two weeks. Besides that, she tells me that there has not been noted anything about my phone call the day before! I explain once more that I really need the device, and that they'd promised me that it would be possible to deliver it on time, but she says that there is nothing she can do. I cancel my order…</p>\n<p>Only little time left, so all I can do is find a shop that has the device in stock and pick it up personally. I start with the big outlets in Barcelona, and after phoning 7 of them I am able to reserve my item. I hop in the car, drive 160 kilometres, pay some money —hé, this shop is even cheaper than what I found on Internet!— and drive home happily. I promise everybody that I won't buy anything from Carrefour!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Though RSS feeds are still only used by the ‘<em>lucky few</em>’, I discovered several phases of RSS reading behaviour:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>In <strong>phase 1</strong> you discover RSS. You are very enthusiastic about having the possibility to see all the news from your favourite resources in one place. When visiting a web site you first look for the orange XML or RSS icon to subscribe. People in phase 1 typically subscribe to 1-50 feeds. You feel very efficient, since all news automagically appears in your feed reader; you've saved yourself hours of useless browsing;</li>\n    <li>After a while you realize that there is a lot more out there: your 50 feeds are not even the top of the iceberg. You have entered <strong>phase 2</strong>. Once in while you find an interesting post outside your feeds, but since the rest of the posts from this author are about his cats you decided not to subscribe. Since you don't want to miss the good posts you set up some ‘search feeds’: <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/\">Technorati</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pubsub.com/\">PubSub</a>, <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com/\">Feedster</a>, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> and friends search the blogsphere for your interest, and automatically notify you. You spend hours tweaking your queries, since you don't want to miss anything. All feeds are nicely organized with a separate folder per subject. You are now checking over 100 feeds on a daily basis;</li>\n    <li>What started with 5 minutes every day, now cost you over an hour. And you can't skip a single day, since that will cost you two hours next day. <strong>Phase 3</strong> is hard work, with an ever increasing number of feeds to read. <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/30.html#a8331\">Robert Scoble mentioned reading 900+ feeds</a>! You know that something has to happen, so you start wielding out your feeds. You unsubscribe feeds of old contacts, feeds about subjects you are no longer interested in, feeds of dead sites… You also put a break on the new feeds you subscribe to. You create a '‘<em>probation</em>’ folder for new feeds, and selectively promote feeds to your main folders. Despite all these efforts you don't feel like you're in control: you are juggling instead;</li>\n    <li>Usually external influences force you into <strong>phase 4</strong>. You simply don't have the time anymore to spend hours a day reading. There are two ways to deal with phase 4: people who go the drastical way simply delete all their feeds, except for the 10 feeds that really matter. After all, if something really important happens everybody will write about it within a few hours. The trick is to pick out the relevant feeds publishing all the news you are interested in.\nOther people are more careful, and simply regroup their feeds by reading frequency: the 10 feeds to be read daily, about 50 feeds to be read once a week if you have time, and many feeds more just in case you want to read them on a bored Sunday afternoon. Reading is a pleasure again, and you feel in control knowing that you can't possibly read everything out there but won't miss any important news.</li>\n    <li>In <strong>phase 5</strong> you see the light! Imagine an army of professional editors searching all available news, and selecting the best pieces. Even better, they publish their results on a handy paper based format called tabloid, which you can take with you wherever you want. And finally, you will be interrupted only once a day.</li>\n</ol>\n\n[Insert fancy graph here]\n\nInspired by Jason Kottke, I entered phase 4 today. I regrouped all my feeds, and reduced the number of feeds in Bloglines. Furthermore I told Bloglines to notify me only when new items appear in my 'top' folder. The first result has been amazing. I had a busy day, so only read my top feeds. I still have a feeling of what is going on whithout having to spend a lot of time reading.\n",

One of the first measures I took against comment spam was renaming this script, so bots using Google to find spammable sites would not find me. With the latest update, I forgot to do so. Now, the list with spammable URIs these spambots use, contain hundreds of links to a script that does not exist anymore. So they do not even reach my comment-spam filters!\n\nEven better, they fall into another trap. I catch all request for ‘inapropiate’ files as system files and non-existing scripts (formmail.pl), and automatically put their IP address on a blacklist, which is cleaned up after two weeks. This blacklist has been growing like crazy the last week, due to all these MT-spammers requesting the old location.\n\nUntil they refresh their list, I can sit back and relax!\n",

This encourages him to respond promptly to your needs, and it keeps you from waiting at the bar. A pre-tip is always at least 5 dollars (and more often 10 or above, depending on how crowded or upscale the bar is). Despite the amount, it should not comprise the whole of your tipping.

The driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the shepherd…\n\n“If I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?”\n\nThe shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully-grazing flock and calmly answered, “Sure.”\n\nThe yuppie parked his car, whipped out his IBM Thinkpad and connected it to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas. He sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a response. Finally, he prints out a 130 page report on his miniaturized printer then turns to the shepherd and says… “You have exactly 1586 sheep.”\n\n“That is correct; take one of the sheep.”said the shepherd.\n\nHe watches the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his car. Then the shepherd says: “If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my animal?”\n\n“OK, why not.” answered the young man.\n\n“Clearly, you are a consultant.” said the shepherd.\n\n“That's correct.” says the yuppie, “but how did you guess that?”\n\n“No guessing required.” answers the shepherd. “You turned up here although nobody called you.

				"content_text": "<p>Some weeks ago, we decided to change mobile provider. We have a contract with Telefonica Movistar, but most people we phone with are at Amena. We did some calculation and came to the conclusion that we could save on our bill by changing to Amena as well.</p>\n<p>This weekend we finally found the time to head to the Amena office, and we explained out plans. The nice lady in the shop asked us some questions on our phone behaviour, who, when and how much, and she explained us about all the possibilities of the different packages. We made some quick estimations and selected the ‘right’ package.</p>\n<p>Then the more important question came. Carriers earn so much money with all their inflated rates, that they can give away expensive toys. We could choose a new phone! MJ had prepared herself, and knew what her demands were: she wanted the cheapest phone that could flip open. Until now she always had candy-bar phones, but now she wanted clamshell. All other functions did not matter, since she only use the device for phoning and sending SMS messages. Her choice was the NEC e242.</p>\n<p>Of course, as a reader of mobile expert <a href=\"http://russellbeattie.com/notebook/\">Russell Beattie</a>, I know that there is more. Russ has the most incredible applications and uses for his mobiles, and it seems that he uses his mobile for everything I still use a PC for. But his phones are, even after the carrier discount, so incredibly expensive that it would take me years to earn that back with the cheaper rate of Amena. I guess Russ lives in another realm, but most people here choose between the five cheapest models. So I set my mind together, and thought logically. I don't phone a lot, I use SMS even less, and once in a while I use WAP to spend some dead time. Basically, any phone would be enough. But hey, I am a gadget freak, so I should have something additional to wish for, right? Maybe I need a camera on my phone, to update my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/\">photo page</a> more often. That's it! I looked around, and saw a nice and cheap Samsung phone that according to the specs had a camera. I asked if I could see it, and fell in love with the device. Cool design, very light weight (they show the phones without batteries), but… without camera. I asked the friendly lady if she could show me the camera, but no, they'd made an error in the specs. So I took the cheapest camera phone they had: the NEC e242.</p>\n<p>Now we have to find a way to keep our new phones separated!</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/e87aa34cbc.png\" width=\"193\" height=\"311\" alt=\"NEC e242\" />\n",

The trigger was the article <a title=\"Stinky links\" href=\"http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/02/stinky_links.html\">Stinky links</a> by Matt Haughey. At that moment I had just <a title=\"Feeds outsourced\" href=\"/2005/02/feeds_outsourced/\">created my FeedBurner feed</a> combining my posts with my Flickr photo's and my linkdump, and I knew that I had done something wrong. Readers following me because of my Movable Type writings are probably not interested in my holiday photo's, and people who want to know about my life abroad don't want to be bothered by my link dump. This site has a lack of focus, and I only made it worse.</p>\n<p>The feed readers have the biggest problem, since they don't see the context of each entry. On the home page, my ‘<em>normal</em>’ entries take up the bulk of the space, the links are shown in the sidebar, and the latest photo is shown in the sidebar as well. People who read my feed, don't see the context; the three content types appear in exactly the same way. To solve this, I am going to offer three more feeds: one for my weblog, one for the links and one for the photos. They will be added to the current everything-in-one feed, to give my readers more choice.</p>\n<p>Once the biggest problem has been solved, I want to restructure the links section. My main problem is the category structure, since I find it increasingly difficult to correctly place the items. I have to review the existing categories and their items, and will probably start using a tree structure with sub-categories.</p>\n<p>Next, I want to split the weblog part in two parts: a web–tech site and a personal site.</p>\n<p>First I will have to find out how to move certain categories from one weblog to another, but a little bit of SQL-fu should do, right? To link everything together I would like to change my homepage to a gateway to the different parts of the Brain tags empire. I guess this would also be the right moment for a new stylesheet, as I am getting fed up with light blue as well.</p>\n<p>Once all that work has been done I want to start a new site, focused on a subject I work on every day, but which does not show up often on weblogs: point of sale software and hardware. I still have to work out my ideas on this subject, and I want to talk it over with some people, since it comes awfully close to a business weblog, but I think it would add something to the current blogosphere.</p>\n<p>These are my ideas on the near future of Brain Tags. What is your opinion? Am I right, or should I go in another direction? I would like to hear and read your opinions.</p>\n<p><strong>[Update 2005.02.17]</strong>: The first step has been taken. I added a new feed for the photo's: <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainpics\">http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainpics</a>.</p>\n",

Not that my comment spam problem became bigger, since my setup is different enough from the regular MT site to stop them. I have renamed my comment script and, more important, I force commenters to preview. This alone blocks all spam coming in through the comments.\n\nThe problem is that once in a while I receive spam through the trackback interface. Since trackbacks, comments on my writings left on other sites, are always generated automatically, I have no way to force a preview and have to use the default workflow. As a result, once in a while a spammer gets through and manages to place many spam on my site before I have the time to add his URL to the blacklist. Of course, after that all spam is deleted with a single click.\n\nConclusion: So far I am still winning the spam war, but only because I am on top of it with upgrades and by quickly removing spam.\n",

The biggest benefit is that it can handle everything I do with external scripts: searching, guest book, forum, … Secondly, its multi-language implementation is great; the properties of each object can be entered in several languages, which will be shown to the visitor depending on the site access used.</p>\n<p>I still have to play around a lot more to get to know its possibilities better, but I certainly have a very good feeling about this software.</p>\n",

We regret this decision but after putting our best resources to work it has become obvious that the damage caused by the corruption is irreversible.\n\nWe would like to thank everyone that has made the last year and a half a great one.</blockquote>\n",

Until some years ago, they had a nice web site with plastic ducks and other toys as decoration. I made this site using Microsoft Frontpage, and maintained it for some years. It contained stories about the activities of this club, which had its highlight in 2000, with an appearance in the Dutch men magazine the <em>Panorama</em> and the production of their CD <em>Dagobert, de heerser hier</em>. Shortly after, the site disappeared, and the club became dormant.</p>\n<p>Last week I accidentally found the text published in the Panorama, and thought that it was a pity that the history of the DDC is not available on the internet. But wait, maybe the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www1.tip.nl/~t086868/ddc/\">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a> has saved something of that site. Indeed, it was all there. I quickly installed <a href=\"http://www.mamboserver.com/\">Mambo Open Source</a> on my server, created a new subdomain, configured Mambo and copied the texts into new entries. And there it is: the <a title=\"Dooie Donders Club\" href=\"http://ddc.braintags.com/\">DDC</a> is back!!!</p>\n<p>At the moment is a pretty default Mambo site, but I plan to make some custom templates to give the site some Dooie Donders sauce.</p>\n",

It was developed as a measure against comment spam, and made available in version 3.0 of MT. After TypeKey was released I changed my templates to include this system. I do not force commenters to use TypeKey, since my spam problem is not <em>that</em> big.</p>\n<p>This was in May. Now after some months more, I have some observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Besides me, only <del>one</del>two commenters used TypeKey to comment on this site;</li>\n<li>No other MT–powered site I comment on has TypeKey activated;</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?&q=typekey%20profile%20page%20-site:typekey.com\">Google search</a> on the default TypeKey comment link — TypeKey Profile Page — returns only 21000 hits. So only 21000 pages on the whole web have TypeKey authenticated comments — remember that some sites have many pages, with many posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me it looks like TypeKey is not used a lot.</p>\n<h2>Why can that be?</h2>\n<p>I think the main reason is that most of the sites using Movable Type never update their templates. They might update to a newer version of MT, but leave their templates alone. And they are right in doing so; I remember that it was quite a puzzle to add the TypeKey code to my template.</p>\n<h2>So TypeKey is a failure?</h2>\n<p>After only four months, it is very early to make this kind of conclusions. Every new site that starts using MT will probably have TypeKey activated, so I expect more and more sites to use is. And when the base grows, other sites might benefit more from this service as well.</p>\n",

What happened is the following:\n\nBoth machines run Windows XP, and use a modem — in one case an ADSL modem — to connect to internet. Everything works just fine, until I added a network card to these machines. After that, the modem seems to connect just fine, but DNS is not working. The computer has received the IP addresses of the DNS servers, and I can ping to these addresses. Furthermore, when I try a <code>tracert</code>, I receive the error <code>No hay recursos</code> — no resources.

I know many people are stuck with Microsoft Outlook because their company uses an Exchange server, but that is not the case with me; I am free to choose. I use Microsoft Outlook because it allows me to do some things I can't accomplish with other tools, even though there are many things I don't like about Outlook.</p>\n<p>The main feature that has become indispensable for my is the fact that I can adjust any view to my needs. I have a huge list of contacts, which I have grouped in two levels (country and company). That way I can quickly find contact information. Unfortunately, when I select a contact from a new message window, all I have is a huge flat list of contacts. Another feature I use frequently us the ability to add fields to items. All my task fields have an additional field called 'project', where I put the name of the project this task belongs to. If I group my tasks by project I have a good overview off all pending items per project.</p>\n<p>The features mentioned above are essential for my functioning in the office. Some other features are simply handy to have. For example, conditional formatting allows me to change the <em>view</em> of an item, so that I can see quickly which items have to be processed today or in the coming week, and which items are in progress.</p>\n<p>As bloated as Outlook may be (partly fixed by some add-ons), I haven't found a better PIM.</p>\n",

I am very happy with my Canon film camera, but after I have been playing with my parents' new Sony digital camera last week I wondered whether a digital camera would be something for me. Of course as a gadget it would most certainly be welcome, but as a replacement for my current film camera it will need to add much additional benefits. So I made a little comparison:\n\n<h2>Pro digital:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Electronic format</strong>\nLogically, digital cameras store photographs in a digital format. This makes it very easy to save them on your PC.</li>\n    <li><strong>Easier handling</strong>\nRelated to the digital format, photographs taken with a digital camera are much easier to publish to the internet, to e-mail to your friends and relatives and to catalogue. Besides that you can easily retouch them using graphical editing software.</li>\n    <li><strong>No film rolls</strong>\nSince you don't need to buy film rolls, the costs per photograph will drop significantly.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cheaper workflow</strong>\nWith a digital camera you work different. You shoot your pictures, delete the ones you don't like, store them on you PC and maybe you will print your best pictures. This is a very cheap process.</li>\n    <li><strong>Quantity gives quality</strong>\nBecause the workflow is so cheap, you generally make many more images. This has two big benefits for the image quality: first you simply have a bigger chance making a photograph at the right place and the right time and secondly the more pictures you make, the more experienced you become. Professional photographers use the same tactic, but using film makes it way too expensive for amateur photographers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Pro film:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Higher resolution</strong>\nIt is difficult to compare two completely different techniques, but in general film cameras have a much higher resolution. In digital cameras the important parameter is the number of Megapixels — even though the sensor size is more important — so experts have been trying to calculate this number for film cameras. Results vary, but most conclude that film cameras have a resolution between 15 and 25 Megapixels.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bigger enlargements</strong>\nThe quality of enlargements is another feature in which the traditional camera beats the newcomers. A photograph made with a film camera can easily be enlarged to 40 by 50 centimetres, while a digital photograph will start losing quality at 20 by 25 cm.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cheaper cameras</strong>\nFilm cameras cost only a fraction of their digital equivalents; sometimes they are even 90% cheaper.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dynamic range</strong>\nDigital photo chips have limits in dynamic range; at a certain moment a change in subject brightness won't result in a change in image brightness anymore. Films do not have this hard limit, but rather become less and less sensitive. The dynamic range of films is larger than the dynamic range of photo chips.</li>\n    <li><strong>Proven technology</strong>\nFilm cameras on the market now do not differ much from those on the market five years ago. In general you buy a camera and use it until it stops working. A digital camera however, is new technology that is still being developed. You new 6 megapixel camera will be considered old within a year. I don't know anybody who is still using his one megapixel camera he bought two years ago, but I know several people still using a film camera they bought over a decade ago.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn short, digital cameras give you ease of use and electronic access to your photographs, while film cameras give you quality and are cheaper. The choice is up to you. For me it is not so important having a digital photograph — though I would like to publish more photo's on this site. On a cold Sunday in winter, I like to grab a photo album and browse through the images on my sofa. I don't think I can have that same feeling sitting behind my computer. For the moment I still prefer film cameras to digital cameras, but maybe I might buy a very cheap digital camera for those moments I want to send a photo by e-mail or publish it on this site.\n",

				"content_text": "Four days ago I upgraded the motor of this site to Movable Type version 3.0D — the D is for Developer edition. Unlike many others who installed this version, I was fully aware that this developer edition could have some problems with plug-ins. Here are my findings of the first days playing around.\n\n<strong>Dashboard</strong>\n\nThe first screen of the MT interface clearly shows a new item: the Movable Type News box. This box syndicates news from the Movable Type web site. Since I prefer to read my news in my feed reader, I immediately <a title=\"Brain Tags: Remove Movable Type News box\" href=\"/archives/2004/05/remove_movable_type_news_box/\">removed this box</a>.\n\nAnother thing changed in the main screen is the direct access to some weblog features. The 2.x versions had for each weblog links to create a new entry and to enter the entries list. Now you can also access the comments list, the templates list and the weblog configuration screen. The one thing I am missing here is the upload file feature, since I assume that bloggers will more often upload an image than tinker with their templates.\n\n<strong>Edit Entry</strong>\n\nAlso the Entry Edit screen has some —minor— modifications. It is now possible to specify the entry date &amp; time the moment you create a new entry. In the older versions you first had to save your entry to modify the publishing time. That leaves only one feature that cannot be modified in new entries: the multiple categories.\n\nAnother change is that the edit buttons now also work in Mozilla based browsers, but only for the entry body. If you use the extended entry field, you still have to enter the HTML code yourself.\n\n<strong>Comments</strong>\n\nThe comments list is new and handy feature to manage your comments. You can see the details and the status of the last comments, and open them from that screen. You can filter comments on e-mail, name and IP address, but unfortunately not on status. I don't receive many comments, but I assume that more popular sites would love to see only the comments that are pending for approval.\n\n<strong>Trackback</strong>\n\nIn my definition, trackbacks are nothing more than comments on my entries left on other sites. I would like to treat trackbacks in exactly the same way as comments, but unfortunately trackbacks do not have status information.\n\n<strong>Plug-ins</strong>\n\nOf the 13 plug-ins I use for this site, I removed two after upgrading.\n<a title=\"MT-Blacklist: The collective deep breath\" href=\"http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2004/05/the_collective_deep_breath\">MT-Blacklist is not compatible with MT3.0</a>, so I am removing comment spammers by hand again.\n\nThe Optional-Redirect plug-in is not necessary anymore, since <a title=\"David Raynes: Optional-Redirect is of no use in MT 3.0\" href=\"http://www.rayners.org/2004/05/17/optionalredirect_is_of_no_use_in_mt_30.php\">the same can be achieved in MT 3.0</a> by <code>no_redirect=\"1\"</code>.\n\nAll other plug-ins work the same way as before.\n\n<strong>Individual Archive template</strong>\n\nMost of my time went into trying to adjust the individual archive template. There have been many changes to this template to incorporate the TypeKey service, but I have not yet been able to get them to work when served as XHTML 1.1 with MIME type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. The smallest problem was to validate the template as XHTML 1.1. The new code uses some <code>name</code>s, which I changed into <code>id</code>s, and I had to edit <code>lib/MT/Template/Context.pm</code> so it won't use <code>valign</code> and <code>border</code> anymore -- look at line 1476.\n\nA bigger problem is the JavaScript. Things like <code>document.comments_form.email.value</code> is easy enough changed into <code>document.getElementById('email').value</code>, but I don't know how to fix <code>document.write</code> so it works both on <code>text/html</code> as on <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.\n\nThe last problem I have with my template is that it shows the wrong comment form; the one that is normally used when TypeKey authentication is obligatory. I still have to find out what is going wrong here.\n",

Therefore, more and more sites I visit are standards compliant: clean HTML and designed with CSS. In my opinion Firefox does not handle these sites correctly, since it only starts loading background images the moment I focus on a tab. Thus many times I close a tab, I am confronted with an almost white page with some text on it, which then is converted little by little in a beautiful design. I do not understand why Firefox waits until I focus on the tab and does not pre-load the background images while I am reading other sites.\n\nOr is there some hidden configuration option I don't know about?\n",

This to initiate them to the Catalan culture of spending a lot of time eating and drinking, usually a few hours later than they do in Holland -- we had supper at 23:00.\nSaturday morning was a typical vacation morning. After sleeping a bit longer than usual, taking a shower and having a long breakfast, the morning was over. Time to head over to the city centre to take a beer on a terrace! Back home we had a long lunch and a short sleep (siesta!). When it started to become dark we walked outside to do some window shopping and compare the prices with those in Holland. In the evening Berry and I went to see a Basketball match, while Manon and Maria José had some tapas. We finished the day in a fine restaurant.\nAfter so much eating and drinking, we decided to have a slightly more active day on Sunday. The morning was the same as on Saturday, but after that we took the car to visit Montserrat and Sitges. At the end of the day we left them in front of a hotel in the middle of the Ramblas of Barcelona, so they would not have to travel a lot on Monday.\nBerry and Manon: thanks for getting us to relax!\n",

For example, a link to this site appears as:\n\n<code>http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red<strong>&amp;</strong>u=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2F\"<code></code></code>\n\nwhile they should have used:\n\n<code>http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red<strong>&amp;amp;</strong>u=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2F\"<code></code></code>\n\nI did a quick search in the new files, and found the error in the file <code>lib/MT/Template/Context.pm</code> at line 1189. Just add 4 characters, and MT produces valid HTML again.\n\n<strong>[Update 2004.01.16]</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/\">Six Apart</a> published MT version 2.661 to fix this problem.\n",

But this way the LOAF technology is kept away from the big audience, who know nothing about programming. In my opinion, LOAF should be more easy to use, Joe Sixpack should be able to use it on his blog. And that preferably by only changing a single setting in his weblogging software.\n\nSo, I decided to create a LOAF implementation in CSS. Notice that this stylesheet is XHTML1.1 ready, since it also styles the <code><html></code> element. You only need to copy the file to your server and your site is completely LOAF-compliant.\n\nTo use the LOAF CSS implementation on your site, follow the steps below:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Download the <a href=\"http://braintags.com/images/loaf.css\">LOAF CSS file</a>;</li>\n    <li>Replace the stylesheet for your site with the contents of the file you just downloaded (MT users: read the <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_templates.html#default%20templates\">instructions</a> on the Movable Type site).</li>\n    <li>That's all!</li>\n</ul>\n",

Sometimes when I visit a site, I also check the statistics of that site. What kind of people are reading that site? Where do they come from? What were they looking for? All very interesting information…</p>\n<p>My own visitors could not have a look behind the screens of this site, since my access statistics are located on the management control panel, safely protected by a password.</p>\n<p>The application to generate these statistics is called <a title=\"Free log file analyzer for advanced statistics\" href=\"http://awstats.sourceforge.net/\">AWStats</a>, which I was using already before I moved to my current hosting provider. Since I knew the structure of the application, I figured that it should be possible to install AWStats myself, and have my copy point to the data files that are generated automatically by my provider's copy of AWStats.</p>\n<p>And that is exactly what I've done. I only needed to copy the main <code>awstats.pl</code> file, the <code>lib</code> directory and the <code>icons</code> directories, and could use the existing configuration file (after changing the <code>DirCgi</code> parameter) to have everything working.</p>\n<p>So now everybody can <a title=\"Statistics of braintags.com\" href=\"/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com\">check my access statistics</a>!!!</p>\n<p>Maybe someday I will create an <em>About this site</em> page, on which I will put a permanent link to my statistics. Some people put this link on their home page, but in my opinion this feature is of no use to the general visitor, and only adds bloat to the home page.</p>\n",

The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body in the request message.</q>\n\nIt appears that a server is returning code 411 when a client (=browser) tries to send data to the server without specifying the size of the data. Normally a client only receives data from the server (reading pages), and all common modern browsers are programmed in such a way that they include the data length when sending data.\n\nTherefore I suspected that somebody with a home-grown application had tried to mess with my site.\nI did a quick grep in my Apache log files and found out that somebody had accessed the file mt-xmlrpc.cgi with an application that identified itself as <code>Java/1.4.1_01</code>.\n\nThis file is a XML-RPC interface to Movable Type, allowing other applications to interact with MT, for example to publish entries on this site from a special desktop client.\n\nSince I am the only responsible for this site, nobody but me has any reason to use this file. This visitor also triggered my Spam trap, and was already blocked from my system, but if not, his badly programmed application did ring the alarm bell.\n",

The first thing I will do today, the second one may take several months.\n\n<strong>[Update 31.07.2003]</strong>: I just removed Image Gallery and changed my .htaccess file to redirect all requests to my photo log.\n",

This plugin allows me to do this.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->perlscript<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAgain a very low-level plugin. This plugin allows me to execute Perl scripts from my templates. I use it to create my yearly archive pages, since MT only offers monthly archives.

By default, MT keeps them separated, providing a list of comments and a list of trackbacks. In my point of view, comments and trackbacks are basically the same, but in different places. Therefore, I prefer to have a single comments list, with both the comments residing on my site as the comments written on other sites. SimpleComments does this for me.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->smartypants<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nSmartypants fixes the typographic punctuation of my entries.

Wrong! There are a number of reasons why I (and many other people) consider HTML mail harmful:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail wastes bandwidth</strong>\nHTML code adds usually 200% to the size of the message. I know, for your short message this is only a very little bit, but if I have been away for the weekend and find tens of HTML messages I urgently want to read, I get nervous when I am waiting 5 minutes (yes, I am using a slow modem) while it could have been finished within 2 minutes!</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail is more vulnerable for viruses</strong>\nThis is a really important one. By using HTML mail, one of the main security principles are broken: separate code from content. HTML mail (content) can contain scripts (code) that virus writers exploit. Many of the famous Trojan Worms would never have been spread around if people would have used plain text messages by default.</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail can connect to the internet</strong>\nThis is something used a lot in spam. They include an image which is stored on their server and insert it into the message with some kind of parameter. The moment you read the message, the image is fetched from their server, passing the parameter to the sender of the message. The result is that your e-mail address will be listed as ‘verified’ and therefore will receive more spam.</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML incompatibilities</strong>\nMost people who create websites know how difficult it is to create a page that looks alright on all mayor browsers. Guess what? E-mail clients have the same problems! The message that looks perfect in your Outlook Express can look completely different on the computer of your sister, who uses Eudora to read her mail. And there are still people around with mail applications that don't support HTML at all!</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail is slow</strong>\nPlain text messages only have to be shown on screen, but ‘rich’ messages need preprocessing. Especially on old computers the difference is very clear. Wait, hasn't your neighbour still got that old-timer Pentium II? Better send him plain text next time, I am sure he will appreciate it! This does not only go for old computers, but more and more people start reading their mail using PDA's or cellphones.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn short: unless you have very good reasons to use HTML mail, I would ask you to send plain text messages. If the appearance of the message is so important, you're probably better off by sending it as a PDF attachment or publishing it on a web page; those media are suited better for this task.\n\nGo ahead, <a title=\"Configuring Mail Clients to Send Plain ASCII Text\" href=\"http://www.expita.com/nomime.html\">configure your mail client to send plain ASCII text</a>.\n",

Since it was already late, we quickly sung the welcome song prepared by the family, cut the pie, congratulated the couple and sat down to (finally) have a drink.\n\nWhile we were relaxing and talking at our table, more and more people entered. Both Berry and Manon are very active Harmelen, Berry in <a title=\"The national Jong Nederland organisation\" href=\"http://www.jongnederland.nl\">Jong</a> <a title=\"Jong Nederland Harmelen\" href=\"http://jnharmelen.nl/\">Nederland</a>, <a title=\"Soccer Club Harmelen\" href=\"http://www.sch44.nl/\">SCH</a>, <a title=\"Darts club The Pirates\" href=\"http://www.vdlit.tmfweb.nl/pirates/\">the Pirates</a>, de <a title=\"Carnavals Vereniging De Kwakbollen\" href=\"http://www.kwakbollen.nl/\">Kwakbollen</a>, and Manon in EHBO.\n\nAfter filling our stomachs we were ready again for the final party, with even more people than appeared on the reception. I tried to speak at least some minutes with all my old friends, but one evening is by far too short for this. At least I (and Maria José as well) had a lot of fun.\n\nSunday before leaving home again we visited Berry and Manon at home. We watched (parts of) the video made and talked a lot about <em>the</em> day…\n\nWednesday they will leave to Florida, where they will visit Disney World (they are huge fans of Disney) and have a cruise through the Caribbean.\n\nI wish them a good time, and hope to see them soon again.\n\n<strong>[Update 2004.01.21]</strong>: Changed link to JNH\n",

Internet was new and after playing with <a href=\"http://www.scn.org/~bkarger/gopher-manifesto\">gopher</a> I installed Mosaic on my Macintosh and made my first page. In fact it was nothing more that a bulleted list with my favourite sites.</li>\n    <li><strong>V2</strong>: In 1997 I bought myself a new computer with modem. With my internet connection came some space on the server for my personal homepage. I installed FrontPage (like everybody in that time), chose a nice theme and typed in my texts. Later I linked my CD database to this site, gaining a lot of links from music lovers.</li>\n    <li>V3: The site you are reading now, created in 2001. In the meantime I had learned that FrontPage creates bloated, non-standard pages, so I created this site as a pure site. Written completely on Notepad. I installed two perl scripts (NewsPro and Image Gallery) to handle the dynamical content, and that's it!</li>\n    <li><strong>V4</strong>: As my sites always have been used mainly for testing purposes, I will go one step further. V4 will be hosted on my own server, and I will probably use the Zope Application Server, with Plone on top of it. Besides my old sites, I will probably continue to write short stories about my life (even though I know that I am not the greatest writer), but I will probably split them into personal and technical stories. The comments feature is almost never used, so I will replace it by a conventional guestbook. I have a lot of other ideas, but I won't bother you with it now...</li>\n</ul>\n\nBesides my personal sites, I have been working on three more sites.

The oldest layer turns into some sticky mess as soon as you try to remove it, and turns into stone on your tools. Besides that, the fine structure carved into the doors don't make it easier to clean them…\n\nBecause of the hard work, my father did not have a lot of time for social contacts, which is a big crime in this country! Therefor all social activities were propped into Saturday.\n\nIn the morning we had breakfast in the house of a friend of the parents on Maria José. Since this was a special occasion, they'd fired up the grill to prepare a big pile of meat (and that for breakfast!!!!)\n\nAfter the breakfast we took a short walk through the yards and went home to prepare ourselves for lunch. After being home for only one our, we went to the house of the parent of Maria José, te eat soup, french fries and… a chicken!! I wasn't really hungry when I went for lunch (understatement), but after lunch I felt just as stuffed as the chicken I had been eating. I was happy to sleep a little after lunch (my father of course continued working), knowing that in the evening we would go to a nice restaurant to eat some more…\n",

				"content_text": "One month ago we moved to our new house. Since then, things have settled down, but one thing still is missing: our working room still serves as a storage room, with my old computer packed into boxes.\n\nUntil that moment we both use my (even older) Toshiba Satellite Pro 400 CDT. This computer is not really fast, but in the mean time I have gotten used to it. It's really comfortable working on the sofa, but to connect to internet I have to move to the floor of the hallway. For the moment we have this solution, but sometimes one computer just isn't enough for two people.\n\nThat's why I dug up my <em>really</em> old laptop, a 486 with 8 Mb memory and 525 Mb harddisk, but without CD player. I once installed Windows 98, but it wasn't running perfectly. Besides this, I don't have a licence for this machine, and don't want to buy one. Therefore I decided to install GNU/Linux on it.\n\nTaken the absence of the CD-player and the minimal hardware, I started looking for a floppy-based distribution. I once used the <a href=\"http://jspiro.tripod.com/linux/hal91.htm\">HAL91</a> distribution, but this only runs on a RAM disk, while I want to be able to install it onto my harddisk. Then I found <a href=\"http://mulinux.sunsite.dk\">MuLinux</a>, a tiny single floppy based distribution with the ability to copy the installation to the harddisk, and with some add-on floppies to install additional features like the X-Windows system, Wine, TeX, … It looked promising, so I set to work.\n\nWhile the disk images were downloading to my Toshiba laptop, I started the other laptop from a DOS bootdisk to format the harddisk. It had quite some bad sectors, but that shouldn't be a big problem. In the mean time the download was finished. I extracted the DOSTOOLS to <code>C:\\mulinux</code> and copied the images (BOOT, WKS, SRV en X11) to the same directory. Next, I runned <code>unpack.bat</code>, which opened the main archive <code>mulinux-13r2.tgz</code>. Then I fired up makefi.bat, which created an installation disk. Since muLinux distribution running from floppy, installation means preparing the floppies. After the installation disk was prepared, I rebooted my Toshiba, after which the installation process prepared the BOOT floppy.\n\nI immediately took this floppy to my old laptop and booted it with it. It booted nicely and started the configuration procedure. The first thing I had to do was configure the swap space. The harddisk was DOS formatted, but I want to install my linux on a ext2 partition. Therefore I decided to boot the machine with only the necessary configuration, after which I should be able to use the linux fdisk utility to partition the harddisk.

And if you know that Dago doesn't have any girlfriend or wife, the first question is WHO he chose to be on his side.\n\nThe tension was really high when Dago finally appeared. Of course we faked our surprise to see him (I <em>never</em> could have guessed it could be him…), but immediately everybody started looking around, searching for the princess.\n\nBut no–… to our disappointment, this Dago has chosen to celebrate carnival alone.\nAlaaf for prince Remi XXVI!\n",
