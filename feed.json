				"content_html": "<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been a loyal user of the Reeder app to keep up with my favorite feeds. The classic version, as it&rsquo;s now called, has been my go-to tool for organizing and reading articles. I meticulously sorted everything into folders and made it a daily ritual to check for new content, whether in the morning or sometimes even in the afternoon. It was my way of staying updated on the topics that interest me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-paradigm-in-reeder\">A new paradigm in reeder</h2>\n<p>Recently, I installed the new version of <a href=\"https://reeder.app\">Reeder</a>, and it introduced a completely different paradigm. Instead of the traditional folder system with unread counts, the new Reeder presents a more fluid experience. It&rsquo;s like a river of information flowing by, where articles and updates come and go. This new approach also allows for the integration of social media feeds, particularly from platforms like Mastodon and Micro.blog, all in one seamless stream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-continuous-reading-experience\">A continuous reading experience</h2>\n<p>One of the features I appreciate the most is that the app remembers where I left off.

				"content_text": "For years, I've been a loyal user of the Reeder app to keep up with my favorite feeds. The classic version, as it's now called, has been my go-to tool for organizing and reading articles. I meticulously sorted everything into folders and made it a daily ritual to check for new content, whether in the morning or sometimes even in the afternoon. It was my way of staying updated on the topics that interest me.\n\n## A new paradigm in reeder\n\nRecently, I installed the new version of [Reeder](https://reeder.app), and it introduced a completely different paradigm. Instead of the traditional folder system with unread counts, the new Reeder presents a more fluid experience. It's like a river of information flowing by, where articles and updates come and go. This new approach also allows for the integration of social media feeds, particularly from platforms like Mastodon and Micro.blog, all in one seamless stream.\n\n## A continuous reading experience\n\nOne of the features I appreciate the most is that the app remembers where I left off. When I open Reeder, it picks up right where I was, allowing me to continue reading without missing a beat. I can easily scroll through the feed, quickly skimming through articles, and only diving deeper into the ones that catch my interest.

First, my father was incredibly handy. He could do almost anything around the house, and he still can. Because he never really needed my help, he did everything while I watched. I never learned how to do things myself.</p>\n<p>During my education, while I still lived at home, I didn’t engage in much technical work either. I spent more time on the computer and doing administrative tasks, which I’m quite good at. But when it comes to DIY projects, that’s not my forte. I saw my father do it, but since I never really helped—beyond holding things and fetching tools—I never learned the skills.\nNow that we have our own home, there are occasional projects to tackle. However, I often run into problems because my skills and knowledge don’t match the level I want to achieve. When I want to fix or improve something, I have a vision of the outcome, but I’m not technically skilled enough to reach that outcome. It’s a matter of practice, but since our house is generally in good shape, there aren’t many opportunities to practice. This creates a vicious cycle: I don’t do many projects, so I don’t learn, and because I don’t learn, I’m hesitant to start new projects.</p>\n<p>For example, when painting needs to be done, we prefer to hire someone because the result is much better than if we did it ourselves. The same goes for replacing the shower, which we had done recently. I wouldn’t know where to start, and researching it would take a lot of time. Instead, we pay someone to do it. After all, how often in your life do you replace a shower or work on plumbing? Maybe once or twice, three times at most. It’s not a good investment of my time.</p>\n<p>There are, however, some things I can do. Recently, I replaced a light switch. It was a simple task, or so I thought. The new switch was a different model, so what I expected to be a straightforward job turned into a few hours of research. But in the end, it worked out perfectly. I completed a small project and felt good about it. When I can do a project and achieve the level of quality I want, I’m very satisfied.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This got me thinking about the types of projects I can do well. I’ll focus on those and continue to hire professionals for the rest. It’s not worth investing time and energy into something I don’t enjoy and that frustrates me when I can’t achieve a high standard. The quality of the work matters, and if I can’t meet that standard, it’s better to let someone else handle it.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while I may not be the handiest person around, I’ve learned to recognize my limits and focus on what I can do well. For the rest, I’m happy to hire professionals. It’s a balance between knowing when to DIY and when to call in the experts.

How is this different from other similar cars, dishes or conversations? What is its essence? Don’t assume that you already know what these things are all about, or that even if you knew them, they wouldn’t matter anyway. Experience this one thing for what it is, not what you think it is. Be open to what the world is telling you.

Nevertheless, the findings suggest that a four-day workweek could be a viable option for companies looking to improve employee well-being without significant negative impacts on productivity.\n\n## Related:\n* [The optimal amount of free time seems to be between 2 and 4 hours per day](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/16/free-time.html)\n* [Our go-to approach for problem-solving is to incorporate something new, rather than eliminate something existing](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/10/substraction-neglect.html)\n* [Professionals spend about 60% of their time on work about work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/12/15/work-about-work.html)\n* [Large organizations extinguish employees' passion](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/large-organisations-kill.html)\n* [The expectation that you check email outside of working hours can lead to health problems, relationship issues, and anxiety](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/11/15/boundaries.html)\n* [Hard work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/08/31/173746.html)\n",

Therefore, it is important not only to do things outside of work that make you happy but also to choose a career that matches your interests.\n\n## Related:\n* [Spend at least 2 hours per week in nature](https://jeroensangers.com/2024/08/09/spend-at-least.html)\n* [Take the time to think about, dream of, and look forward to future activities](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/dedicate-time-to.html)\n* [More money will make you happier](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/08/01/get-rich.html)\n* [Motivation](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/30/convince-yourself-that.html)\n* [Time to flow](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/21/try-to-get.html)\n* [Social values](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/07/social-values.html)\n* [Prevacation](https://jeroensangers.com/2024/01/24/prevacation.html)\n",

And to properly mix music, I will have to learn several new skills (I don’t play any instrument myself and can’t sing), most of which will probably be useless for podcast editing.\n\nBut I feel that I will also find things that could improve my podcast editing.\n\nSi this is the plan: once a month I will mix a song and post the before and after tracks here on my site.\n\nNext step: find an interesting song in multitrack format to download.\n",

Additionally, planning these blocks can help you structure your workday better and use your energy more efficiently.\n\n## Related:\n* [Before you start (a task, a work session, a project…), set a time budget](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/10/20/be-fore-you.html)\n* [Creative tasks are best done while low on energy](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/24/creative-tasks-are.html)\n* [Work cycle](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/work-cycle.html)\n* [Time to flow](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/21/try-to-get.html)\n* [Responsiveness](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/01/19/responsiveness.html)\n* [Morning productivity](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/24/morning-productivity.html)\n* [Time buckets](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/27/time-buckets.html)\n",

We tend not to prioritize them. We tend to think that to get together there has to be a reason involved. We have to have an event or some purpose to it. A run or a round of golf. Making a batch of beer or building a deck. Or we need to get the families together, let our partners talk and kids play. Dinner or a barbecue. Often, we guys never seem to think of getting together “just because”. For no reason at all other than to connect. Have a chit chat about anything under the sun. Or, sit in silence together and just be.\n<footer>Patrick Rhone<cite> <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/thinking-about-friendships/\">https://www.patrickrhone.net/thinking-about-friendships/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote><script note=\"\" src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n",

I asked my father for his phone and proceeded to purchase the keyboard app. Of course, my father never purchased any app, so I had to set up a payment method for his account. Apple offers several options here:</p>\n<p>First there is the credit card/debit card. My father does not have a credit card, but does have a credit card.

				"content_html": "<p>It is important to determine in advance when you want to stop a task, work session or project. This helps you stay focused and efficient. By setting a clear stop moment, you prevent yourself from overworking. If you know in advance when you want to stop, you can plan and prioritize better. This leads to more productivity and less stress. In addition, you prevent yourself from taking on too much work, which often happens when people are too optimistic about what they can do in a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p>An important part of this approach is using time as a way to measure attention. Attention is limited and difficult to measure, but time is easy to measure. By using time as a benchmark, you can organize your work better. This idea is in line with Parkinson&rsquo;s law, which states that work takes up the time available for it. By setting a clear end time, you force yourself to work more efficiently and prevent tasks from taking longer than necessary. This also helps to reduce indecision, as you spend less time constantly re-planning and prioritizing.</p>\n<p>Finally, by scheduling a stop moment, you can better deal with interruptions and unexpected events. This helps you find a balance between work and rest, which is important for long-term productivity and well-being. It is a simple but effective way to organize your work day and ensure that you achieve your goals without overworking yourself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"related\">Related:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/avoid-excessive-task.html\">Avoid excessive task switching to increase efficiency</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/link-desired-behaviour.html\">Link the desired behavior to a clear signal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/20/block-two-hours.html\">Schedule two hours every day for important work that doesn&rsquo;t need to be completed immediately; this helps you become happier and more productive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/03/spent-a-little.html\">Spend a little attention on planning and organizing your tasks, but not more than necessary; then, get to work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/03/spent-a-little.html\">Spend a little attention on planning and organizing your tasks, but not more than necessary; then, get to work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/during-the-mornings.html\">Work cycle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2021/12/18/interruptions-arent-intrinsically.html\">Interruptions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/21/try-to-get.html\">Time to flow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/10/reduce-mobile-phone.html\">Less mobile</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2022/07/25/a-little-bit.html\">Attention residue</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

In addition, you prevent yourself from taking on too much work, which often happens when people are too optimistic about what they can do in a certain amount of time.\n\nAn important part of this approach is using time as a way to measure attention. Attention is limited and difficult to measure, but time is easy to measure. By using time as a benchmark, you can organize your work better. This idea is in line with Parkinson's law, which states that work takes up the time available for it. By setting a clear end time, you force yourself to work more efficiently and prevent tasks from taking longer than necessary. This also helps to reduce indecision, as you spend less time constantly re-planning and prioritizing.\n\nFinally, by scheduling a stop moment, you can better deal with interruptions and unexpected events. This helps you find a balance between work and rest, which is important for long-term productivity and well-being. It is a simple but effective way to organize your work day and ensure that you achieve your goals without overworking yourself.\n\n## Related:\n* [Avoid excessive task switching to increase efficiency](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/avoid-excessive-task.html)\n* [Link the desired behavior to a clear signal](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/link-desired-behaviour.html)\n* [Schedule two hours every day for important work that doesn't need to be completed immediately; this helps you become happier and more productive](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/20/block-two-hours.html)\n* [Spend a little attention on planning and organizing your tasks, but not more than necessary; then, get to work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/03/spent-a-little.html)\n* [Spend a little attention on planning and organizing your tasks, but not more than necessary; then, get to work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/03/spent-a-little.html)\n* [Work cycle](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/during-the-mornings.html)\n* [Interruptions](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/12/18/interruptions-arent-intrinsically.html)\n* [Time to flow](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/21/try-to-get.html)\n* [Less mobile](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/10/reduce-mobile-phone.html)\n* [Attention residue](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/07/25/a-little-bit.html)\n",

The purple heather fields in the Netherlands are a dream for any landscape photographer. Combine them with mist and you’ve got yourself a dreamscape that looks like it popped straight out of a fairytale.\n<footer>Albert Dros<cite> <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/57288925/A-Purple-Dream\">https://www.behance.net/gallery/57288925/A-Purple-Dream</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote><script note=\"\" src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n",

Beaudoin\" cite=\"https://pdfpen.com/pdfpen/entry/productivity-experts-interview-with-luc-p-beaudoin/\">\nInfluencers make us feel that productivity is important, and yet they rarely define the term, let alone helpfully. For example, David Allen’s Getting Things Done (GTD) book, which became very popular in software circles, uses the term productivity very loosely. Many of the core examples in the GTD method relate to general activities such as cleaning one’s garage as opposed to working with knowledge. And the GTD principles have no reference to cognitive science, even though cognitive science is the modern interdisciplinary science of understanding the information processing we do in our brains, with or without the aid of technology.\n<footer>Luc P.

Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url's, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.\n\nAnother false believe about URL shorteners is that it's the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet.

When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you're linking to if you don't use an external shortener -- and therefore just Twitter's service.

I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code>\n\nI prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href=\"http://bitly.com/\">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.\n\nI decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks.

I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named 'TestShortener' to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field 'ad content' as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th>Visits</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <tfoot>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total</td>\n      <td>820</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tfoot>\n</table>\n\nClearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample's success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.\n\nIn order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.

Especially the latter gave rise to many discussions on the support forums about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->data density of the new design<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Eventually, the Omni Group <!-- raw HTML omitted -->published a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hack<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to change the layout of the task list back to a table of tasks more similar to Omnifocus 1.</p>\n<p>This made me wonder what other &lsquo;secret&rsquo; configuration options exist. So far, I have been able to compile the following list.</p>\n<p>All configuration options are activated by opening a special URL starting with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in your browser, which opens Omnifocus and applies the configuration. The URLs in the list are clickable to apply the configuration directly form this post.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to switch to the compact layout, which only uses one line per task.  Note that this layout is experimental and still has some issues. To return to the default layout you can use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The alternative layout looks like this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in a perspective grouped by context, you&rsquo;ll see that empty perspectives will also show up in the main outline, to mike it easier to reassign tasks by dragging them to another context. If you would rather not see them, you can remove the empty contexts from the main outline with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can also pass the parameter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->true<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to reactivate the empty contexts.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you put a project on hold, it&rsquo;s tasks will still show up in the forecast view. The reasoning is that even though the project is on hold, its tasks still have a due date. If you prefer not to see those tasks on the forecast view, disable them using <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to restore the default setting.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This &lsquo;hack&rsquo; is a little bit more complicated. The issue was that the order of the perspectives in the sidebar could not be reorganised. Note that in the final release the default perspectives behave just like any other perspective, and can be organised in any way you like it. However, if you want to freak out with URL schemes, this is the way:</p>\n<p>The default perspectives are on top (Inbox, Projects, Contexts&hellip;), followed by any starred perspectives. To add another perspective, you first have to star the perspective and open the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get a list of the current tabs. Note the ID of the starred perspective, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hdDT8UyDkVe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in this case:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Once you know the ID of your custom perspective, you can define the order of the tabs with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Whenever you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clip<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something from another application, the Quick Entry window shows up so you can specify some further meta-information about the task &ndash; project, context, dates&hellip; &ndash; and change the task description. If you would rather send the clipped information directly to the Omnifocus inbox, use the configuration URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There are two setting for configuring the synchronisation interval. First, you can set the maximum sync time &ndash;in seconds &ndash; with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (this sets the maximum to 10 minutes). Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to restore the default setting of one hour.</p>\n<p>The other option is for setting how long after making an edit Omnifocus should synchronise. The URL is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get back to the default setting of one minute.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you have setup your mac to use the &lsquo;Graphite&rsquo; appearance instead of the default &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; theme, Omnifocus will have black and white icons in the toolbar instead of the modern coloured icons. If you prefer this to be different, you can use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to force the use of coloured buttons or <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get the black and white icons in the toolbar. As usual, with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> you&rsquo;ll go back to the default setting.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This option was contributed by Colter in the comments of this post. When in Forecast view, you can drag a task to another date in the calendar to change its due date. You can change the defer date instead by holding the ⌘ key. If you would like to change the defer date by default, you can use the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you&rsquo;re using folders, OmniFocus will show the complete path in the project selection drop-down list using a colon as the hierarchy separation character, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personal : Finance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can configure the character used to separate the project hierarchy with the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-setting?OFMNamedObjectHierarchicalNameSeparator=%20:%20<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->%20<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the code for a space).</p>\n<p>Please leave a comment if you know of any other configuration option for Omnifocus 2; I will keep this post up-to-date.</p>\n",

The URLs in the list are clickable to apply the configuration directly form this post.\n\n<h3>Alternate layout</h3>\n\nUse <a href=\"///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact</code></a> to switch to the compact layout, which only uses one line per task.  Note that this layout is experimental and still has some issues. To return to the default layout you can use <a href=\"///change-preference?ContentLayout\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout</code></a>. The alternative layout looks like this:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/f8c1ad875e.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"95\" alt=\"Alternative layout for Omnifocus\" />\n\n<h3>Hide empty contexts in the main outline</h3>\n\nIf you're in a perspective grouped by context, you'll see that empty perspectives will also show up in the main outline, to mike it easier to reassign tasks by dragging them to another context. If you would rather not see them, you can remove the empty contexts from the main outline with <a href=\"///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false</code></a>. You can also pass the parameter <code>true</code> to reactivate the empty contexts.\n\n<h3>Hide On Hold projects in forecast view</h3>\n\nIf you put a project on hold, it's tasks will still show up in the forecast view. The reasoning is that even though the project is on hold, its tasks still have a due date. If you prefer not to see those tasks on the forecast view, disable them using <a href=\"///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false</code></a>. Use <a href=\"///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold</code></a> to restore the default setting.\n\n<h3>Reorganise the side bar</h3>\n\nThis 'hack' is a little bit more complicated. The issue was that the order of the perspectives in the sidebar could not be reorganised. Note that in the final release the default perspectives behave just like any other perspective, and can be organised in any way you like it. However, if you want to freak out with URL schemes, this is the way:\n\nThe default perspectives are on top (Inbox, Projects, Contexts...), followed by any starred perspectives. To add another perspective, you first have to star the perspective and open the URL <a href=\"///change-preference?SidebarTabs\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs</code></a> to get a list of the current tabs. Note the ID of the starred perspective, <code>hdDT8UyDkVe</code> in this case:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/2935404eb4.png\" width=\"534\" height=\"452\" alt=\"\" />\n\nOnce you know the ID of your custom perspective, you can define the order of the tabs with <a href=\"///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)</code></a>\n\n<h3>Send clippings directly to the inbox</h3>\n\nWhenever you <em>clip</em> something from another application, the Quick Entry window shows up so you can specify some further meta-information about the task -- project, context, dates... -- and change the task description. If you would rather send the clipped information directly to the Omnifocus inbox, use the configuration URL <a href=\"///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false</code></a>.\n\n<h3>Sync settings</h3>\n\nThere are two setting for configuring the synchronisation interval. First, you can set the maximum sync time --in seconds -- with <a href=\"///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600</code></a> (this sets the maximum to 10 minutes). Use <a href=\"///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync</code></a> to restore the default setting of one hour.\n\nThe other option is for setting how long after making an edit Omnifocus should synchronise. The URL is <a href=\"///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15</code></a> and <a href=\"///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync</code></a> to get back to the default setting of one minute.\n\n<h3>Toolbar colour</h3>\n\nIf you have setup your mac to use the 'Graphite' appearance instead of the default 'Blue' theme, Omnifocus will have black and white icons in the toolbar instead of the modern coloured icons. If you prefer this to be different, you can use <a href=\"///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua</code></a> to force the use of coloured buttons or <a href=\"///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite</code></a> to get the black and white icons in the toolbar. As usual, with <a href=\"///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint</code></a> you'll go back to the default setting.\n\n<h3>Set defer date when dragging a task in Forecast view</h3>\n\nThis option was contributed by Colter in the comments of this post. When in Forecast view, you can drag a task to another date in the calendar to change its due date. You can change the defer date instead by holding the ⌘ key. If you would like to change the defer date by default, you can use the URL <a href=\"///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true\"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true</code></a>.\n\n<h3>Change the project hierarchy separator character</h3>\n\nIf you're using folders, OmniFocus will show the complete path in the project selection drop-down list using a colon as the hierarchy separation character, e.g. <code>Personal : Finance</code>. You can configure the character used to separate the project hierarchy with the URL <a href=\"%20\"><code>omnifocus:///change-setting?OFMNamedObjectHierarchicalNameSeparator=%20:%20</code></a> (note that <code>%20</code> is the code for a space).\n\nPlease leave a comment if you know of any other configuration option for Omnifocus 2; I will keep this post up-to-date.\n",

There are some situations where we work in applications without having any idea of the underlying file- or database structure. E-mail is one of the uses of this system.\n\nLike I said, the mobile revolution is changing this again. Mobile operating systems as iOS, Symbian and Android give very limited access to the file system and force us back to the mainframe era. Even the <em>desktop</em> operating systems don't give you direct access to the file system anymore, but rather a virtual system mounted on top of the real file system.\n\nIt looks like file system abstraction is the future, but I don't think that applications will be the centre of our universe. The operating system of the future won't be centred on files or applications, but will use processes and tasks as the leading parameter.\n\nIn the operating system of the future, you will be able to say that you want to write, and a simple text editor will open. The moment you access more advanced editing functions, the application will automatically switch to another editing engine. Of course, you text is automatically saved and can be used in many ways.\n\nIn the future, operating systems will actually help you being productive. Trust me.\n",

Ni un cierre sin sentencia.

Con Internet y los sucesivos avances tecnológicos se ha democratizado extraordinariamente la creación y emisión de contenidos de todo tipo, que ya no provienen prevalentemente de las industrias culturales tradicionales, sino de multitud de fuentes diferentes.</li>\n    <li><strong>Los autores, como todos los trabajadores, tienen derecho a vivir de su trabajo con nuevas ideas creativas</strong>, modelos de negocio y actividades asociadas a sus creaciones. Intentar sostener con cambios legislativos a una industria obsoleta que no sabe adaptarse a este nuevo entorno no es ni justo ni realista.

No es de recibo que se realicen cambios legislativos que afectan a derechos fundamentales en una ley no orgánica y que versa sobre otra materia.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<em>NOTA: Este manifiesto fue redactado conjuntamente por periodistas, bloggers e internautas.

El Canasto quickly took the lead in the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong> category, and maintained the first position until the end of the voting period.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow the jury will be announced, and they have until Friday to choose among the top three of each category, which means that I have about 33% chance of winning the price.</p>\n<p>What makes me even more proud is that El Canasto ended at the 10th position on the list of most voted blogs, which in my opinion is really good for a blog in a not so mainstream niche.</p>\n<p>The final winners will be announced this Saturday in Seville, and of course I am going to be there to see whether I won the price and to meet a lot of other bloggers.

When I came to live in Spain, I was used to drive all day with the lights of my car turned on for better visibility.</p>\n<p>However, the people over here do not have that custom, and friendly as they are, they tried to warn me to tell that I forgot to turn off my lights. That is nice if it happens a few times, but actually it happened several times a day, and after a week I was getting quite fed-up with it. So I stopped driving with the lights turned on during daytime.</p>\n<p>This week, the Spanish government started a campaign to tell people about the enhanced security when driving with the car lights turned on. Guess who is happily driving around with the lights on again?</p>\n",

But now that I start writing I realise that I am by far the right person for writing on this topic. Right now I am sitting in my own house behind my €1400 Macbook with a high speed broadband internet connection. What am I supposed to know about poverty? I (and all my readers as well) probably belong to the richest 1% of the world.</p>\n<p>For me poverty is something they show on TV. Only once in a while I see poor people begging for money on the street, and I know that I can ignore them because I happen to live in a country with excellent social services that will take care of these people. For my own conscience, I make my contributions to some NGO's to pay of my guilt debt. When I read back these lines, it sounds very cold, which is not how I am, but there is a great deal of truth in it.</p>\n<p>Only twice in my life I actually saw poverty with my own eyes, when I visited Lesotho and Thailand, and it greatly affected me. More than that, it made me realise how lucky I am. We dedicate about 2% of our income to charity, which is an amount we won't even miss, but which makes a great difference for the people depending on it.</p>\n<p>I encourage everybody reading this to do the same: realise how lucky and incredibly rich you are, and donate 1-2% of your income. Together we can stop poverty.</p>\n",

I will also incorporate some other things such as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/JeroenSangers\">Twitter</a> steams etc. in the blog design.\n\nBe prepared for changes, Brain Tags is alive!\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I am multi-lingual: born Dutch, living in Spain and speaking English for most part of the working day.</p>\n<p>In the past it was easy to choose the language to use: Dutch, unless the other person doesn't speak Dutch, in which case I spoke English. I also choose English as my preferred language for everything related with IT, as more software and documentation is available in English, and because of the horrible translations in the first Dutch operating systems.</p>\n<p>When I moved to Spain, I only knew a little bit of Spanish, so I decided to dive into it, and convert my whole life to Spanish. I wrote my own personal notes in Spanish, my PCs had the Spanish version of Windows, my to-do lists and calendar were in Spanish, and little by little my Spanish improved.</p>\n<p>Now that I have lived here for a little bit more than six years, doing everything in Spanish started to feel a little bit forced. A few months back I changed the language of my mobile phone to English, and suddenly I realized that it is indeed possible to fit the texts on the tiny screen. My phone instantly became easier to use.</p>\n<p>Then I got a new laptop. Though initially and by habit installed in Spanish, I felt more at home when I changed it into English (fortunately, in Mac OS X the operating system language is a user preference, so I didn't need to reinstall). And since the tools I worked with are in English, I also enter the data (to-do items, appointments, etc.) in English.</p>\n<p>For each aspect of my life, I choose whether it is best to do in Dutch, English or Spanish. For example, whenever I am writing on El Canasto, I prefer that everything is in Spanish in order not to lose any time translating. Therefore, my brainstorming, saved text fragments and Movable Type are in Spanish. I also found that even though I am fully trilingual, you can't beat 37 years of experience in a language. Deeper thinking and difficult tasks are thus easier to do in Dutch.</p>\n<p>You see: each language has its place.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This year's topic is the environment.</em></p>\n<p>Camping is my favourite holiday activity. In our tent I feel free and I feel at home as I use my own stuff and sleep in my own sack. Furthermore, it is very easy for a shy person like me to have contact with others on a camping. I feel a lot more comfortable on a camping than in hotel and apartments.</p>\n<p>However, lately I noticed a trend of people camping more and more luxury: huge caravans with satellite television, microwave ovens, washing machine, skottelbraai, and even a motor to move around on the camping. While I like some comfort, one of the things I like about camping is its simpleness: less things around you means less cleaning and less worrying and thus more relaxing. And it still is possible:</p>\n<p>When I still lived in the Netherlands, I was a member of the <a href=\"http://kampeerclub.nl/\">NTKC</a>, a club of people who love camping in a simple and quiet way. The NTKC owns 22 campings in natural areas, and all the maintenance and administration is done by club members. On the NTKC terrains, people camp with tents up to 1.90 meters high and always in natural colours. When staying for a longer period, members move their tent to prevent dead grass.</p>\n<p>Most of the time there is plenty of room on the campings; in spring and autumn it might happen that you won't see anybody else from your tent!</p>\n<p>For me, being in the middle of nature is a very relaxing experience. If you live in the Netherlands and enjoy camping and nature, be sure to check out the NTKC. There are similar organisations elsewhere, such as the <a href=\"http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/\">Camping and Caravanning&nbsp; Club</a> in the U.K..</p>\n",

Some days ago I looked at some teenagers and noticed that all of them were listening to a MP3 player, but none of them had an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPod-Nano-Video-Silver%2Fdp%2FB000JO7PIM&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\">iPod</a>.</p>\n<p>As the iPod is certainly the hippest and easiest to use MP3 player on the market, I assumed that at least some teenagers would have one, while others would settle for a cheaper model. The iPods is indeed more expensive than other players, but usually pricing is not that big problem for teenagers if the device is cool enough.</p>\n<p>I decided to ask a teacher who also owns an iPod about his view on the subject, and he gave me a very simple explanation.</p>\n<p><strong>The iPod is anti-social</strong>.</p>\n<p>For teenagers, gadgets only have one function: communicating and sharing with friends. The first thing they do after downloading a song from internet is share it with their friends. And well, the iPod simply won't let them do that.</p>\n<p>Songs on the iPod are locked up and are only accessible from iTunes on the original PC. Furthermore, to connect an iPod to a PC you need a cable and there is no way a teenagers is going to walk around with an un-sexy USB cable.</p>\n<p>A for teenagers successful MP3 player has an incorporated USB port (usually hidden under a cap) so they can connect it easily to any PC (at school, at their friend's home,...) and it should simply work like a memory stick with the MP3 files accessible from the operating system for easy copying of files.</p>\n<p>As you know, I am not a very social person, and therefore I am perfectly happy without an iPod.</p>\n",

Many people I speak to have only one dream: becoming a civil servant. Unlike most other modern countries, in Spain civil servants earn way more that people working in companies. Add to that some very good secondary labour conditions and a <strong>contract for life</strong> without performance objectives, and you can understand why most people working for companies envy those others.</p>\n<p>Just an example: most teachers earn about 25% more than I do (and my wage is higher than the average company worker). For that money, they work 18–22 hours a week at the school, plus some hours at home for preparation and revision of exams, while I work 8,5 hours a day, five days a week. Furthermore, while I have four weeks of holidays, they get two whole months in summer, two weeks at christmas and another week at eastern!</p>\n<p>Other civil servants might not have such a long holidays as the teachers, but they do enjoy other benefits. Knowing all this, I am still surprised whenever I see the huge economical growth Spain is making with such a big and inefficient civil overhead.</p>\n",

It did sort them, but did not recognise the date format used in some feeds, starting with the weekday (Mon – Sun). Therefore, my writings made on Wednesdays ended up at the end of the list;</li>\n<li>As there still are relatively few Pipes, it is easy to game the listing, which is sorted by the number of times a Pipe has been run. I simply clicked a few time on the <em>Run this Pipe</em> link, and little by little moved upwards in the list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Two minutes more clicking, and my <em>Brain Network</em> pipe ended up halfway on the second page, in front of some way more interesting feeds.

My plan is to maintain a higher posting frequency than on this blog or the <a href=\"http://pos.braintags.com/\">Wizard of POS</a> as I have much material and a lot of ideas for this blog.\n\nFor now I would like all my readers to have a look at <a href=\"http://canasto.es/\">El Canasto</a>.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/e7f9c0e478.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"119\" alt=\"El Canasto\" />\n",

Are the 20% that purchase the most the same customers that use most of your organization&rsquo;s resources? Well, experience tells us that this is not the case: there usually are customers buying for huge amounts without ever needing the support department. The two Pareto principle are not correlated, so if we only look at the small group of customers responsible for 80% of the sales, you will find once again that 20% of that group is using 80% of the resources.</p>\n<p>As there is no correlation, I can easily divide my customers into four distinct groups:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I put those four groups in a specific order.

Of course not, as we are talking about a principle and not a fixed categorization. If you drop group four, and look again at the numbers, you will see that once again 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales and 80% of the resources are used by only 20% of the clients. Customers who were in to top 20% before, not rank lower simple because you have less customers. If I have 100 clients, there are 20 clients in the top 20%, but if I drop 50 of them, the top 20% will be formed by only 10 customers. Of course, if you have to drop customers, because you haven&rsquo;t got enough resources, make sure you drop clients from the fourth group, as the clients in the other three groups are worth more.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/65c4093238.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"246\" alt=\"Network\" />\n\n<p>More and more bloggers unite in so-called blogging networks. Robert Scoble published a good overview of the most important networks in <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/\">Competitors of PodTech that I love, er, going to the Content Mall</a>. A content mall is the same as a blogging network.</p>\n<p>As I am interested in blogging in general, I have been following various blogging networks for some time. I can clearly see the benefits of blogging networks for the bloggers involved, but have been wondering for a long time what the benefit is for the visitors of a site part of a blogging network. So I posted the following <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164130\">comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is clear that 'content malls' bring in huge benefits for the sites within a mall. They can work together and link to each other to boost PR.</p>\n<p>But what benefit is there for the visitors? Shopping malls bring benefit by sharing a physical space with various stores. After going shopping for clothes I can buy some electronics without having to drive to another place. Very comfortable.</p>\n<p>But when visiting a fashion weblog part of a content mall I can go to the technology weblog of that mall just as fast as I can go to any other techblog. I won't visit the technology weblog because it belongs to a certain group, but rather because I like it in spite of being part of that group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164224\">Answered</a> promptly by Robert self:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By joining a network a blogger/podcaster/videoblogger will probably be able to get paid much more than if he/she tries to do it on his/her own.</p>\n<p>That money might let them quit their jobs (that's what happened to <a href=\"http://GeekBrief.TV\">GeekBrief.TV</a>, for instance) which will enable that person to produce even more content for you. Or, maybe, afford better equipment. Or, maybe be able to afford a trip to more industry conferences where they'll be able to bring you more news and information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Robert completely hits the nail on its head here. What is good for the blogger is good for his/her reader.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<blockquote><strong>Personal finance</strong> is the application of the principles of finance to the monetary decisions of an individual or family unit.\n\n</blockquote>\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with personal finance. Ever since I have a computer I have been trying to get a grip on finances, with changing results.\n\n<h2>The excel days</h2>\n\nMy first attempt used the example Excel sheet created by the <abbr title=\"Nationaal Instituut voor Budgetvoorlichting\">Nibud</abbr> that came with Microsoft Excel. It was a nice and clever Excel sheet, but still living with my parents I only used part of it. After a while I stopped entering my receipts, and out went the Excel sheet.\n\n<h2>Hacking in Access</h2>\n\nA little bit later I started playing with Microsoft Access. Access also comes with a financial example file, and I modified and tweaked it to fit my needs. But after all the hacking, all left to be done was entering receipts and numbers, which is a boring job. I guess I still didn't need personal finance, as I left the database alone after some months.\n\n<h2>Banking software</h2>\n\nSome time later, a new phenomenon showed up: internet banking. My bank sent me some diskettes with an application that was able to import bank statements. Now that was easy! At first I tried to manage cash money with that application as well, but soon left that again. Internet banking was a success, as I have managed my bank accounts through that application until I could access my accounts through web pages. When later I started buying and selling stocks and stock options I could do that from the same application. That little application gave an overview of my bank accounts, but I still haven't been able to see where the money was going…\n\n<h2>Back to basics</h2>\n\nThe situation complicated when I started living together. I was not dealing with my money anymore, it was <em>our</em> money. After some months the question came up: \"Where does our money go?\" We talked about it, and decided to implement a low-tech financial planning solution: pen & paper. This worked great for some months, until we had more or less a picture of our expenses. Exit pen & paper.\n\n<h2>Excel round two</h2>\n\nLast year we were planning some big expenses, and I wanted to know whether these were justified, and how much time we would need to recover the invested money. Right about that time I read about an easy budgeting template in Excel, <a href=\"http://pearbudget.com/\">Pear Budget</a>.

				"content_text": "<p>After reading the lifehacker <a href=\"http://www.lifehacker.com/software/how-i-work/\">How I work</a> series, I thought that it might be interesting to write down my own way of working for the readers of Brain Tags.</p>\n<h2>What desktop software do you use every day?</h2>\n<p>As most people I have two sites from where I work: in the office I sell and support the products of <a href=\"http://www.ICG.es/\">ICG software</a>, and at home I run <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">BryteNet</a>, do some web development, blog and keep in contact with me friends all over the world. At both places I use a Windows XP desktop PC, equipped with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\">Firefox</a></strong> I use the Internet a lot, and have always have some tabs open with sites I want to read whenever I have a spare moment, e.g. when I am on hold. With Internet Explorer I would have my task bar cluttered with screens, but Firefox's tabs keep things organized.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.activewords.com/\">ActiveWords</a></strong> Whenever I have to work on a PC without ActiveWords I feel very clumsy. ActiveWords automatically corrects my typing errors, opens my applications, fills in texts and generally saves me a lot of time.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/\">Trillian</a></strong> With customers and friends all over the world I use instant messaging all the time. The problem is that everybody uses another application, and the different applications (MSN, ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Google Chat,…) do not talk together. Instead of installing a separate client for each protocol, I use Trillian, which 'speaks' all those protocols.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://skype.com/\">Skype</a></strong> Instead of sending messages, it is more efficient to actually talk to somebody. That is where Skype comes in, as I can talk with any other Skype user for free.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>In the office:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> We are a Microsoft shop, so obviously use Outlook. Most of my colleagues use it exclusively for e-mail, but I spend more time in the calendar and tasks. Of course I had to make some adjustments, as the Microsoft way of doing things does not always coincide with my own. So I installed <a href=\"http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/\">Outlook Quotefix</a> to stop Outlook from top-posting when I reply to messages and to trim the headers in my replies. Furthermore I use the <a href=\"http://gtdsupport.netcentrics.com/learn/\">Getting Things Done add-in</a> to streamline my workflow and the <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download&trk=ftr_ol\">LinkedIn toolbar</a> to create contacts directly from people's signatures and to keep them updated when contacts change their <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/sangers\">LinkedIn profile</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/desktopsearch/enterprise/default.mspx\">Windows Enterprise Desktop Search</a></strong> We have a lot of information scattered over a few places on several servers and of course on my own PC. Windows Desktop Search brings that all together, as I have it index all items in Outlook (mail, tasks, notes, contacts), and all documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML and PDF) on my PC and the servers. I use the enterprise edition as it has a much cleaner interface than the MSN edition.</li>\n<li><strong>ICG Software</strong> Of course we have our own applications installed. Not only for giving support, but also for invoicing and tracking customer activity (CRM).</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.unyte.net/\">Unyte</a></strong> Unyte is a free add-on for Skype that allows you to share an application on your PC with the person(s) on Skype. I use it to give demonstrations, training and support to our foreign customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>At home:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/\">Thunderbird</a></strong> My e-mail client of choice. It is fast and complete. Of course I use the IMAP protocol instead of POP3, so I always have all my important messages on the mail server to be accessed through webmail.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.palm.com/us/software/desktop/\">Palm Desktop</a></strong> At home I don't need an advanced planner, so this simple (and free!) calendar, task list and contact list fulfills all my needs.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/\">Ecto</a></strong> Blogging made easy. A real blogger does not write in small <code>textarea</code> fields, but uses a full blown desktop client.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.chami.com/html-kit/\">HTML-Kit</a></strong> I used to do my coding work in notepad, but noticed that I needed some more features. Since then I use HTML-Kit to do all my coding.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.rssbandit.org/\">RSS-Bandit</a></strong> To stay up-to-date with what is happening in the world I follow the writings on several web sites. Instead of visiting these sites every day, A read their feeds in RSS-Bandit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What web sites do you use every day?</h2>\n<p>Just in terms of raw weekly hours, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\">Google</a> is definitely number one. In addition to regular old searching, I use it for looking up definitions, as a calculator, and for checking stuff like maps and weather. I do love the Google.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I use <a href=\"http://getharvest.com/\">Harvest</a> to track my worked hours.</p>\n<p>All other sites enter in RSS-Bandit, which is my dashboard to the world. It shows me tech news, news about my friends, search results on topics I am interested in, comments made on my weblogs, replies to comments I have left on other blogs…</p>\n<h2>What PDA/personal organizer/system do you use to keep organized?</h2>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2004/07/palmone_zire_31/\">Palm Zire 31</a>, which I keep synchronized with my two workstations.

I know, I can't believe it either, but there's a safety card in the seat pocket in front of you. No one ever reads it, so I'm not going to even bother asking you to. At this time, you should have your seatbelts on, your tray tables up, and your seats in their upright and most uncomfortable position. This is a no complaining, no whining, no smoking flight. If you absolutely must smoke, I suggest you avail yourself of our smoking area out on the wing...that is, if you can manage to get it lit. While you're out there, feel free to enjoy our inflight movie, Gone With The Wind. We don't expect a loss of cabin pressure today. If we did, the three of us would have called in sick. But if we do lose pressure, masks will automatically fall from the ceiling. After you're done screaming, simply put the mask on and breath normally, like this: [Darth Vader Imitation]. Please put your own mask on before helping your children...or those who are acting like children, such as your husband. Now, since we've been cleared for take-off, I'd like to ask you to lean over and please press your face against the window so that all those other bankrupt airlines can see that we have a full flight.

It automatically organizes entries tagged with <code>listing</code> on the Edgeio site, and allows visitors to search and comment on listings. The concept sounds very interesting to me, so I decided to try it out.</p>\n<p>The only thing I have for sale at the moment are web server accounts, so I created three posts on the <a href=\"http://blog.brytenet.com/\">BryteNet blog</a> describing the three web hosting packages <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">BryteNet</a> currently offers. I tagged all posts with the keyword <code>listing</code> as well as some additional keywords. After that I signed up at Edgeio, claimed my blog and noticed that the posts were already appearing on the site, including a thumbnail made from the image I used in the post. Though they offer the possibility to encode the list price in the blog post as well, I had not mentioned the price, so I edited my Edgeio entries to list the corresponding price. Conclusion: it is very easy to get listed on Edgeio.</p>\n<p>After that I went to the customer side of Edgeio, to see how my listings would appear. One great feature of Edgeio is that you can enter your location, and it will filter the listings based on the distance you have chosen with an AJAX slider. I started by putting the slider on 'Lleida' to see only listings from my home town. As expected, there are only a handful of bloggers here, only my own listings showed up.</p>\n<p>I moved the slider up to 'Catalonia'. To my surprise, I found that only one other Catalan blogger uses Edgeio, offering jobs in Barcelona. There are quite some bloggers in Catalonia, but apparently none of them has found Edgeio yet. I continued to 'Spain' finding three more offers, bringing the total on an amazing eight!</p>\n<p>It is clear that Edgeio is not ready for prime time yet. Though it is easy to get listed, not many bloggers use the service, and therefore it is not worth the effort at this moment to search for listings on Edgeio.</p>\n",

Very neat! I still have to translate the FAQ section, which for the moment will show the default language, even if I request the Dutch view.</p>\n<p>When all has been translated into Dutch, I will add Spanish and Catalan too.

For the moment I have only made some small changes, and have concentrated myself on the actual contents of the site.\n\nToday I also created a Dutch version of the BryteNet site, which was done within 5 minutes! Now I am translating all content, which is done in a very clever way. A single object (text, folder, image,…) can have several translations, and depending on the way you access this object, one version or the other is shown. So going to http://brytenet.com gives me the default (English) view of the home page, while http://nl.brytenet.com will show me the Dutch view of the same object. Very neat! I still have to translate the FAQ section, which for the moment will show the default language, even if I request the Dutch view.\n\nWhen all has been translated into Dutch, I will add Spanish and Catalan too. And probably about the same time I will start tweaking my templates to change the components shown and the layout of the pages. The nicest job, making a unique design for this site, I will keep for the last, as it is the most logical order, and to have something to work to.\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/1be7092b0f.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"107\" alt=\"Brytenet\" />\n\n<p>The last weeks I have been very busy with the new <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">BryteNet</a> site. The old site had been created in a couple of minutes 'just to have something', and never changed afterwards. It was really time for a complete site overhaul. When planning the <a href=\"/2006/01/a_little_update/\">datacenter move</a>, I decided not to restore the old site, but to put a simple page with the main properties of the hosting packages and contact information instead. That gave me the chance to built the new site properly.</p>\n<h3>ClientExec</h3>\n<p>My first concern were the existing users of the server. I quickly installed <a href=\"http://www.clientexec.com/\">ClientExec</a> and created accounts for all users, so they can manage their helpdesk tickets and billing information. Installation was very easy, and within an hours I had everything set up. I still want to change the templates to fit in the new BryteNet style, but that can wait 'till later. I did modify the template to include the Google Analytics code. After all, I still want to know what is going on…</p>\n<h3>It's a Small Place</h3>\n<p>The next step was to restore the <a href=\"http://blog.brytenet.com/\">BryteNet weblog</a>. Since the new server has Fantastico installed, I only had to fill in some details, and WordPress was installed. I copied the plug-ins I used to the right place and restored the database to get the old content, and I was finished. 29 minutes was all I needed!</p>\n<h3>eZ Publish</h3>\n<p>For the rest of the site I had chosen the <a href=\"http://ez.no/\">eZ Publish</a> CMS. While eZ Publish is probably way too big for such a small site, I wanted to use it for its execllent multi-language support and since it can do literally anything. So I can manage all aspects of the site (product information, contact forms, customer forum,...) with a single tool. eZ Publish also has a weblog module, but for the moment I have chosen to stick with WordPress.<br>\nI had looked at eZ Publish before, and have big plans for it for future projects, but without a concrete implementation, it is difficult to find out what the possibilities and limitations of this CMS are.</p>\n<p>Installation was a breeze, and I have been able to activate the features I wanted to use at the moment. The templating system is very powerful, though I find it still difficult to find the right template when I want to change a part of a page-layout.</p>\n<p>A little disappointment was that eZ Publish is not able to generate friendly URI's when PHP is implemented as CGI rather than with mod_php. For security reasons PHP is run through CGI on the BryteNet servers, resulting in the appearance of <code>index.php?</code> in the middle of the URI. It is something I will have to live with…</p>\n<p>Another problem I still have to solve is that the automatically generated menus only contain folders, and I haven't found a way yet to include links outside eZ Publish in the menu. I have found something on the subject in the eZ forums, and will tackle this problem soon enough.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>The next big thing I am going to work on is to give BryteNet an unique face. At the moment the three components of the BryteNet site (eZ Publish, ClientExec and WorkPress) still use their default design, which I only modified a little bit. I om going to generate a completely new stylesheet for those sites, so they will have more or less the same look. I started my work with designing a new logo, and am now working on the colour scheme. I have some ideas on how the result will be, but am still experimenting with those ideas.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more news…</p>\n",

Fortunately, coming from another EU country I have the privilege to not really need it in daily life, so there was no problem. I can use my Dutch documentation for identify myself.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can't do is to buy expensive goods as a new car or a house. I had forgotten completely about these limitations, until we started <a href=\"/2005/06/car_hunting/\">looking for a new car</a> last summer. We did buy the car on MJ's name, but I decided to go for it again and hope that they would give me a longer lasting residence card. That was in August 2005:</p>\n<p><strong>August</strong><br>\nI started by obtaining the necessary papers and filling them in. I also tried to phone to the immigration office to get an appointment for delivering these papers. After two weeks, I got my appointment, which fortunately was after the business hours of my office.</p>\n<p><strong>September 8</strong><br>\nAfter leaving the office I went to the immigration office to deliver all papers I had prepared: a special form, copies of my passport, copies of my current, expired, residence card, copies of my last salary statement, an extract from my record in the town hall…</p>\n<p>Fortunately I had understood the cryptic instructions correctly, and all papers were in order. They told me that they were going to study my request, which was going to take them a full month!</p>\n<p><strong>November 9</strong><br>\nTime to find out whether they had approved my request. Unfortunately, this can't be done with an appointment, so you simply had to queue up at the immigration office. I told my boss that I was going to arrive late, and joined the queue two hours before the office was going to open. I only had about 20 people in front of me. I already knew from last time that I would have to spend the whole morning in the queue if I would not be there before they open their doors. After spending three hours on the street, and waiting 20 minutes more inside the office, I finally got a bunch of papers back; my request had been approved. I had to go to the bank to pay the administration costs and then to the police office to get my residence card. I payed directly, and decided to visit the police the next day, since the queue was too big already.</p>\n<p><strong>November 10</strong><br>\nI told my boss that I would arrive late again, and joined the queue 90 minutes before opening time; the queue at the police station is smaller. This time I only had 12 people in from of me. After waiting two hours on the street, I was allowed to enter to show the papers I received at the immigration office and place my signature and fingerprint on a special form so they can create my residence permit. They need one full month for doing this.</p>\n<p><strong>December 30</strong><br>\nBecause of the cold and the amount of work I had in December, I didn't go to pick up my residence permit until three weeks later. Once again I told my company that I would arrive late and once again I had to queue on the street, but this time only 45 minutes. Almost five months after filling in the forms I finally received a little card, which fortunately is valid until 2010.</p>\n<p>Renewing my residence permit has cost me €7, but most of all a lot of precious time. I spent about 6 hours waiting in queues on the street, 45 minutes in queues inside offices, and have been out of office during 3 hours. To me that sounds like I have wasted a lot of time for a simple administrative request. I mainly have been transporting papers from home to one office, and from one office to another; something which could easily have been done by mail. I know that I have to show up in person to get an identification document, but does this have to be for each and every step??? And why do they need a full month to check my history and approve my request and a full month to print out a little plastic credit-card sized pass???</p>\n<p>As most of you know, I hate paperwork.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Recently there has been a lot of attention for web statistics: first <a href=\"http://www.haveamint.com/\">Mint</a> was launched, introducing design and AJAX to web statistics. Soon after that, old-timer NedStat got bought by <a href=\"http://www.webstats4u.com/\">WebStats4U</a>, which lost most of its clients by adding unwanted advertising to sites using the NedStat counter. And last week Google re-launched <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analyitics/\">Google Analytics</a>, previously known as Urchin. There is a lot going on in a market just as old as the Internet.</p>\n<p>As long as people have created web pages, they have been interested in knowing who is visiting their pages. Most web statistics packages already exist for years, and the only changes they have made to their products are the inclusion of new browser detection and more advanced bot filtering. And the inclusion of RSS readers of course.</p>\n<p>The first statistics I ever used was the NedStat counter. I only had to place an image on my home page, and NedStat would tell me the referrer pages, countries, and browsers. Ver neat!</p>\n<p>Then I moved to another hosting provider, which gave me access to the server logs. I installed <a href=\"http://awstats.sourceforge.net/\">AWStats</a> and got <a href=\"/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com\">incredible statistics</a>. Now I can see which search bots spidered my site, which file types are more popular, and which files are missing (404 errors). It is all in the server logs!</p>\n<p>And now I am playing with <a href=\"http://google.com/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a>. Google's application does not use my server logs, but require me to add a piece of JavaScript to each page. The results are once again a step up from what I had: Google does not only show technical reports, but also has <em>views</em> for marketers and executives, showing things like ROI and tracking your <em>goals</em>.</p>\n<p>As a technology-oriented person, I first set the <em>webmaster view</em> as my default view. But Google's webmaster view gives me less information than AWStats. It does not tell me about 404 errors, it does not show me bandwidth numbers, it does not show me login names.… The other views in Analyze are great, and very useful when managing my sites, but I do miss webmaster information.</p>\n<p>I wish it would be possible to ‘enrich’ the data Google collects with my server log files, <a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com/\">FeedBurner </a> reports, etc. With <a href=\"http://google.com/base/\">Google Base</a> they laid the foundation for adding content, they only have to implement in into analyze.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/b1e6908e1e.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Google Analytics\" />\n",

Not only have they <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/?p=36\">stopped accepting new signups</a>, but they also don't allow existing users to add new website profiles.</p>\n<p>After the launch I managed to get signed up, and submitted one of my sites to evaluate Google Analytics. Today, about a week after my signup, Google Analytics finally shows me the results. And I like it a lot! So I want to add Google Analytics to my other sites.</p>\n<p>In the Website Profiles screen I read: <em>To track another website with Analytics, click the 'Add Website Profile' link</em>, but there is no such link in that screen. The help function directs me to the signup screen with the message that they do not accept new signups. What to do?</p>\n<p>I loaded the Website Profiles page in my favourite HTML editor, and find the following code:</p>\n\n<code>\n&lt;!--\n&lt;td class=\"list_control_cell\" align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"plus\"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=\"admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX\" class=\"normal\"&gt;Add Website Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n--&gt;\n</code>\n\n<p>They simply commented out the ‘Add Website Profile’ button! I open the page linked in the code, and Google adds my new website profile without any problem! So to add another website profile, you only have to log-in at Google Analytics and go to the following URL, replacing the XXXXXX by your own user number:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX\">https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX</a></p>\n",

Last week I described the <a title=\"Brain Tags: Feed reading lifecycle\" href=\"/archives/2005/11/feed_reading_lifecycle/\">five phases of feed reading</a> I had observed.

I found <a title=\"News in a Newspaper: Information Overload\" href=\"http://mybroadsheet.blogspot.com/2005/11/information-overload.html\">somebody agreeing</a> with this tabloid view. I also received this e-mail from <a href=\"http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/\">Robert Scoble</a>:\n\n<blockquote>That's interesting.\nI don't agree that that's phase five.\nWhy?

So I checked the manufacturer's web site top see where I could buy it. After phoning all possible shops in Lleida, I reverted to an on-line shop. I looked at the available options and choose the <a href=\"http://tecnologia.carrefour.es\" rel=\"nofollow\">biggest company</a>. That turned out to be my biggest mistake:</p>\n<p>On <strong>October 24</strong> I connected to their site, found my item and saw that they had it on stock. The site mentioned a delivery time of 7 days, which was fine, since I needed it in 14 days.</p>\n<p><strong>October 25</strong><br>\nI received an e-mail confirming my order, after one day!, and a request for a copy of my identification card. Of course I immediately sent this.</p>\n<p><strong>October 28</strong><br>\nI checked the order status on the web, since I had not received a confirmation of reception of my message. The status mentioned ‘missing information’, so I sent an e-mail asking for the current status.</p>\n<p><strong>October 31</strong><br>\nI still hadn't heard anything, and started to become a little bit nervous. So I phoned their customer support. They told me that there was a delay, and they were waiting for their supplier to deliver the goods. They could not explain me why the item was shown to be in stock when I made my order.</p>\n<p><strong>November 2</strong><br>\nI received an e-mail from them, telling me that there had been an ‘incident’. I phoned them and asked them whether they would be able to deliver the item on time, since I needed it in 6 days. They assured me that it would not be a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>November 3</strong><br>\nI would not let them forget me, so I phoned again. They told me that they had the item in their central warehouse, and that it was now passing quality control. They should be able to send it me in one week. I patiently explained them that I really need the item in a few days. The nice guy one the other side said that he understood me and that he would pass a message to the quality control department. I expected that it would be possible to ship it to me on the next day, but told me to phone again.</p>\n<p><strong>November 4</strong><br>\nI faithfully phoned again, hoping that they'd been able to send me my device. But instead of that, the nice lady tells me that they can not deliver within the next two weeks. Besides that, she tells me that there has not been noted anything about my phone call the day before! I explain once more that I really need the device, and that they'd promised me that it would be possible to deliver it on time, but she says that there is nothing she can do. I cancel my order…</p>\n<p>Only little time left, so all I can do is find a shop that has the device in stock and pick it up personally. I start with the big outlets in Barcelona, and after phoning 7 of them I am able to reserve my item. I hop in the car, drive 160 kilometres, pay some money —hé, this shop is even cheaper than what I found on Internet!— and drive home happily. I promise everybody that I won't buy anything from Carrefour!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Though RSS feeds are still only used by the ‘<em>lucky few</em>’, I discovered several phases of RSS reading behaviour:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>In <strong>phase 1</strong> you discover RSS. You are very enthusiastic about having the possibility to see all the news from your favourite resources in one place. When visiting a web site you first look for the orange XML or RSS icon to subscribe. People in phase 1 typically subscribe to 1-50 feeds. You feel very efficient, since all news automagically appears in your feed reader; you've saved yourself hours of useless browsing;</li>\n    <li>After a while you realize that there is a lot more out there: your 50 feeds are not even the top of the iceberg. You have entered <strong>phase 2</strong>. Once in while you find an interesting post outside your feeds, but since the rest of the posts from this author are about his cats you decided not to subscribe. Since you don't want to miss the good posts you set up some ‘search feeds’: <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/\">Technorati</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pubsub.com/\">PubSub</a>, <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com/\">Feedster</a>, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> and friends search the blogsphere for your interest, and automatically notify you. You spend hours tweaking your queries, since you don't want to miss anything. All feeds are nicely organized with a separate folder per subject. You are now checking over 100 feeds on a daily basis;</li>\n    <li>What started with 5 minutes every day, now cost you over an hour. And you can't skip a single day, since that will cost you two hours next day. <strong>Phase 3</strong> is hard work, with an ever increasing number of feeds to read. <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/30.html#a8331\">Robert Scoble mentioned reading 900+ feeds</a>! You know that something has to happen, so you start wielding out your feeds. You unsubscribe feeds of old contacts, feeds about subjects you are no longer interested in, feeds of dead sites… You also put a break on the new feeds you subscribe to. You create a '‘<em>probation</em>’ folder for new feeds, and selectively promote feeds to your main folders. Despite all these efforts you don't feel like you're in control: you are juggling instead;</li>\n    <li>Usually external influences force you into <strong>phase 4</strong>. You simply don't have the time anymore to spend hours a day reading. There are two ways to deal with phase 4: people who go the drastical way simply delete all their feeds, except for the 10 feeds that really matter. After all, if something really important happens everybody will write about it within a few hours. The trick is to pick out the relevant feeds publishing all the news you are interested in.\nOther people are more careful, and simply regroup their feeds by reading frequency: the 10 feeds to be read daily, about 50 feeds to be read once a week if you have time, and many feeds more just in case you want to read them on a bored Sunday afternoon. Reading is a pleasure again, and you feel in control knowing that you can't possibly read everything out there but won't miss any important news.</li>\n    <li>In <strong>phase 5</strong> you see the light! Imagine an army of professional editors searching all available news, and selecting the best pieces. Even better, they publish their results on a handy paper based format called tabloid, which you can take with you wherever you want. And finally, you will be interrupted only once a day.</li>\n</ol>\n\n[Insert fancy graph here]\n\nInspired by Jason Kottke, I entered phase 4 today. I regrouped all my feeds, and reduced the number of feeds in Bloglines. Furthermore I told Bloglines to notify me only when new items appear in my 'top' folder. The first result has been amazing. I had a busy day, so only read my top feeds. I still have a feeling of what is going on whithout having to spend a lot of time reading.\n",

The truth is that I am blogging just as much as always, but I spread my writings over several sites to prevent clutter.\n\nIf you are interested in my personal life and general writings about technology and travelling, Brain Tags is the place to be.\n\nAnd if you are interested in news and my opinion about the Point of Sale market, I give you the <a href=\"http://pos-wizard.com/\">POS Blog</a>.\n\nAnd now I have <a href=\"http://blog.brytenet.com/\">It's a small place</a>, giving you a view behind the curtains of a small part-time hosting company.\n\nI have started writing about what I did to set it all up, with todays article telling on how I got the idea to start a hosting business. Of course, Brain Tags readers already know <a href=\"http://braintags.com/archives/2005/06/dreaming/\">the answer</a>, but I included it for completeness.\n\n<em>It's a small place</em> is also the first site I created in WordPress. For the moment the set-up is very basic (I only changed the default templates) but you can expect some more tinkering in the coming weeks. So far I have been impressed by WordPress: the installation was peanuts, and there is plenty of functionality. The user interface is not as sleek as the Movable Type interface, but I value function over looks anyway.\n",

This encourages him to respond promptly to your needs, and it keeps you from waiting at the bar. A pre-tip is always at least 5 dollars (and more often 10 or above, depending on how crowded or upscale the bar is). Despite the amount, it should not comprise the whole of your tipping. One dollar for every 2 drinks afterward is typically sufficient to maintain their interest.\n\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat a huge bullshit!!!

				"content_html": "<p>Most computers have two input devices: a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse is mainly used to navigate in the GUI, while the keyboard is used to enter data.

As my work slowly shifts from technical support to marketing and sales, I find myself writing more texts. And the more I write, the more I feel limited by my two–finger technique. I write slow and make many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->mistakes. So I decided to use the mouse less and improve my typing skills, preferably using all ten fingers. I am aware that this is going to be very difficult, since old habits are hard to shake off and starting to write with ten fingers will initially decrease my typing speed even more, but I am convinced that I will be more efficient in the long term.</p>\n<p>I do not have time to do a special training, but would rather learn it be gradually changing my habits.

ActiveWords is a wonderful application in which you configure words to trigger events. To open the Firefox browser, I simply type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and my favourite browser starts. The trick for me is that ActiveWords lets me start applications faster by keyboard than by mouse, even if I use ten fingers to type. Another benefit of ActiveWords is that the Misspellings plug-in corrects my mistypings within any application! It works exactly like the auto correct feature of Microsoft Word, but is works system wide.
