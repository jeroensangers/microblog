				"content_html": "<p>As a <a href=\"https://kenso.es\">productivity expert</a>, I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for tools that can adapt to my ever-evolving workflow. This week, I decided to experiment with <a href=\"https://tana.inc\">Tana</a>, a system that has become my go-to for task and project management. What I love about Tana is its flexibility—it can be molded to fit any workflow, making it an indispensable tool in my productivity arsenal.</p>\n<p>Until recently, I organized my tasks using a Kanban system within Tana, categorizing them into three horizons: today&rsquo;s tasks, this week&rsquo;s tasks, and future tasks. This method worked well, but as someone who constantly seeks improvement, I wanted to try something new. Enter time-blocking—a technique I had previously used with another tool, <a href=\"https://www.skedpal.com\">SkedPal</a>. Now, with Tana&rsquo;s comprehensive capabilities, I no longer need multiple tools. Everything I need is right here.</p>\n<p>The transition to time-blocking was surprisingly simple. I added a due date field to my task super tag and included a calendar in the sidebar of my daily notes page. This let me drag tasks directly into the calendar, effectively time-blocking them. I also made a few tweaks, like adding the meeting tag to the calendar to see my appointments alongside tasks. For convenience, I created command buttons to quickly schedule tasks for the day. These enhancements, while minor, showcase Tana&rsquo;s adaptability.</p>\n<p>My primary goal with this experiment is to become more realistic about my commitments.

				"content_text": "As a [productivity expert](https://kenso.es), I'm always on the lookout for tools that can adapt to my ever-evolving workflow. This week, I decided to experiment with [Tana](https://tana.inc), a system that has become my go-to for task and project management. What I love about Tana is its flexibility—it can be molded to fit any workflow, making it an indispensable tool in my productivity arsenal.\n\nUntil recently, I organized my tasks using a Kanban system within Tana, categorizing them into three horizons: today's tasks, this week's tasks, and future tasks. This method worked well, but as someone who constantly seeks improvement, I wanted to try something new. Enter time-blocking—a technique I had previously used with another tool, [SkedPal](https://www.skedpal.com). Now, with Tana's comprehensive capabilities, I no longer need multiple tools. Everything I need is right here.\n\nThe transition to time-blocking was surprisingly simple. I added a due date field to my task super tag and included a calendar in the sidebar of my daily notes page. This let me drag tasks directly into the calendar, effectively time-blocking them. I also made a few tweaks, like adding the meeting tag to the calendar to see my appointments alongside tasks. For convenience, I created command buttons to quickly schedule tasks for the day. These enhancements, while minor, showcase Tana's adaptability.\n\nMy primary goal with this experiment is to become more realistic about my commitments. I have a tendency to overcommit, and by blocking tasks on my calendar, I can better understand how long tasks take and how limited my time truly is. This awareness is crucial for prioritizing effectively and ensuring that I focus on what truly matters.\n\nThis week-long experiment is a testament to Tana's flexibility. Whether it's task management, knowledge management, or contact management as a CRM, Tana adapts seamlessly to any workflow. While I'm not sure if time-blocking will become a permanent part of my routine, this trial has already highlighted the system's potential to enhance productivity.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2024/f23fc96245.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"324\" alt=\"The interface of the Tana application showing the sidebar with a calendarcontaining both events and tasks\">\n",

Now, I can quickly scan through my feed, opening only the articles that truly interest me, rather than feeling obligated to read everything.\n\n## Looking Forward to New Habits\nI'm excited to see how this new approach to handling information will evolve over time. The new Reeder has already made a positive impression on me, and I believe it will be a lasting change in how I consume content. If you’re looking for a more relaxed and efficient way to stay updated, I highly recommend giving the new Reeder a try. It might just transform your reading habits as it has mine.\n",

I never learned how to do things myself.</p>\n<p>During my education, while I still lived at home, I didn’t engage in much technical work either. I spent more time on the computer and doing administrative tasks, which I’m quite good at. But when it comes to DIY projects, that’s not my forte. I saw my father do it, but since I never really helped—beyond holding things and fetching tools—I never learned the skills.\nNow that we have our own home, there are occasional projects to tackle. However, I often run into problems because my skills and knowledge don’t match the level I want to achieve. When I want to fix or improve something, I have a vision of the outcome, but I’m not technically skilled enough to reach that outcome. It’s a matter of practice, but since our house is generally in good shape, there aren’t many opportunities to practice. This creates a vicious cycle: I don’t do many projects, so I don’t learn, and because I don’t learn, I’m hesitant to start new projects.</p>\n<p>For example, when painting needs to be done, we prefer to hire someone because the result is much better than if we did it ourselves. The same goes for replacing the shower, which we had done recently. I wouldn’t know where to start, and researching it would take a lot of time. Instead, we pay someone to do it. After all, how often in your life do you replace a shower or work on plumbing? Maybe once or twice, three times at most. It’s not a good investment of my time.</p>\n<p>There are, however, some things I can do. Recently, I replaced a light switch. It was a simple task, or so I thought. The new switch was a different model, so what I expected to be a straightforward job turned into a few hours of research. But in the end, it worked out perfectly.

				"content_html": "<p>Every year, I look forward to working in August. It might sound odd, but there&rsquo;s a unique charm to this month that makes it incredibly productive for me. While most people are on vacation, I find myself diving deep into my work with fewer distractions and more focus. Let me explain why August stands out as my most productive month and how I navigate its challenges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-beauty-of-fewer-distractions\">The Beauty of Fewer Distractions</h2>\n<p>One of the main reasons I love working in August is that almost all businesses are closed for the summer holidays. This means there&rsquo;s very little input from others, allowing me to focus solely on what I believe is most important. Without the need to consider others' schedules or demands, I can prioritize my tasks and work at my own pace. This autonomy is a significant factor in why I find August so productive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-downside-of-no-deadlines\">The Downside of No Deadlines</h2>\n<p>However, the lack of deadlines can be a double-edged sword. Without the pressure of time constraints, I sometimes fall into Parkinson&rsquo;s Law, where work expands to fill the time available. This can lead to taking more time than necessary to complete tasks, slightly diminishing productivity. It&rsquo;s a delicate balance to maintain, but being aware of this tendency helps me stay on track.</p>\n<h2 id=\"battling-the-summer-heat\">Battling the Summer Heat</h2>\n<p>Another challenge of working in August is the intense summer heat. With temperatures often soaring to 40 degrees Celsius, it can be tough to stay motivated and efficient. The heat slows me down, affects my sleep, and generally makes it harder to maintain a high level of productivity. To combat this, I adjust my schedule to work during the cooler parts of the day, like early mornings, and take it easier in the afternoons when the heat is at its peak.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-right-balance\">Finding the Right Balance</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s all about finding the right balance. On one hand, I enjoy fewer interruptions and less pressure, which allows me to work comfortably. On the other hand, I have to contend with the slower pace brought on by the summer heat. Recognizing the different rhythms of the year is crucial. Summer might be slower, but winter tends to be more intense. Adapting to these seasonal changes and adjusting my work habits accordingly helps me optimize my productivity throughout the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optimizing-productivity\">Optimizing Productivity</h2>\n<p>To make the most of August, I focus on my peak concentration times, which for me is mid-morning. I plan my most critical tasks for this period and leave less demanding activities for the afternoon when my energy levels dip. By aligning my work with my natural rhythms and the seasonal environment, I can maintain a high level of productivity even during the hottest month of the year.</p>\n",

Without the pressure of time constraints, I sometimes fall into Parkinson's Law, where work expands to fill the time available. This can lead to taking more time than necessary to complete tasks, slightly diminishing productivity. It's a delicate balance to maintain, but being aware of this tendency helps me stay on track.\n\n## Battling the Summer Heat\nAnother challenge of working in August is the intense summer heat. With temperatures often soaring to 40 degrees Celsius, it can be tough to stay motivated and efficient. The heat slows me down, affects my sleep, and generally makes it harder to maintain a high level of productivity. To combat this, I adjust my schedule to work during the cooler parts of the day, like early mornings, and take it easier in the afternoons when the heat is at its peak.\n\n## Finding the Right Balance\nUltimately, it's all about finding the right balance. On one hand, I enjoy fewer interruptions and less pressure, which allows me to work comfortably. On the other hand, I have to contend with the slower pace brought on by the summer heat. Recognizing the different rhythms of the year is crucial. Summer might be slower, but winter tends to be more intense. Adapting to these seasonal changes and adjusting my work habits accordingly helps me optimize my productivity throughout the year.\n\n## Optimizing Productivity\nTo make the most of August, I focus on my peak concentration times, which for me is mid-morning. I plan my most critical tasks for this period and leave less demanding activities for the afternoon when my energy levels dip. By aligning my work with my natural rhythms and the seasonal environment, I can maintain a high level of productivity even during the hottest month of the year.\n",

These methods better fit the specific situation and needs of the people.\n\n## Related:\n* [Link the desired behavior to a clear signal](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/link-desired-behaviour.html)\n* [Spend a little attention on planning and organizing your tasks, but not more than necessary; then, get to work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/03/spent-a-little.html)\n",

It could be something you see, hear, or read about. Stop to look at the unusual car parked at the curb, taste the new item on the cafeteria menu, actually listen to your colleague at the office. How is this different from other similar cars, dishes or conversations? What is its essence? Don’t assume that you already know what these things are all about, or that even if you knew them, they wouldn’t matter anyway. Experience this one thing for what it is, not what you think it is.

Nevertheless, the findings suggest that a four-day workweek could be a viable option for companies looking to improve employee well-being without significant negative impacts on productivity.\n\n## Related:\n* [The optimal amount of free time seems to be between 2 and 4 hours per day](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/16/free-time.html)\n* [Our go-to approach for problem-solving is to incorporate something new, rather than eliminate something existing](https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/10/substraction-neglect.html)\n* [Professionals spend about 60% of their time on work about work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/12/15/work-about-work.html)\n* [Large organizations extinguish employees' passion](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/large-organisations-kill.html)\n* [The expectation that you check email outside of working hours can lead to health problems, relationship issues, and anxiety](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/11/15/boundaries.html)\n* [Hard work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/08/31/173746.html)\n",

				"content_html": "<p>People who have their own office talk 70% more often with colleagues than those who work in a large, open space. This is remarkable because many people think that those in an open office talk more with each other. But that&rsquo;s not the case. In an open office, people are often less inclined to talk to each other. This is likely because they feel watched or because there are too many distractions. As a result, colleagues talk less spontaneously with each other, which is unfortunate for collaboration and new ideas.</p>\n<p>Instead of talking directly to each other, people in open offices tend to send emails more often.

				"content_text": "People who have their own office talk 70% more often with colleagues than those who work in a large, open space. This is remarkable because many people think that those in an open office talk more with each other. But that's not the case. In an open office, people are often less inclined to talk to each other.

As a result, colleagues talk less spontaneously with each other, which is unfortunate for collaboration and new ideas.\n\nInstead of talking directly to each other, people in open offices tend to send emails more often. Emailing can be convenient, but it's not the same as a real conversation. For example, with emailing, you miss facial expressions and tone of voice.

A 2013 study from the University of Minnesota showed that people working in messy rooms were more likely to come up with creative ideas than those in tidy offices. This may mean that a chaotic environment helps to think differently and come up with new ideas.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are also studies that say messy places do not affect how well you can think. Research shows that the amount of clutter in a workspace has no effect on things like planning, attention, and problem-solving.

				"content_text": "On one hand, some studies suggest that messy spaces can stimulate creativity. A 2013 study from the University of Minnesota showed that people working in messy rooms were more likely to come up with creative ideas than those in tidy offices. This may mean that a chaotic environment helps to think differently and come up with new ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also studies that say messy places do not affect how well you can think. Research shows that the amount of clutter in a workspace has no effect on things like planning, attention, and problem-solving. This means that, although a messy environment may promote creativity, it does not directly impact how well you think.\n\nUltimately, it seems that the effect of a messy workplace depends on personal preference. Some people are inspired by clutter, while others work better in a tidy space. It is important to discover which environment suits you best, as there is no clear answer to whether clutter affects creativity or cognitive ability.\n\n## Related:\n* [People with a wandering mind (ADHD) are motivated by actions that captivate, create, compete, or complete](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/11/02/people-with-a.html)\n* [Sorting emails into folders wastes a lot of time; use one archive folder and search for emails when you need them instead](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/02/sorting-emails-into.html)\n* [Physical cues affect our state of mind and can be used to switch between different productive modes](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/06/environment.html)\n* [Scatterfocus](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/scatterfocus.html)\n* [Systems maintenance](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/01/11/evaluate-whether-the.html)\n* [Eufriction](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/07/29/eufriction.html)\n",

At this high noise level, it becomes harder to think clearly, which can reduce your creativity. It's like trying to solve a difficult problem in a concert hall; the loud noise makes it difficult to concentrate and think clearly. Therefore, it's important to find a balance in the noise level of your environment if you want to be creative. A little background noise can be helpful, but too much can be counterproductive.\n\n## Related:\n\n* [An increase of 10 dB noise in the workplace reduces productivity by 5%](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/24/noise-pollution.html)\n",

We tend not to prioritize them. We tend to think that to get together there has to be a reason involved. We have to have an event or some purpose to it. A run or a round of golf. Making a batch of beer or building a deck. Or we need to get the families together, let our partners talk and kids play. Dinner or a barbecue. Often, we guys never seem to think of getting together “just because”. For no reason at all other than to connect. Have a chit chat about anything under the sun. Or, sit in silence together and just be.\n<footer>Patrick Rhone<cite> <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/thinking-about-friendships/\">https://www.patrickrhone.net/thinking-about-friendships/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote><script note=\"\" src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n",

It's about finding the right balance. A little stress can help us be more productive and think better, but too much stress can lead to negative feelings and be bad for our health. People with stress also give and receive emotional support more often, which can lead to a richer social life. Therefore, it is important to find a level of stress that keeps us alert without harming our health.\n\n## Related\n\n* [Decision fatigue only affects people who believe that willpower runs out quickly](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/04/06/decision-fatigue-only.html)\n* [Cold showers temporarily reduce your cognitive performance](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/cold-showers-probably.html)\n",

It surprised me, since we live in a global world…</p>\n<p>Up to plan B. I asked my father for his phone and proceeded to purchase the keyboard app. Of course, my father never purchased any app, so I had to set up a payment method for his account. Apple offers several options here:</p>\n<p>First there is the credit card/debit card. My father does not have a credit card, but does have a credit card. However, his card number is alphanumerical and the interface only allowed me to enter numbers. So I tried my credit card, but again, Apple won&rsquo;t allow a Spanish credit card be used for a Dutch account.</p>\n<p>Then there was the option to use PayPal, which obviously my father hasn&rsquo;t got either.</p>\n<p>Next in the list was the option to pay be telephone on selected carriers (of course, no mention of which those selected carriers are). I entered my father&rsquo;s phone number and pressed OK, but nothing happened. I assume that my father&rsquo;s carrier is not one of the selected carriers, but there was no error message at all.</p>\n<p>Finally on the list was iDeal, a protocol developed by the Dutch banks specially for online purchases.

What?</p>\n<p>After looking around a little bit, I found out that Apple had not implemented iDeal as a payment method, as most online stores do, but rather as a method to top up the balance on the Apple Account.</p>\n<p>So I proceeded to use iDeal to get money on my mother&rsquo;s account. I transferred the minimum amount (1€), got passed to the banking app, accepted the transaction and got sent back to the App Store, which gave me an erro message.

				"content_html": "<p>People with ADHD are often motivated by activities that captivate them, stimulate creativity, ignite competition, or provide a sense of completion. This is because traditional external motivators, such as rewards and punishments, are often less effective for people with ADHD. Their minds tend towards intrinsic motivation, where the activity itself must be attractive and stimulating to hold their attention. Actions that captivate, such as exciting or new tasks, can pique their interest and help them stay focused.</p>\n<p>Creative activities provide another source of motivation for people with ADHD. The process of creating, whether it be art, writing, or coming up with new ideas, can help channel their thoughts and use their energy in a productive way. Creativity provides an outlet for their often overactive mind and can give them a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Competition and completing tasks are also powerful motivators.</p>\n<p>Competitive situations, whether it be sports, games, or work-related challenges, can hold the attention of people with ADHD through the excitement and desire to win.

				"content_text": "People with ADHD are often motivated by activities that captivate them, stimulate creativity, ignite competition, or provide a sense of completion. This is because traditional external motivators, such as rewards and punishments, are often less effective for people with ADHD. Their minds tend towards intrinsic motivation, where the activity itself must be attractive and stimulating to hold their attention. Actions that captivate, such as exciting or new tasks, can pique their interest and help them stay focused.\n\nCreative activities provide another source of motivation for people with ADHD. The process of creating, whether it be art, writing, or coming up with new ideas, can help channel their thoughts and use their energy in a productive way. Creativity provides an outlet for their often overactive mind and can give them a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Competition and completing tasks are also powerful motivators.\n\nCompetitive situations, whether it be sports, games, or work-related challenges, can hold the attention of people with ADHD through the excitement and desire to win. Similarly, completing tasks, no matter how small, can give a sense of achievement and satisfaction, motivating them to continue and set new goals. These intrinsic motivators help people with ADHD stay focused and productive, despite their tendency towards a wandering mind.\n\n## Related:\n* [Take regular ‘thinking walks’ to change your brain to enhance thinking, creativity and memory](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/15/take-regular-thinking.html)\n* [Messy work environments have no effect on either creativity or executive functions](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/07/07/messy-work-environments.html)\n* [Motivation](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/30/convince-yourself-that.html)\n* [Scatterfocus](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/give-your-mind.html)\n",

				"content_text": "When people can easily understand information, for example through good sound quality, it positively influences their trust in that information. This is because smooth and clear communication creates a sense of reliability. When information is presented without glitches or disturbances, listeners experience less cognitive load, meaning they have to exert less effort to process the message. This ease leads people to more quickly consider the information as true and reliable.\n\nResearch has shown that when information is difficult to process, for example due to poor sound quality or a strong accent, people are more likely to judge the information as less true or convincing. This effect occurs even when the difficulty arises from insignificant features, such as the color of the text or the pronunciation of a name. The idea is that anything that makes processing information difficult creates a barrier to the trust people have in that information.\n\nGood sound quality and clear communication thus play a crucial role in how information is received and evaluated. By ensuring that information is easy to understand, speakers and organizations can increase the trust of their audience. This underscores the importance of attention to detail in communication, such as the clarity of the audio and the articulation of the speaker, to have a positive impact on how the message is received.\n\n## Related:\n* [When helping someone, give that person enough information and boost their confidence by showing how that information can help others](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/when-helping-someone.html)\n",

This is different from Type 1 decisions, which have consequences that are difficult or impossible to reverse. By acting quickly on decisions that can be reversed, we can save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on overthinking and analyzing.\n\nThe Pareto principle, which states that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts, can help with this. Instead of striving for complete certainty, which is often not possible, we can make decisions based on the most important 20% of information we have. This makes the decision-making process faster and allows us to act and learn from the results more quickly.\n\nTaking quick decisions that can easily be reversed gives us the opportunity to test what works and what doesn't in practice. Often, you only truly know if a decision is good when you try it out. If the result is not good, you can easily adjust or reverse the decision. This process of deciding, testing, and adjusting allows for a flexible approach, enabling us to make progress faster and respond better to changes.\n\n## Related:\n* [Take the time before doing something you can't undo](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/take-your-time.html)\n* [Try to complete new tasks on the day you receive them](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/12/22/move-fast.html)\n* [Start with as little as possible and add complexity as you go](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/11/05/start-with-as.html)\n",

Keep adjusting and improving your approach so that it fits well with what you need, both personally and professionally.\n\n## Related:\n* [Take the time to think about, dream of, and look forward to future activities](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/dedicate-time-to.html)\n* [Modern work is unconfined work](https://jeroensangers.com/2024/10/15/modern-work-is.html)\n* [Take the time before doing something you can't undo](https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/take-your-time.html)\n* [Spend a little attention on planning and organizing your tasks, but not more than necessary; then, get to work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/02/03/spent-a-little.html)\n* [Hard work](https://jeroensangers.com/2022/08/31/173746.html)\n",

For example, David Allen’s Getting Things Done (GTD) book, which became very popular in software circles, uses the term productivity very loosely. Many of the core examples in the GTD method relate to general activities such as cleaning one’s garage as opposed to working with knowledge. And the GTD principles have no reference to cognitive science, even though cognitive science is the modern interdisciplinary science of understanding the information processing we do in our brains, with or without the aid of technology.\n<footer>Luc P.

				"content_text": "Last week I started writing up my <strong>Personal Knowledge Management Workflow</strong> as part of that workflow.\n\nYou know, the best notes are about note taking, just like the most popular blogs are about blogging and the most popular YouTube videos are about creating YouTube videos.\n\nBack to my notes.\n\nWhen describing the concept of <strong>garbage in = garbage out</strong> I realised that it had been ages since I pruned the RSS feeds I consult each day during breakfast.\n\nSo I left my notes to take a deep dive into my <a href=\"http://inoreader.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inoreader</a> account. This turned out to be a multi-hour project, so I chunked the task as any productive human would do.\n\nThen, when checking <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> between two chunks, I ran into a post called <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/feed-reading-by-social-distance/\">Feed Reading By Social Distance</a> by Ton Zijlstra. I loved the idea!\n\nUntil now I have always organised my feeds by <em>interestingness</em>, using numbered folders:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Quality control:</strong> my own publications which I always want to check first.</li>\n    <li><strong>Interesting:</strong> my favourite blogs which I want to read whenever I can.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bulk:</strong> the rest of the posts.</li>\n    <li><strong>Triage: </strong>new subscriptions that I want to try out before moving them to ‘Bulk’.</li>\n    <li><strong>Whenever I have the time</strong>: some high volume feeds that I usually skipped.</li>\n</ol>\n\nAfter reading Tom's post, I first renamed all my feeds with the author name. As Tom said: feeds express a personal relation.\n\nI unsubscribed from most business and group blogs, with a few exceptions for some blogs run by two or three people I know well.\n\nThen I dedicated several hours to reorganise the 242 remaining feeds into social distance based folders:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>My Publications</strong>: this folder actually has number 0, but in HTML it is complicated to create numbered lists not starting at 1 and being strictly sequential.</li>\n    <li><strong>Close Contacts</strong>: People I know well and with whom I have a relation spanning several years.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dunbar's Tribe</strong>: feeds from people I know in real life, through digital exchanges or by having followed them for over a decade (as long as they also publish some personal information).</li>\n    <li><strong>Outer circle</strong>: interesting writing by people I don't know at all.</li>\n    <li><strong>The Fire Hose</strong>: some feeds by businesses. I assigned number 99 to this folder to indicate the correct social distance.</li>\n</ol>\n\nWhile reviewing all those feeds I also made sure they are all configured to use the ‘https’ protocol, that they use the current domain name (some blogs moved from using the platform's subdomain to having their own domain) and to use a current feed address.\n\nSpeaking of the latter, it surprised me to see that several blogs, including some high volume sites, still channel their feeds through <a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feedburner</a>.\n\nSo there we are, all feeds organised and read. Not the only thing I can do to procrastinate a bit more is write about it on my blog…\n",

Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>\n<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet.

See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>\n<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Single Point of Failure<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>\n<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expectation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was that tweets with shortened links get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clicked less<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit.ly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>\n<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service, which was invoked by adding the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>\n<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chi-squared<!-- raw HTML omitted --> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>\n<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <!-- raw HTML omitted -->calculate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more successful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (p = 0.0439).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not have any benefits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for me and it even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reduces clicks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>\n",

To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.\n\n<h2>Experimenting</h2>\n\nFor conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code>\n\nI prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href=\"http://bitly.com/\">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.\n\nI decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <a href=\"http://tweko.com\">Tweko</a> service, which was invoked by adding the <code>#tweko</code> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.\n\nOf course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment -- the tweet with the shortened URL -- a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.\n\n<h3>Tweet 1 -- Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\">Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/2iZFFblXsn\">http://bit.ly/1c8gCuw</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/371931328067153920\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Tweet 2 -- No Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\"><p>Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/ekVvviOOni\">http://canasto.es/2010/03/como-g...</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/372006931189481472\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The results</h2>\n\n<p>After a few weeks I decided to have a look at the statistics in Google Analytics. I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named 'TestShortener' to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field 'ad content' as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th>Visits</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <tfoot>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total</td>\n      <td>820</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tfoot>\n</table>\n\nClearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample's success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.\n\nIn order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href=\"http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95\">calculate</a>:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th># successes</th>\n      <th># trials</th>\n      <th>Confidence interval</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe verdict is that the 'NoShortener' sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).\n\n<h2>My conclusion</h2>\n\nFor me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.\n",

On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.</p>\n<p>I know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google&rsquo;s servers. To me it makes no sense that &ndash;even though one application increased its security&ndash; the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.</p>\n<p>I finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can&rsquo;t use Google anymore as my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenID provider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web &ndash;those that require registration&ndash; I want to comment on.

Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <em>backup verification codes</em>. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky 'finder' the possibility to get into your Google account <strong>without</strong> needing the SMS confirmation.\n\nI immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that --with the current roaming rates in Europe-- they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!\n\n<h3>External applications</h3>\n\nSatisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Some mobile or desktop applications that work outside of a browser aren't yet compatible with 2-step verification. These applications are hard-coded to ask for a username and password, and do not prompt for a verification code. If you want one of these applications to access your Google Account, you must enter an application-specific password, not your Google Account password, when asked for a password.\n</blockquote>\n\nI went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> for iPhone, FlipBook, <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> for iPad, <a href=\"http://www.feedly.com/\">Feedly</a>, <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.\n\n<h3>Does it make sense?</h3>\n\nAfter a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.\n\nI know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google's servers. To me it makes no sense that --even though one application increased its security-- the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.\n\nI finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can't use Google anymore as my <a href=\"http://smarterware.org/6286/how-to-set-up-openid-on-your-own-domain\">OpenID provider</a>, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web --those that require registration-- I want to comment on. Too much of a hassle to be functional...\n",

El Canasto quickly took the lead in the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong> category, and maintained the first position until the end of the voting period.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow the jury will be announced, and they have until Friday to choose among the top three of each category, which means that I have about 33% chance of winning the price.</p>\n<p>What makes me even more proud is that El Canasto ended at the 10th position on the list of most voted blogs, which in my opinion is really good for a blog in a not so mainstream niche.</p>\n<p>The final winners will be announced this Saturday in Seville, and of course I am going to be there to see whether I won the price and to meet a lot of other bloggers.

When I came to live in Spain, I was used to drive all day with the lights of my car turned on for better visibility.</p>\n<p>However, the people over here do not have that custom, and friendly as they are, they tried to warn me to tell that I forgot to turn off my lights. That is nice if it happens a few times, but actually it happened several times a day, and after a week I was getting quite fed-up with it. So I stopped driving with the lights turned on during daytime.</p>\n<p>This week, the Spanish government started a campaign to tell people about the enhanced security when driving with the car lights turned on. Guess who is happily driving around with the lights on again?</p>\n",

Well, part of the program is the election of the best Spanish blogs, and my blog <a href=\"http://canasto.es/\">El Canasto</a> makes a very good chance of being elected as the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong>!

But now that I start writing I realise that I am by far the right person for writing on this topic. Right now I am sitting in my own house behind my €1400 Macbook with a high speed broadband internet connection. What am I supposed to know about poverty? I (and all my readers as well) probably belong to the richest 1% of the world.</p>\n<p>For me poverty is something they show on TV. Only once in a while I see poor people begging for money on the street, and I know that I can ignore them because I happen to live in a country with excellent social services that will take care of these people. For my own conscience, I make my contributions to some NGO's to pay of my guilt debt. When I read back these lines, it sounds very cold, which is not how I am, but there is a great deal of truth in it.</p>\n<p>Only twice in my life I actually saw poverty with my own eyes, when I visited Lesotho and Thailand, and it greatly affected me. More than that, it made me realise how lucky I am. We dedicate about 2% of our income to charity, which is an amount we won't even miss, but which makes a great difference for the people depending on it.</p>\n<p>I encourage everybody reading this to do the same: realise how lucky and incredibly rich you are, and donate 1-2% of your income. Together we can stop poverty.</p>\n",

I have read some good things about <a href=\"http://mozy.com/home\">Mozy</a> though, so I decided to give it a try. I signed up for the MozyHome Free account to test the service, installed the software and selected some backup sets to start with. A few hours later the initial backup was ready (I only selected 250Mb).</p>\n<p>Happy with the results, I changed user to do the same, but Mozy could not find any files because it was still looking for files in <code>/home/Jeroen</code>. This very much surprised me, as I was used to Carbonite running as a service and being able to backup files from all users. I assumed that Mozy would not work the same, but that I could configure the files to backup on a per user basis. I couldn't find how to do so... I checked the FAQs on the Mozy site, but most of the texts have been written for Windows users.</p>\n<p>And today I received an e-mail from Mozy explaining me how to get started with Mozy… on Windows.</p>\n<p>I am not sure what to do with the software. The initial backup went fine, but it is a real bummer that the backup is limited to only one user.</p>\n",

I also choose English as my preferred language for everything related with IT, as more software and documentation is available in English, and because of the horrible translations in the first Dutch operating systems.</p>\n<p>When I moved to Spain, I only knew a little bit of Spanish, so I decided to dive into it, and convert my whole life to Spanish. I wrote my own personal notes in Spanish, my PCs had the Spanish version of Windows, my to-do lists and calendar were in Spanish, and little by little my Spanish improved.</p>\n<p>Now that I have lived here for a little bit more than six years, doing everything in Spanish started to feel a little bit forced. A few months back I changed the language of my mobile phone to English, and suddenly I realized that it is indeed possible to fit the texts on the tiny screen. My phone instantly became easier to use.</p>\n<p>Then I got a new laptop. Though initially and by habit installed in Spanish, I felt more at home when I changed it into English (fortunately, in Mac OS X the operating system language is a user preference, so I didn't need to reinstall). And since the tools I worked with are in English, I also enter the data (to-do items, appointments, etc.) in English.</p>\n<p>For each aspect of my life, I choose whether it is best to do in Dutch, English or Spanish. For example, whenever I am writing on El Canasto, I prefer that everything is in Spanish in order not to lose any time translating. Therefore, my brainstorming, saved text fragments and Movable Type are in Spanish. I also found that even though I am fully trilingual, you can't beat 37 years of experience in a language. Deeper thinking and difficult tasks are thus easier to do in Dutch.</p>\n<p>You see: each language has its place.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This year's topic is the environment.</em></p>\n<p>Camping is my favourite holiday activity. In our tent I feel free and I feel at home as I use my own stuff and sleep in my own sack. Furthermore, it is very easy for a shy person like me to have contact with others on a camping. I feel a lot more comfortable on a camping than in hotel and apartments.</p>\n<p>However, lately I noticed a trend of people camping more and more luxury: huge caravans with satellite television, microwave ovens, washing machine, skottelbraai, and even a motor to move around on the camping. While I like some comfort, one of the things I like about camping is its simpleness: less things around you means less cleaning and less worrying and thus more relaxing. And it still is possible:</p>\n<p>When I still lived in the Netherlands, I was a member of the <a href=\"http://kampeerclub.nl/\">NTKC</a>, a club of people who love camping in a simple and quiet way. The NTKC owns 22 campings in natural areas, and all the maintenance and administration is done by club members. On the NTKC terrains, people camp with tents up to 1.90 meters high and always in natural colours. When staying for a longer period, members move their tent to prevent dead grass.</p>\n<p>Most of the time there is plenty of room on the campings; in spring and autumn it might happen that you won't see anybody else from your tent!</p>\n<p>For me, being in the middle of nature is a very relaxing experience. If you live in the Netherlands and enjoy camping and nature, be sure to check out the NTKC. There are similar organisations elsewhere, such as the <a href=\"http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/\">Camping and Caravanning&nbsp; Club</a> in the U.K..</p>\n",

Some days ago I looked at some teenagers and noticed that all of them were listening to a MP3 player, but none of them had an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPod-Nano-Video-Silver%2Fdp%2FB000JO7PIM&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\">iPod</a>.</p>\n<p>As the iPod is certainly the hippest and easiest to use MP3 player on the market, I assumed that at least some teenagers would have one, while others would settle for a cheaper model. The iPods is indeed more expensive than other players, but usually pricing is not that big problem for teenagers if the device is cool enough.</p>\n<p>I decided to ask a teacher who also owns an iPod about his view on the subject, and he gave me a very simple explanation.</p>\n<p><strong>The iPod is anti-social</strong>.</p>\n<p>For teenagers, gadgets only have one function: communicating and sharing with friends. The first thing they do after downloading a song from internet is share it with their friends. And well, the iPod simply won't let them do that.</p>\n<p>Songs on the iPod are locked up and are only accessible from iTunes on the original PC. Furthermore, to connect an iPod to a PC you need a cable and there is no way a teenagers is going to walk around with an un-sexy USB cable.</p>\n<p>A for teenagers successful MP3 player has an incorporated USB port (usually hidden under a cap) so they can connect it easily to any PC (at school, at their friend's home,...) and it should simply work like a memory stick with the MP3 files accessible from the operating system for easy copying of files.</p>\n<p>As you know, I am not a very social person, and therefore I am perfectly happy without an iPod.</p>\n",

Scroll down until you find a line with `` and paste the following code just above that line (you can of course also choose another position for the recent comments widget):\n\n<code>&lt;div class=\"widget-archives widget\"&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=\"widget-header\"&gt;Recent Comments&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"widget-content\"&gt;\n&lt;ul class=\"widget-list\"&gt;\n&lt;li class=\"widget-list-item\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#comment-&lt;br /&gt;\"&gt; on &lt;a&lt;br /&gt;href=\"\"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code>\n\nNow in any template where you want to show the recent comments (e.g. the main index template or the individual archive template) you add the following line: ``\nRebuild your weblog, and it should show you the five latest comments in the sidebar, just as you can see on this blog.\n",

Many people I speak to have only one dream: becoming a civil servant. Unlike most other modern countries, in Spain civil servants earn way more that people working in companies. Add to that some very good secondary labour conditions and a <strong>contract for life</strong> without performance objectives, and you can understand why most people working for companies envy those others.</p>\n<p>Just an example: most teachers earn about 25% more than I do (and my wage is higher than the average company worker). For that money, they work 18–22 hours a week at the school, plus some hours at home for preparation and revision of exams, while I work 8,5 hours a day, five days a week. Furthermore, while I have four weeks of holidays, they get two whole months in summer, two weeks at christmas and another week at eastern!</p>\n<p>Other civil servants might not have such a long holidays as the teachers, but they do enjoy other benefits. Knowing all this, I am still surprised whenever I see the huge economical growth Spain is making with such a big and inefficient civil overhead.</p>\n",

As you see in the sidebar, I currently <del>maintain</del> have four weblogs.</p>\n<p>The oldest of the four is <a href=\"http://braintags.com/\">Brain Tags</a>, running since ages on Movable Type. Then I have a weblog called <b>The Wizard of POS</b>, until today running on the same MT installation as Brain Tags and available at ‘pos.braintags.com’. There is also an old blog about my web hosting adventures, which I haven't updated in ages, called <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/weblog\">Brytenet weblog</a> and just as the rest of the Brytenet site managed with eZ Publish. And finally I have my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href=\"http://canasto.es/\">El Canasto</a> maganed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Quite a mess, isn't it? Add to that the fact that I have been experimenting a lot with non-public weblogs, and you'll get an idea of what things look like.</p>\n<p>So I decided to clean things up, and do it well. You'll notice from the links in the side bar that I have presented my blogs as <strong>The Brain Network</strong>, a name I never have been satisfied with. Anyway, I acquired a new short and flashy domain name (of course hosted by <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">Brytenet</a>) and made a fresh MT4 installation. This will be the home of <strong>Brain Tags</strong>, <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, <strong>El Canasto</strong> and a new network blog (I still have to decide whether I want to continue with the Brytenet Weblog).</p>\n<p>Until now I have re-created <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, imported all existing entries, comments and trackbacks, and tweaked the default template. And by the way, I gave it its own domain name, <a href=\"http://pos-wizard.com/\">pos-wizard.com</a>.</p>\n<p>There is still a lot of work to be done (and I have little time), but I already feel good about the new <em>home</em> for my weblogs and am looking forward to being able to manage all my blogs from a single screen.</p>\n",

Therefore, my writings made on Wednesdays ended up at the end of the list;</li>\n<li>As there still are relatively few Pipes, it is easy to game the listing, which is sorted by the number of times a Pipe has been run. I simply clicked a few time on the <em>Run this Pipe</em> link, and little by little moved upwards in the list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Two minutes more clicking, and my <em>Brain Network</em> pipe ended up halfway on the second page, in front of some way more interesting feeds.

Robert Scoble published a good overview of the most important networks in <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/\">Competitors of PodTech that I love, er, going to the Content Mall</a>. A content mall is the same as a blogging network.</p>\n<p>As I am interested in blogging in general, I have been following various blogging networks for some time. I can clearly see the benefits of blogging networks for the bloggers involved, but have been wondering for a long time what the benefit is for the visitors of a site part of a blogging network. So I posted the following <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164130\">comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is clear that 'content malls' bring in huge benefits for the sites within a mall. They can work together and link to each other to boost PR.</p>\n<p>But what benefit is there for the visitors? Shopping malls bring benefit by sharing a physical space with various stores. After going shopping for clothes I can buy some electronics without having to drive to another place. Very comfortable.</p>\n<p>But when visiting a fashion weblog part of a content mall I can go to the technology weblog of that mall just as fast as I can go to any other techblog. I won't visit the technology weblog because it belongs to a certain group, but rather because I like it in spite of being part of that group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164224\">Answered</a> promptly by Robert self:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By joining a network a blogger/podcaster/videoblogger will probably be able to get paid much more than if he/she tries to do it on his/her own.</p>\n<p>That money might let them quit their jobs (that's what happened to <a href=\"http://GeekBrief.TV\">GeekBrief.TV</a>, for instance) which will enable that person to produce even more content for you. Or, maybe, afford better equipment. Or, maybe be able to afford a trip to more industry conferences where they'll be able to bring you more news and information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Robert completely hits the nail on its head here.

But businesses will be able to control distribution via a Microsoft-provided blocking tool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though a new version of the most popular web browser is definitely needed (the rendering engine is more than 6 years old, and there are many security problems) I wonder whether it is a good iedea to push it through the throat of so many people. This is going to lead to a lot of problems.</p>\n<p>I am not afraid of websites that suddenly don't look so nice as before or that even stop working. The webmasters of such sites already had the chance to improve that ever since Firefox became popular, and if they still haven't updated their sites they will soon enough as visitors start complaining.</p>\n<p>No, the main problem lies in the tight integration with the operating system, and the many third-party applications that make use of IE functionality. Though websites can be updated on a single place to fix the problem for once and ever, this is a lot harder for applications installed on millions of PC's.</p>\n<p>A few months ago we have found that some of our applications are incompattible with IE7, giving an ‘Invalid URL format’ error. We quietly started looking for a solution for this problem, expecting that IE7 would be released together with Windows Vista or as an optional download. The <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/26/678149.aspx\">announcement </a> that Microsoft is going to push IE7 as an automatic update surely is going to give us some problems, as we are going to have to solve this bug and update all our customers before the end of Q3!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>After reading the lifehacker <a href=\"http://www.lifehacker.com/software/how-i-work/\">How I work</a> series, I thought that it might be interesting to write down my own way of working for the readers of Brain Tags.</p>\n<h2>What desktop software do you use every day?</h2>\n<p>As most people I have two sites from where I work: in the office I sell and support the products of <a href=\"http://www.ICG.es/\">ICG software</a>, and at home I run <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">BryteNet</a>, do some web development, blog and keep in contact with me friends all over the world. At both places I use a Windows XP desktop PC, equipped with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\">Firefox</a></strong> I use the Internet a lot, and have always have some tabs open with sites I want to read whenever I have a spare moment, e.g. when I am on hold. With Internet Explorer I would have my task bar cluttered with screens, but Firefox's tabs keep things organized.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.activewords.com/\">ActiveWords</a></strong> Whenever I have to work on a PC without ActiveWords I feel very clumsy. ActiveWords automatically corrects my typing errors, opens my applications, fills in texts and generally saves me a lot of time.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/\">Trillian</a></strong> With customers and friends all over the world I use instant messaging all the time. The problem is that everybody uses another application, and the different applications (MSN, ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Google Chat,…) do not talk together. Instead of installing a separate client for each protocol, I use Trillian, which 'speaks' all those protocols.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://skype.com/\">Skype</a></strong> Instead of sending messages, it is more efficient to actually talk to somebody. That is where Skype comes in, as I can talk with any other Skype user for free.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>In the office:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> We are a Microsoft shop, so obviously use Outlook. Most of my colleagues use it exclusively for e-mail, but I spend more time in the calendar and tasks. Of course I had to make some adjustments, as the Microsoft way of doing things does not always coincide with my own. So I installed <a href=\"http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/\">Outlook Quotefix</a> to stop Outlook from top-posting when I reply to messages and to trim the headers in my replies. Furthermore I use the <a href=\"http://gtdsupport.netcentrics.com/learn/\">Getting Things Done add-in</a> to streamline my workflow and the <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download&trk=ftr_ol\">LinkedIn toolbar</a> to create contacts directly from people's signatures and to keep them updated when contacts change their <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/sangers\">LinkedIn profile</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/desktopsearch/enterprise/default.mspx\">Windows Enterprise Desktop Search</a></strong> We have a lot of information scattered over a few places on several servers and of course on my own PC. Windows Desktop Search brings that all together, as I have it index all items in Outlook (mail, tasks, notes, contacts), and all documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML and PDF) on my PC and the servers. I use the enterprise edition as it has a much cleaner interface than the MSN edition.</li>\n<li><strong>ICG Software</strong> Of course we have our own applications installed. Not only for giving support, but also for invoicing and tracking customer activity (CRM).</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.unyte.net/\">Unyte</a></strong> Unyte is a free add-on for Skype that allows you to share an application on your PC with the person(s) on Skype. I use it to give demonstrations, training and support to our foreign customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>At home:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/\">Thunderbird</a></strong> My e-mail client of choice. It is fast and complete. Of course I use the IMAP protocol instead of POP3, so I always have all my important messages on the mail server to be accessed through webmail.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.palm.com/us/software/desktop/\">Palm Desktop</a></strong> At home I don't need an advanced planner, so this simple (and free!) calendar, task list and contact list fulfills all my needs.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/\">Ecto</a></strong> Blogging made easy. A real blogger does not write in small <code>textarea</code> fields, but uses a full blown desktop client.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.chami.com/html-kit/\">HTML-Kit</a></strong> I used to do my coding work in notepad, but noticed that I needed some more features. Since then I use HTML-Kit to do all my coding.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.rssbandit.org/\">RSS-Bandit</a></strong> To stay up-to-date with what is happening in the world I follow the writings on several web sites. Instead of visiting these sites every day, A read their feeds in RSS-Bandit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What web sites do you use every day?</h2>\n<p>Just in terms of raw weekly hours, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\">Google</a> is definitely number one. In addition to regular old searching, I use it for looking up definitions, as a calculator, and for checking stuff like maps and weather. I do love the Google.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I use <a href=\"http://getharvest.com/\">Harvest</a> to track my worked hours.</p>\n<p>All other sites enter in RSS-Bandit, which is my dashboard to the world. It shows me tech news, news about my friends, search results on topics I am interested in, comments made on my weblogs, replies to comments I have left on other blogs…</p>\n<h2>What PDA/personal organizer/system do you use to keep organized?</h2>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2004/07/palmone_zire_31/\">Palm Zire 31</a>, which I keep synchronized with my two workstations.

That whole safety thing you have to suffer through every time? He turned it into a comedy routine: “Please pretend to pay attention while we explain the safety features of this Boeing 737. I know, I can't believe it either, but there's a safety card in the seat pocket in front of you. No one ever reads it, so I'm not going to even bother asking you to. At this time, you should have your seatbelts on, your tray tables up, and your seats in their upright and most uncomfortable position. This is a no complaining, no whining, no smoking flight. If you absolutely must smoke, I suggest you avail yourself of our smoking area out on the wing...that is, if you can manage to get it lit. While you're out there, feel free to enjoy our inflight movie, Gone With The Wind. We don't expect a loss of cabin pressure today. If we did, the three of us would have called in sick. But if we do lose pressure, masks will automatically fall from the ceiling. After you're done screaming, simply put the mask on and breath normally, like this: [Darth Vader Imitation]. Please put your own mask on before helping your children...or those who are acting like children, such as your husband. Now, since we've been cleared for take-off, I'd like to ask you to lean over and please press your face against the window so that all those other bankrupt airlines can see that we have a full flight. Neener, neener! And thank you for flying Southwest today. Remember, no one loves you, or your money more than Southwest!\"\n\n</blockquote>\n\n[Found at: <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/the_filter_week_of_april_21.php\">Signal vs. Noise</a>]\n",

It automatically organizes entries tagged with <code>listing</code> on the Edgeio site, and allows visitors to search and comment on listings. The concept sounds very interesting to me, so I decided to try it out.</p>\n<p>The only thing I have for sale at the moment are web server accounts, so I created three posts on the <a href=\"http://blog.brytenet.com/\">BryteNet blog</a> describing the three web hosting packages <a href=\"http://brytenet.com/\">BryteNet</a> currently offers. I tagged all posts with the keyword <code>listing</code> as well as some additional keywords. After that I signed up at Edgeio, claimed my blog and noticed that the posts were already appearing on the site, including a thumbnail made from the image I used in the post. Though they offer the possibility to encode the list price in the blog post as well, I had not mentioned the price, so I edited my Edgeio entries to list the corresponding price. Conclusion: it is very easy to get listed on Edgeio.</p>\n<p>After that I went to the customer side of Edgeio, to see how my listings would appear. One great feature of Edgeio is that you can enter your location, and it will filter the listings based on the distance you have chosen with an AJAX slider. I started by putting the slider on 'Lleida' to see only listings from my home town. As expected, there are only a handful of bloggers here, only my own listings showed up.</p>\n<p>I moved the slider up to 'Catalonia'. To my surprise, I found that only one other Catalan blogger uses Edgeio, offering jobs in Barcelona. There are quite some bloggers in Catalonia, but apparently none of them has found Edgeio yet. I continued to 'Spain' finding three more offers, bringing the total on an amazing eight!</p>\n<p>It is clear that Edgeio is not ready for prime time yet. Though it is easy to get listed, not many bloggers use the service, and therefore it is not worth the effort at this moment to search for listings on Edgeio.</p>\n",

The old site had been created in a couple of minutes 'just to have something', and never changed afterwards. It was really time for a complete site overhaul. When planning the <a href=\"/2006/01/a_little_update/\">datacenter move</a>, I decided not to restore the old site, but to put a simple page with the main properties of the hosting packages and contact information instead. That gave me the chance to built the new site properly.</p>\n<h3>ClientExec</h3>\n<p>My first concern were the existing users of the server. I quickly installed <a href=\"http://www.clientexec.com/\">ClientExec</a> and created accounts for all users, so they can manage their helpdesk tickets and billing information. Installation was very easy, and within an hours I had everything set up. I still want to change the templates to fit in the new BryteNet style, but that can wait 'till later. I did modify the template to include the Google Analytics code. After all, I still want to know what is going on…</p>\n<h3>It's a Small Place</h3>\n<p>The next step was to restore the <a href=\"http://blog.brytenet.com/\">BryteNet weblog</a>. Since the new server has Fantastico installed, I only had to fill in some details, and WordPress was installed. I copied the plug-ins I used to the right place and restored the database to get the old content, and I was finished. 29 minutes was all I needed!</p>\n<h3>eZ Publish</h3>\n<p>For the rest of the site I had chosen the <a href=\"http://ez.no/\">eZ Publish</a> CMS. While eZ Publish is probably way too big for such a small site, I wanted to use it for its execllent multi-language support and since it can do literally anything. So I can manage all aspects of the site (product information, contact forms, customer forum,...) with a single tool. eZ Publish also has a weblog module, but for the moment I have chosen to stick with WordPress.<br>\nI had looked at eZ Publish before, and have big plans for it for future projects, but without a concrete implementation, it is difficult to find out what the possibilities and limitations of this CMS are.</p>\n<p>Installation was a breeze, and I have been able to activate the features I wanted to use at the moment. The templating system is very powerful, though I find it still difficult to find the right template when I want to change a part of a page-layout.</p>\n<p>A little disappointment was that eZ Publish is not able to generate friendly URI's when PHP is implemented as CGI rather than with mod_php. For security reasons PHP is run through CGI on the BryteNet servers, resulting in the appearance of <code>index.php?</code> in the middle of the URI. It is something I will have to live with…</p>\n<p>Another problem I still have to solve is that the automatically generated menus only contain folders, and I haven't found a way yet to include links outside eZ Publish in the menu. I have found something on the subject in the eZ forums, and will tackle this problem soon enough.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>The next big thing I am going to work on is to give BryteNet an unique face. At the moment the three components of the BryteNet site (eZ Publish, ClientExec and WorkPress) still use their default design, which I only modified a little bit. I om going to generate a completely new stylesheet for those sites, so they will have more or less the same look. I started my work with designing a new logo, and am now working on the colour scheme. I have some ideas on how the result will be, but am still experimenting with those ideas.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more news…</p>\n",

Fortunately, coming from another EU country I have the privilege to not really need it in daily life, so there was no problem. I can use my Dutch documentation for identify myself.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can't do is to buy expensive goods as a new car or a house. I had forgotten completely about these limitations, until we started <a href=\"/2005/06/car_hunting/\">looking for a new car</a> last summer. We did buy the car on MJ's name, but I decided to go for it again and hope that they would give me a longer lasting residence card. That was in August 2005:</p>\n<p><strong>August</strong><br>\nI started by obtaining the necessary papers and filling them in. I also tried to phone to the immigration office to get an appointment for delivering these papers. After two weeks, I got my appointment, which fortunately was after the business hours of my office.</p>\n<p><strong>September 8</strong><br>\nAfter leaving the office I went to the immigration office to deliver all papers I had prepared: a special form, copies of my passport, copies of my current, expired, residence card, copies of my last salary statement, an extract from my record in the town hall…</p>\n<p>Fortunately I had understood the cryptic instructions correctly, and all papers were in order. They told me that they were going to study my request, which was going to take them a full month!</p>\n<p><strong>November 9</strong><br>\nTime to find out whether they had approved my request. Unfortunately, this can't be done with an appointment, so you simply had to queue up at the immigration office. I told my boss that I was going to arrive late, and joined the queue two hours before the office was going to open. I only had about 20 people in front of me. I already knew from last time that I would have to spend the whole morning in the queue if I would not be there before they open their doors. After spending three hours on the street, and waiting 20 minutes more inside the office, I finally got a bunch of papers back; my request had been approved. I had to go to the bank to pay the administration costs and then to the police office to get my residence card. I payed directly, and decided to visit the police the next day, since the queue was too big already.</p>\n<p><strong>November 10</strong><br>\nI told my boss that I would arrive late again, and joined the queue 90 minutes before opening time; the queue at the police station is smaller. This time I only had 12 people in from of me. After waiting two hours on the street, I was allowed to enter to show the papers I received at the immigration office and place my signature and fingerprint on a special form so they can create my residence permit. They need one full month for doing this.</p>\n<p><strong>December 30</strong><br>\nBecause of the cold and the amount of work I had in December, I didn't go to pick up my residence permit until three weeks later. Once again I told my company that I would arrive late and once again I had to queue on the street, but this time only 45 minutes. Almost five months after filling in the forms I finally received a little card, which fortunately is valid until 2010.</p>\n<p>Renewing my residence permit has cost me €7, but most of all a lot of precious time. I spent about 6 hours waiting in queues on the street, 45 minutes in queues inside offices, and have been out of office during 3 hours. To me that sounds like I have wasted a lot of time for a simple administrative request. I mainly have been transporting papers from home to one office, and from one office to another; something which could easily have been done by mail. I know that I have to show up in person to get an identification document, but does this have to be for each and every step??? And why do they need a full month to check my history and approve my request and a full month to print out a little plastic credit-card sized pass???</p>\n<p>As most of you know, I hate paperwork.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Recently there has been a lot of attention for web statistics: first <a href=\"http://www.haveamint.com/\">Mint</a> was launched, introducing design and AJAX to web statistics. Soon after that, old-timer NedStat got bought by <a href=\"http://www.webstats4u.com/\">WebStats4U</a>, which lost most of its clients by adding unwanted advertising to sites using the NedStat counter. And last week Google re-launched <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analyitics/\">Google Analytics</a>, previously known as Urchin. There is a lot going on in a market just as old as the Internet.</p>\n<p>As long as people have created web pages, they have been interested in knowing who is visiting their pages. Most web statistics packages already exist for years, and the only changes they have made to their products are the inclusion of new browser detection and more advanced bot filtering. And the inclusion of RSS readers of course.</p>\n<p>The first statistics I ever used was the NedStat counter. I only had to place an image on my home page, and NedStat would tell me the referrer pages, countries, and browsers. Ver neat!</p>\n<p>Then I moved to another hosting provider, which gave me access to the server logs. I installed <a href=\"http://awstats.sourceforge.net/\">AWStats</a> and got <a href=\"/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com\">incredible statistics</a>. Now I can see which search bots spidered my site, which file types are more popular, and which files are missing (404 errors). It is all in the server logs!</p>\n<p>And now I am playing with <a href=\"http://google.com/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a>. Google's application does not use my server logs, but require me to add a piece of JavaScript to each page. The results are once again a step up from what I had: Google does not only show technical reports, but also has <em>views</em> for marketers and executives, showing things like ROI and tracking your <em>goals</em>.</p>\n<p>As a technology-oriented person, I first set the <em>webmaster view</em> as my default view. But Google's webmaster view gives me less information than AWStats. It does not tell me about 404 errors, it does not show me bandwidth numbers, it does not show me login names.… The other views in Analyze are great, and very useful when managing my sites, but I do miss webmaster information.</p>\n<p>I wish it would be possible to ‘enrich’ the data Google collects with my server log files, <a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com/\">FeedBurner </a> reports, etc. With <a href=\"http://google.com/base/\">Google Base</a> they laid the foundation for adding content, they only have to implement in into analyze.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/b1e6908e1e.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Google Analytics\" />\n",

Not only have they <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/?p=36\">stopped accepting new signups</a>, but they also don't allow existing users to add new website profiles.</p>\n<p>After the launch I managed to get signed up, and submitted one of my sites to evaluate Google Analytics. Today, about a week after my signup, Google Analytics finally shows me the results. And I like it a lot! So I want to add Google Analytics to my other sites.</p>\n<p>In the Website Profiles screen I read: <em>To track another website with Analytics, click the 'Add Website Profile' link</em>, but there is no such link in that screen. The help function directs me to the signup screen with the message that they do not accept new signups. What to do?</p>\n<p>I loaded the Website Profiles page in my favourite HTML editor, and find the following code:</p>\n\n<code>\n&lt;!--\n&lt;td class=\"list_control_cell\" align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"plus\"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=\"admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX\" class=\"normal\"&gt;Add Website Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n--&gt;\n</code>\n\n<p>They simply commented out the ‘Add Website Profile’ button! I open the page linked in the code, and Google adds my new website profile without any problem! So to add another website profile, you only have to log-in at Google Analytics and go to the following URL, replacing the XXXXXX by your own user number:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX\">https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX</a></p>\n",

So I checked the manufacturer's web site top see where I could buy it. After phoning all possible shops in Lleida, I reverted to an on-line shop. I looked at the available options and choose the <a href=\"http://tecnologia.carrefour.es\" rel=\"nofollow\">biggest company</a>. That turned out to be my biggest mistake:</p>\n<p>On <strong>October 24</strong> I connected to their site, found my item and saw that they had it on stock. The site mentioned a delivery time of 7 days, which was fine, since I needed it in 14 days.</p>\n<p><strong>October 25</strong><br>\nI received an e-mail confirming my order, after one day!, and a request for a copy of my identification card. Of course I immediately sent this.</p>\n<p><strong>October 28</strong><br>\nI checked the order status on the web, since I had not received a confirmation of reception of my message. The status mentioned ‘missing information’, so I sent an e-mail asking for the current status.</p>\n<p><strong>October 31</strong><br>\nI still hadn't heard anything, and started to become a little bit nervous. So I phoned their customer support. They told me that there was a delay, and they were waiting for their supplier to deliver the goods. They could not explain me why the item was shown to be in stock when I made my order.</p>\n<p><strong>November 2</strong><br>\nI received an e-mail from them, telling me that there had been an ‘incident’. I phoned them and asked them whether they would be able to deliver the item on time, since I needed it in 6 days. They assured me that it would not be a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>November 3</strong><br>\nI would not let them forget me, so I phoned again. They told me that they had the item in their central warehouse, and that it was now passing quality control. They should be able to send it me in one week. I patiently explained them that I really need the item in a few days. The nice guy one the other side said that he understood me and that he would pass a message to the quality control department. I expected that it would be possible to ship it to me on the next day, but told me to phone again.</p>\n<p><strong>November 4</strong><br>\nI faithfully phoned again, hoping that they'd been able to send me my device. But instead of that, the nice lady tells me that they can not deliver within the next two weeks. Besides that, she tells me that there has not been noted anything about my phone call the day before! I explain once more that I really need the device, and that they'd promised me that it would be possible to deliver it on time, but she says that there is nothing she can do. I cancel my order…</p>\n<p>Only little time left, so all I can do is find a shop that has the device in stock and pick it up personally. I start with the big outlets in Barcelona, and after phoning 7 of them I am able to reserve my item. I hop in the car, drive 160 kilometres, pay some money —hé, this shop is even cheaper than what I found on Internet!— and drive home happily. I promise everybody that I won't buy anything from Carrefour!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Though RSS feeds are still only used by the ‘<em>lucky few</em>’, I discovered several phases of RSS reading behaviour:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>In <strong>phase 1</strong> you discover RSS. You are very enthusiastic about having the possibility to see all the news from your favourite resources in one place. When visiting a web site you first look for the orange XML or RSS icon to subscribe. People in phase 1 typically subscribe to 1-50 feeds. You feel very efficient, since all news automagically appears in your feed reader; you've saved yourself hours of useless browsing;</li>\n    <li>After a while you realize that there is a lot more out there: your 50 feeds are not even the top of the iceberg. You have entered <strong>phase 2</strong>. Once in while you find an interesting post outside your feeds, but since the rest of the posts from this author are about his cats you decided not to subscribe. Since you don't want to miss the good posts you set up some ‘search feeds’: <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/\">Technorati</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pubsub.com/\">PubSub</a>, <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com/\">Feedster</a>, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> and friends search the blogsphere for your interest, and automatically notify you. You spend hours tweaking your queries, since you don't want to miss anything. All feeds are nicely organized with a separate folder per subject. You are now checking over 100 feeds on a daily basis;</li>\n    <li>What started with 5 minutes every day, now cost you over an hour. And you can't skip a single day, since that will cost you two hours next day. <strong>Phase 3</strong> is hard work, with an ever increasing number of feeds to read. <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/30.html#a8331\">Robert Scoble mentioned reading 900+ feeds</a>! You know that something has to happen, so you start wielding out your feeds. You unsubscribe feeds of old contacts, feeds about subjects you are no longer interested in, feeds of dead sites… You also put a break on the new feeds you subscribe to. You create a '‘<em>probation</em>’ folder for new feeds, and selectively promote feeds to your main folders. Despite all these efforts you don't feel like you're in control: you are juggling instead;</li>\n    <li>Usually external influences force you into <strong>phase 4</strong>. You simply don't have the time anymore to spend hours a day reading. There are two ways to deal with phase 4: people who go the drastical way simply delete all their feeds, except for the 10 feeds that really matter. After all, if something really important happens everybody will write about it within a few hours. The trick is to pick out the relevant feeds publishing all the news you are interested in.\nOther people are more careful, and simply regroup their feeds by reading frequency: the 10 feeds to be read daily, about 50 feeds to be read once a week if you have time, and many feeds more just in case you want to read them on a bored Sunday afternoon. Reading is a pleasure again, and you feel in control knowing that you can't possibly read everything out there but won't miss any important news.</li>\n    <li>In <strong>phase 5</strong> you see the light! Imagine an army of professional editors searching all available news, and selecting the best pieces. Even better, they publish their results on a handy paper based format called tabloid, which you can take with you wherever you want. And finally, you will be interrupted only once a day.</li>\n</ol>\n\n[Insert fancy graph here]\n\nInspired by Jason Kottke, I entered phase 4 today. I regrouped all my feeds, and reduced the number of feeds in Bloglines. Furthermore I told Bloglines to notify me only when new items appear in my 'top' folder. The first result has been amazing. I had a busy day, so only read my top feeds. I still have a feeling of what is going on whithout having to spend a lot of time reading.\n",

This encourages him to respond promptly to your needs, and it keeps you from waiting at the bar. A pre-tip is always at least 5 dollars (and more often 10 or above, depending on how crowded or upscale the bar is). Despite the amount, it should not comprise the whole of your tipping. One dollar for every 2 drinks afterward is typically sufficient to maintain their interest.\n\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat a huge bullshit!!!

Then the shepherd says: “If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my animal?”\n\n“OK, why not.” answered the young man.\n\n“Clearly, you are a consultant.” said the shepherd.\n\n“That's correct.” says the yuppie, “but how did you guess that?”\n\n“No guessing required.” answers the shepherd. “You turned up here although nobody called you. You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and you don't know crap about my business… Now give me back my dog.”\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Some weeks ago, we decided to change mobile provider. We have a contract with Telefonica Movistar, but most people we phone with are at Amena. We did some calculation and came to the conclusion that we could save on our bill by changing to Amena as well.</p>\n<p>This weekend we finally found the time to head to the Amena office, and we explained out plans. The nice lady in the shop asked us some questions on our phone behaviour, who, when and how much, and she explained us about all the possibilities of the different packages. We made some quick estimations and selected the ‘right’ package.</p>\n<p>Then the more important question came. Carriers earn so much money with all their inflated rates, that they can give away expensive toys. We could choose a new phone! MJ had prepared herself, and knew what her demands were: she wanted the cheapest phone that could flip open. Until now she always had candy-bar phones, but now she wanted clamshell. All other functions did not matter, since she only use the device for phoning and sending SMS messages. Her choice was the NEC e242.</p>\n<p>Of course, as a reader of mobile expert <a href=\"http://russellbeattie.com/notebook/\">Russell Beattie</a>, I know that there is more. Russ has the most incredible applications and uses for his mobiles, and it seems that he uses his mobile for everything I still use a PC for. But his phones are, even after the carrier discount, so incredibly expensive that it would take me years to earn that back with the cheaper rate of Amena. I guess Russ lives in another realm, but most people here choose between the five cheapest models. So I set my mind together, and thought logically. I don't phone a lot, I use SMS even less, and once in a while I use WAP to spend some dead time. Basically, any phone would be enough. But hey, I am a gadget freak, so I should have something additional to wish for, right? Maybe I need a camera on my phone, to update my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/\">photo page</a> more often. That's it! I looked around, and saw a nice and cheap Samsung phone that according to the specs had a camera. I asked if I could see it, and fell in love with the device. Cool design, very light weight (they show the phones without batteries), but… without camera. I asked the friendly lady if she could show me the camera, but no, they'd made an error in the specs. So I took the cheapest camera phone they had: the NEC e242.</p>\n<p>Now we have to find a way to keep our new phones separated!</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/e87aa34cbc.png\" width=\"193\" height=\"311\" alt=\"NEC e242\" />\n",

The trigger was the article <a title=\"Stinky links\" href=\"http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/02/stinky_links.html\">Stinky links</a> by Matt Haughey. At that moment I had just <a title=\"Feeds outsourced\" href=\"/2005/02/feeds_outsourced/\">created my FeedBurner feed</a> combining my posts with my Flickr photo's and my linkdump, and I knew that I had done something wrong. Readers following me because of my Movable Type writings are probably not interested in my holiday photo's, and people who want to know about my life abroad don't want to be bothered by my link dump. This site has a lack of focus, and I only made it worse.</p>\n<p>The feed readers have the biggest problem, since they don't see the context of each entry. On the home page, my ‘<em>normal</em>’ entries take up the bulk of the space, the links are shown in the sidebar, and the latest photo is shown in the sidebar as well. People who read my feed, don't see the context; the three content types appear in exactly the same way. To solve this, I am going to offer three more feeds: one for my weblog, one for the links and one for the photos. They will be added to the current everything-in-one feed, to give my readers more choice.</p>\n<p>Once the biggest problem has been solved, I want to restructure the links section. My main problem is the category structure, since I find it increasingly difficult to correctly place the items. I have to review the existing categories and their items, and will probably start using a tree structure with sub-categories.</p>\n<p>Next, I want to split the weblog part in two parts: a web–tech site and a personal site.</p>\n<p>First I will have to find out how to move certain categories from one weblog to another, but a little bit of SQL-fu should do, right? To link everything together I would like to change my homepage to a gateway to the different parts of the Brain tags empire. I guess this would also be the right moment for a new stylesheet, as I am getting fed up with light blue as well.</p>\n<p>Once all that work has been done I want to start a new site, focused on a subject I work on every day, but which does not show up often on weblogs: point of sale software and hardware. I still have to work out my ideas on this subject, and I want to talk it over with some people, since it comes awfully close to a business weblog, but I think it would add something to the current blogosphere.</p>\n<p>These are my ideas on the near future of Brain Tags. What is your opinion? Am I right, or should I go in another direction? I would like to hear and read your opinions.</p>\n<p><strong>[Update 2005.02.17]</strong>: The first step has been taken. I added a new feed for the photo's: <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainpics\">http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainpics</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "For people who don't know where Lleida is: it lies about 160 km south-west of Barcelona, in the centre of the Segre valley, surrounded by hills. These hills make that Lleida usually is free of wind, which has great influence on the weather in Lleida.\n\nIn summer, the lack of wind makes it 5-10°C hotter than e.g. Barcelona, with weeks of 40°C. The inhabitants prefer to spend their free time in the nearby pyrenees or beaches, which have a more pleasant temperature. As a result, Lleida turns into an empty ghost town in summer.\n\nIn winter, the lack of wind together with the lower temperatures create a dense fog, which stays for many days. At this moment we haven't seen a single ray of sun during almost two weeks. The frustrating of the fog is that is is very local. 20km outside of Lleida, in any direction, the sun is shining each day, and the temperature is 15-20° higher! Every day the news shows a clear wheather map, with one small white dot about 160 km south-west of Barcelona. :-(\n\nWe desperately want a little bit of wind, which will blow away the fog and show us that the sun still exists. If not, we will leave town in the weekend to get some sun and leave Lleida as a ghost town just like in summer.\n",

In my opinion Skype is just another IM client. I don't want to have yet another client, I only want that the existing clients work together. Of course, I don't have five applications running, I use <a href=\"http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/\">Trillian</a>, but it does open five network connections over different ports.</p>\n<p>For the moment, you can Skype me at <strong>icg-jeroen</strong>.

Previously I have been looking at <a href=\"http://www.mamboserver.com/\">Mambo Open Source</a>, which is very easy to use, but has no fine-grained control; I just want to decide what HTML elements are used in templates. eZ Publish does give me this low-level control, but at a price: template design is more complicated.</p>\n<p>Still I guess that I am willing to invest the time to learn the template scripting language, since eZ Publish has many benefits. The biggest benefit is that it can handle everything I do with external scripts: searching, guest book, forum, … Secondly, its multi-language implementation is great; the properties of each object can be entered in several languages, which will be shown to the visitor depending on the site access used.</p>\n<p>I still have to play around a lot more to get to know its possibilities better, but I certainly have a very good feeling about this software.</p>\n",

All our family and friends here have a DVD player. Videotape is dead; DVD is the current device to use. It is almost impossible to rent a recent movie on tape. However, <strong>none</strong> of the Dutch people I have recently spoken have a DVD player! This includes my parents and my sister, probably the persons that are the most interested in our recordings.</p>\n<p>This weekend I will have to spend some time to copy the DVD contents to tape, so I will be able to show them our adventures in Thailand when we visit them in November.</p>\n<p>I am wondering whether Spain really is more technically advanced than the Netherlands (who would have expected that?), whether my friends and family here are more gadget freaks than the people we know in the north of Europe, or whether I simply did not speak to the right people in the Netherlands.

Until some years ago, they had a nice web site with plastic ducks and other toys as decoration. I made this site using Microsoft Frontpage, and maintained it for some years. It contained stories about the activities of this club, which had its highlight in 2000, with an appearance in the Dutch men magazine the <em>Panorama</em> and the production of their CD <em>Dagobert, de heerser hier</em>. Shortly after, the site disappeared, and the club became dormant.</p>\n<p>Last week I accidentally found the text published in the Panorama, and thought that it was a pity that the history of the DDC is not available on the internet.

I quickly installed <a href=\"http://www.mamboserver.com/\">Mambo Open Source</a> on my server, created a new subdomain, configured Mambo and copied the texts into new entries. And there it is: the <a title=\"Dooie Donders Club\" href=\"http://ddc.braintags.com/\">DDC</a> is back!!!</p>\n<p>At the moment is a pretty default Mambo site, but I plan to make some custom templates to give the site some Dooie Donders sauce.</p>\n",

It was developed as a measure against comment spam, and made available in version 3.0 of MT. After TypeKey was released I changed my templates to include this system. I do not force commenters to use TypeKey, since my spam problem is not <em>that</em> big.</p>\n<p>This was in May. Now after some months more, I have some observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Besides me, only <del>one</del>two commenters used TypeKey to comment on this site;</li>\n<li>No other MT–powered site I comment on has TypeKey activated;</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?&q=typekey%20profile%20page%20-site:typekey.com\">Google search</a> on the default TypeKey comment link — TypeKey Profile Page — returns only 21000 hits. So only 21000 pages on the whole web have TypeKey authenticated comments — remember that some sites have many pages, with many posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me it looks like TypeKey is not used a lot.</p>\n<h2>Why can that be?</h2>\n<p>I think the main reason is that most of the sites using Movable Type never update their templates. They might update to a newer version of MT, but leave their templates alone. And they are right in doing so; I remember that it was quite a puzzle to add the TypeKey code to my template.</p>\n<h2>So TypeKey is a failure?</h2>\n<p>After only four months, it is very early to make this kind of conclusions. Every new site that starts using MT will probably have TypeKey activated, so I expect more and more sites to use is. And when the base grows, other sites might benefit more from this service as well.</p>\n",

I know many people are stuck with Microsoft Outlook because their company uses an Exchange server, but that is not the case with me; I am free to choose. I use Microsoft Outlook because it allows me to do some things I can't accomplish with other tools, even though there are many things I don't like about Outlook.</p>\n<p>The main feature that has become indispensable for my is the fact that I can adjust any view to my needs. I have a huge list of contacts, which I have grouped in two levels (country and company). That way I can quickly find contact information. Unfortunately, when I select a contact from a new message window, all I have is a huge flat list of contacts. Another feature I use frequently us the ability to add fields to items. All my task fields have an additional field called 'project', where I put the name of the project this task belongs to. If I group my tasks by project I have a good overview off all pending items per project.</p>\n<p>The features mentioned above are essential for my functioning in the office. Some other features are simply handy to have. For example, conditional formatting allows me to change the <em>view</em> of an item, so that I can see quickly which items have to be processed today or in the coming week, and which items are in progress.</p>\n<p>As bloated as Outlook may be (partly fixed by some add-ons), I haven't found a better PIM.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "More and more people are buying digital cameras; I even read that the digital camera sales outnumber the traditional film cameras nowadays. I am very happy with my Canon film camera, but after I have been playing with my parents' new Sony digital camera last week I wondered whether a digital camera would be something for me. Of course as a gadget it would most certainly be welcome, but as a replacement for my current film camera it will need to add much additional benefits. So I made a little comparison:\n\n<h2>Pro digital:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Electronic format</strong>\nLogically, digital cameras store photographs in a digital format. This makes it very easy to save them on your PC.</li>\n    <li><strong>Easier handling</strong>\nRelated to the digital format, photographs taken with a digital camera are much easier to publish to the internet, to e-mail to your friends and relatives and to catalogue. Besides that you can easily retouch them using graphical editing software.</li>\n    <li><strong>No film rolls</strong>\nSince you don't need to buy film rolls, the costs per photograph will drop significantly.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cheaper workflow</strong>\nWith a digital camera you work different. You shoot your pictures, delete the ones you don't like, store them on you PC and maybe you will print your best pictures. This is a very cheap process.</li>\n    <li><strong>Quantity gives quality</strong>\nBecause the workflow is so cheap, you generally make many more images. This has two big benefits for the image quality: first you simply have a bigger chance making a photograph at the right place and the right time and secondly the more pictures you make, the more experienced you become. Professional photographers use the same tactic, but using film makes it way too expensive for amateur photographers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Pro film:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Higher resolution</strong>\nIt is difficult to compare two completely different techniques, but in general film cameras have a much higher resolution. In digital cameras the important parameter is the number of Megapixels — even though the sensor size is more important — so experts have been trying to calculate this number for film cameras. Results vary, but most conclude that film cameras have a resolution between 15 and 25 Megapixels.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bigger enlargements</strong>\nThe quality of enlargements is another feature in which the traditional camera beats the newcomers. A photograph made with a film camera can easily be enlarged to 40 by 50 centimetres, while a digital photograph will start losing quality at 20 by 25 cm.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cheaper cameras</strong>\nFilm cameras cost only a fraction of their digital equivalents; sometimes they are even 90% cheaper.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dynamic range</strong>\nDigital photo chips have limits in dynamic range; at a certain moment a change in subject brightness won't result in a change in image brightness anymore. Films do not have this hard limit, but rather become less and less sensitive. The dynamic range of films is larger than the dynamic range of photo chips.</li>\n    <li><strong>Proven technology</strong>\nFilm cameras on the market now do not differ much from those on the market five years ago. In general you buy a camera and use it until it stops working. A digital camera however, is new technology that is still being developed. You new 6 megapixel camera will be considered old within a year. I don't know anybody who is still using his one megapixel camera he bought two years ago, but I know several people still using a film camera they bought over a decade ago.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn short, digital cameras give you ease of use and electronic access to your photographs, while film cameras give you quality and are cheaper. The choice is up to you. For me it is not so important having a digital photograph — though I would like to publish more photo's on this site. On a cold Sunday in winter, I like to grab a photo album and browse through the images on my sofa. I don't think I can have that same feeling sitting behind my computer.

Unlike many others who installed this version, I was fully aware that this developer edition could have some problems with plug-ins. Here are my findings of the first days playing around.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dashboard<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The first screen of the MT interface clearly shows a new item: the Movable Type News box. This box syndicates news from the Movable Type web site. Since I prefer to read my news in my feed reader, I immediately <!-- raw HTML omitted -->removed this box<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Another thing changed in the main screen is the direct access to some weblog features. The 2.x versions had for each weblog links to create a new entry and to enter the entries list. Now you can also access the comments list, the templates list and the weblog configuration screen. The one thing I am missing here is the upload file feature, since I assume that bloggers will more often upload an image than tinker with their templates.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edit Entry<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Also the Entry Edit screen has some —minor— modifications. It is now possible to specify the entry date &amp; time the moment you create a new entry. In the older versions you first had to save your entry to modify the publishing time. That leaves only one feature that cannot be modified in new entries: the multiple categories.</p>\n<p>Another change is that the edit buttons now also work in Mozilla based browsers, but only for the entry body. If you use the extended entry field, you still have to enter the HTML code yourself.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The comments list is new and handy feature to manage your comments.

				"content_text": "Four days ago I upgraded the motor of this site to Movable Type version 3.0D — the D is for Developer edition. Unlike many others who installed this version, I was fully aware that this developer edition could have some problems with plug-ins. Here are my findings of the first days playing around.\n\n<strong>Dashboard</strong>\n\nThe first screen of the MT interface clearly shows a new item: the Movable Type News box. This box syndicates news from the Movable Type web site. Since I prefer to read my news in my feed reader, I immediately <a title=\"Brain Tags: Remove Movable Type News box\" href=\"/archives/2004/05/remove_movable_type_news_box/\">removed this box</a>.\n\nAnother thing changed in the main screen is the direct access to some weblog features. The 2.x versions had for each weblog links to create a new entry and to enter the entries list. Now you can also access the comments list, the templates list and the weblog configuration screen. The one thing I am missing here is the upload file feature, since I assume that bloggers will more often upload an image than tinker with their templates.\n\n<strong>Edit Entry</strong>\n\nAlso the Entry Edit screen has some —minor— modifications. It is now possible to specify the entry date &amp; time the moment you create a new entry. In the older versions you first had to save your entry to modify the publishing time. That leaves only one feature that cannot be modified in new entries: the multiple categories.\n\nAnother change is that the edit buttons now also work in Mozilla based browsers, but only for the entry body. If you use the extended entry field, you still have to enter the HTML code yourself.\n\n<strong>Comments</strong>\n\nThe comments list is new and handy feature to manage your comments. You can see the details and the status of the last comments, and open them from that screen. You can filter comments on e-mail, name and IP address, but unfortunately not on status. I don't receive many comments, but I assume that more popular sites would love to see only the comments that are pending for approval.\n\n<strong>Trackback</strong>\n\nIn my definition, trackbacks are nothing more than comments on my entries left on other sites. I would like to treat trackbacks in exactly the same way as comments, but unfortunately trackbacks do not have status information.\n\n<strong>Plug-ins</strong>\n\nOf the 13 plug-ins I use for this site, I removed two after upgrading.\n<a title=\"MT-Blacklist: The collective deep breath\" href=\"http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2004/05/the_collective_deep_breath\">MT-Blacklist is not compatible with MT3.0</a>, so I am removing comment spammers by hand again.\n\nThe Optional-Redirect plug-in is not necessary anymore, since <a title=\"David Raynes: Optional-Redirect is of no use in MT 3.0\" href=\"http://www.rayners.org/2004/05/17/optionalredirect_is_of_no_use_in_mt_30.php\">the same can be achieved in MT 3.0</a> by <code>no_redirect=\"1\"</code>.\n\nAll other plug-ins work the same way as before.\n\n<strong>Individual Archive template</strong>\n\nMost of my time went into trying to adjust the individual archive template. There have been many changes to this template to incorporate the TypeKey service, but I have not yet been able to get them to work when served as XHTML 1.1 with MIME type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. The smallest problem was to validate the template as XHTML 1.1. The new code uses some <code>name</code>s, which I changed into <code>id</code>s, and I had to edit <code>lib/MT/Template/Context.pm</code> so it won't use <code>valign</code> and <code>border</code> anymore -- look at line 1476.\n\nA bigger problem is the JavaScript. Things like <code>document.comments_form.email.value</code> is easy enough changed into <code>document.getElementById('email').value</code>, but I don't know how to fix <code>document.write</code> so it works both on <code>text/html</code> as on <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.\n\nThe last problem I have with my template is that it shows the wrong comment form; the one that is normally used when TypeKey authentication is obligatory. I still have to find out what is going wrong here.\n",

As a result, we were already tired before the show started, and looked very jealously at all consultants freshly arriving at the Microsoft stand and finding their cup of coffee already prepared.\nLike I already said, our stand was situated in a specialized POS corner, so the big public did probably not pass our stand.

In the weekend, many students and families visited the show, which did not bring us many contacts.

On Wednesday the only visitors to the show were some teenagers begging for goodies, so it was very quiet. This made the Wednesday a perfect day to visit other exhibitors, and they also visited us.\nWhat I really missed at the CeBIT was the new technology buzz.

Notice that this stylesheet is XHTML1.1 ready, since it also styles the <code><html></code> element. You only need to copy the file to your server and your site is completely LOAF-compliant.\n\nTo use the LOAF CSS implementation on your site, follow the steps below:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Download the <a href=\"http://braintags.com/images/loaf.css\">LOAF CSS file</a>;</li>\n    <li>Replace the stylesheet for your site with the contents of the file you just downloaded (MT users: read the <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_templates.html#default%20templates\">instructions</a> on the Movable Type site).</li>\n    <li>That's all!</li>\n</ul>\n",

I only needed to copy the main <code>awstats.pl</code> file, the <code>lib</code> directory and the <code>icons</code> directories, and could use the existing configuration file (after changing the <code>DirCgi</code> parameter) to have everything working.</p>\n<p>So now everybody can <a title=\"Statistics of braintags.com\" href=\"/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com\">check my access statistics</a>!!!</p>\n<p>Maybe someday I will create an <em>About this site</em> page, on which I will put a permanent link to my statistics. Some people put this link on their home page, but in my opinion this feature is of no use to the general visitor, and only adds bloat to the home page.</p>\n",

By default, MT keeps them separated, providing a list of comments and a list of trackbacks. In my point of view, comments and trackbacks are basically the same, but in different places. Therefore, I prefer to have a single comments list, with both the comments residing on my site as the comments written on other sites.

They ask site owners to place a button on their site, linked to a page explaining why other browsers are better than IE.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Although I agree with them that IE is quickly becoming a dinosaur, I don&rsquo;t think that a button will let many users change their browser.

Something as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->position:fixed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> CSS property can serve for this purpose, for example for creating a floating navigation bar which will always be visible on the top of the screen.

				"content_text": "A month ago, I wrote about the <a title=\"Braintags: Internet Explorer\" href=\"/2003/06/internet_explorer/\">shortcomings of Internet Explorer</a> and how this might stop innovation on the Internet in the coming years.\n\nAll over the web, people have expressed their worries, and a lot of web designers are afraid to have to deal with an obsolete browser for many many years. And of course, an action has been started to convince users to switch to another browser: <a title=\"Use a Better Browser\" href=\"http://giantfightingrobots.com/betterbrowser.html\">Use a Better Browser</a>. They ask site owners to place a button on their site, linked to a page explaining why other browsers are better than IE.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/8477f2139c.png\" alt=\"Use a better browser\" width=\"90\" height=\"19\" />\n\nAlthough I agree with them that IE is quickly becoming a dinosaur, I don't think that a button will let many users change their browser. However, they <em>will</em> change because of (lack of) features. If other browsers have features IE does not have, users might switch.\n\nTherefore, the best way to convince IE-users to show them the tabbed browser interface and pop-up blocking of Mozilla and create sites using code that is not supported by IE.\n\nOf course, degrade gracefully. Something as the <code>position:fixed</code> CSS property can serve for this purpose, for example for creating a floating navigation bar which will always be visible on the top of the screen. IE users will simply have to scroll up to navigate (as always), while visitors with newer browsers will have the benefits of having the navigation always at hand.\n\nOther features that can be used to create better sites, are described in Eric Meyer's <a href=\"http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/\">css/edge</a>. These won't work on IE, but won't make the page unusable.\n\nSo go ahead, design your pages using the latest coding possibilities, but degrade gracefully!!\n",

				"content_text": "I love technology. I just love it. And I love computers, cellphones, PDA's, digital camera's and other geek toys. The only thing is… I don't have them!!! I used to have some fine toys, but they have been stolen <a title=\"Braintags: Another visit\" href=\"/2003/03/another_visit/\">some months ago</a>.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/51da26d002.png\" alt=\"Palm III\" width=\"179\" height=\"200\" />\nMy biggest proud and useful gadget was my Palm III PDA, shown above. It contained my agenda, addresses of friends, family and clients, books to read at lost moments, games and passwords (encrypted of course!). Without realising it, I used my Palm daily, and was very happy with it. But… no Palm at the moment!\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5908/2021/35b3af6ca8.png\" alt=\"Samsung SGH-N400\" width=\"260\" height=\"210\" />\nThe other gadget I owned was a Samsung SGH-N400 cellphone. I specially liked the design of this phone (by <a href=\"http://www.pininfarina.it/\">Pininfarina</a>). But is was easy to use and had all the functions I need (vibration, WAP, small size, ...). But… no cellphone at the moment!\n\nI do have some computers, three in total. It is not the quality of them but the amount that make them geek toys. My desktop computer is the most advanced of the three, with a Cyrix P-133+ processor and 48Mb of memory. Yes, I know it is not that impressive. But after I reinstalled everything lately it runs faster that the mega computer I use at work. I did keep some room on the harddisk to install Linux to have even more pleasure. But… no Linux at the moment!\n\nYou might think that I must be a sad geek without any toys, but that is certainly not the case. I don't have any toys, because I am looking around to decide what toys I am going to buy. Alright, I could go into a shop and buy the latest and the greates phone, PDA and computer, but that is gonna cost me an awful lot of money.\n\nFirst of all I decided that I don't need a fancy cellphone. If I have time I will buy a prepaid number this weekend, and I will probably start using a second hand phone. For the moment that will be enough, since I don't phone a lot and neither plan to use any other functions.\n\nI will also keep on using my old computer. It is fast enough, and with a little bit of extra memory, a wireless connection to the ADSL router and <a title=\"Gentoo Linux\" href=\"http://www.gentoo.org/\">Linux</a> installed I sure will have lots of pleasure of it.\n\nThat leaves me without PDA. Palm recently released a new model, the <a title=\"Palm Products - Zire 71 Handheld\" href=\"http://www.palm.com/products/handhelds/zire71/\">Zire 71</a>, which kicks ass! It has a built-in camera, so it gives me two toys for the price of one. The only problem is the price, which is around €300.

Wrong! There are a number of reasons why I (and many other people) consider HTML mail harmful:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail wastes bandwidth</strong>\nHTML code adds usually 200% to the size of the message. I know, for your short message this is only a very little bit, but if I have been away for the weekend and find tens of HTML messages I urgently want to read, I get nervous when I am waiting 5 minutes (yes, I am using a slow modem) while it could have been finished within 2 minutes!</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail is more vulnerable for viruses</strong>\nThis is a really important one. By using HTML mail, one of the main security principles are broken: separate code from content. HTML mail (content) can contain scripts (code) that virus writers exploit. Many of the famous Trojan Worms would never have been spread around if people would have used plain text messages by default.</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail can connect to the internet</strong>\nThis is something used a lot in spam. They include an image which is stored on their server and insert it into the message with some kind of parameter. The moment you read the message, the image is fetched from their server, passing the parameter to the sender of the message. The result is that your e-mail address will be listed as ‘verified’ and therefore will receive more spam.</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML incompatibilities</strong>\nMost people who create websites know how difficult it is to create a page that looks alright on all mayor browsers. Guess what? E-mail clients have the same problems! The message that looks perfect in your Outlook Express can look completely different on the computer of your sister, who uses Eudora to read her mail. And there are still people around with mail applications that don't support HTML at all!</li>\n    <li><strong>HTML mail is slow</strong>\nPlain text messages only have to be shown on screen, but ‘rich’ messages need preprocessing. Especially on old computers the difference is very clear. Wait, hasn't your neighbour still got that old-timer Pentium II? Better send him plain text next time, I am sure he will appreciate it! This does not only go for old computers, but more and more people start reading their mail using PDA's or cellphones.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn short: unless you have very good reasons to use HTML mail, I would ask you to send plain text messages. If the appearance of the message is so important, you're probably better off by sending it as a PDF attachment or publishing it on a web page; those media are suited better for this task.\n\nGo ahead, <a title=\"Configuring Mail Clients to Send Plain ASCII Text\" href=\"http://www.expita.com/nomime.html\">configure your mail client to send plain ASCII text</a>.\n",

His plugin lets me publish all kinds of information from BlogShares on my site, but the one thing I have been looking for has not been implemented yet.\n\nSo David, if you read this, could you implement this in your plugin for me, since my programming knowledge is by far not as good as yours:\n\nUsing your plugin it is possible to obtain the URL of each stock's BlogShares page. The only thing that I want is a possibility to remove the string <code>http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=</code>, so that I have the URL of the site in question.\n\nThis allows me to create a list with links to sites I own shares of. As soon as the BlogShares spider visits my site and picks up those links, the total value of the blogs I have shares in will increase, making my shares worth more.\n\nWell, what do you think about this idea? I think a lot of people will use your plugin if you have implemented this option.\n",

I looked around, and indeed somebody had searched our car; the papers in the gloves compartment were in a slightly different place than usual.\n\nI couldn't find anything else, so I started the engine and put the radio to go to work. The weather was beautiful and sunny— dammit! They took my sunglasses!!!!!\n",

Internet was new and after playing with <a href=\"http://www.scn.org/~bkarger/gopher-manifesto\">gopher</a> I installed Mosaic on my Macintosh and made my first page. In fact it was nothing more that a bulleted list with my favourite sites.</li>\n    <li><strong>V2</strong>: In 1997 I bought myself a new computer with modem. With my internet connection came some space on the server for my personal homepage. I installed FrontPage (like everybody in that time), chose a nice theme and typed in my texts. Later I linked my CD database to this site, gaining a lot of links from music lovers.</li>\n    <li>V3: The site you are reading now, created in 2001. In the meantime I had learned that FrontPage creates bloated, non-standard pages, so I created this site as a pure site. Written completely on Notepad. I installed two perl scripts (NewsPro and Image Gallery) to handle the dynamical content, and that's it!</li>\n    <li><strong>V4</strong>: As my sites always have been used mainly for testing purposes, I will go one step further. V4 will be hosted on my own server, and I will probably use the Zope Application Server, with Plone on top of it. Besides my old sites, I will probably continue to write short stories about my life (even though I know that I am not the greatest writer), but I will probably split them into personal and technical stories. The comments feature is almost never used, so I will replace it by a conventional guestbook. I have a lot of other ideas, but I won't bother you with it now...</li>\n</ul>\n\nBesides my personal sites, I have been working on three more sites.

I wasn't really hungry when I went for lunch (understatement), but after lunch I felt just as stuffed as the chicken I had been eating. I was happy to sleep a little after lunch (my father of course continued working), knowing that in the evening we would go to a nice restaurant to eat some more…\n",

Since then, things have settled down, but one thing still is missing: our working room still serves as a storage room, with my old computer packed into boxes.</p>\n<p>Until that moment we both use my (even older) Toshiba Satellite Pro 400 CDT. This computer is not really fast, but in the mean time I have gotten used to it. It&rsquo;s really comfortable working on the sofa, but to connect to internet I have to move to the floor of the hallway. For the moment we have this solution, but sometimes one computer just isn&rsquo;t enough for two people.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I dug up my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> old laptop, a 486 with 8 Mb memory and 525 Mb harddisk, but without CD player. I once installed Windows 98, but it wasn&rsquo;t running perfectly. Besides this, I don&rsquo;t have a licence for this machine, and don&rsquo;t want to buy one. Therefore I decided to install GNU/Linux on it.</p>\n<p>Taken the absence of the CD-player and the minimal hardware, I started looking for a floppy-based distribution. I once used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HAL91<!-- raw HTML omitted --> distribution, but this only runs on a RAM disk, while I want to be able to install it onto my harddisk. Then I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MuLinux<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a tiny single floppy based distribution with the ability to copy the installation to the harddisk, and with some add-on floppies to install additional features like the X-Windows system, Wine, TeX, … It looked promising, so I set to work.</p>\n<p>While the disk images were downloading to my Toshiba laptop, I started the other laptop from a DOS bootdisk to format the harddisk.

				"content_text": "One month ago we moved to our new house. Since then, things have settled down, but one thing still is missing: our working room still serves as a storage room, with my old computer packed into boxes.\n\nUntil that moment we both use my (even older) Toshiba Satellite Pro 400 CDT. This computer is not really fast, but in the mean time I have gotten used to it. It's really comfortable working on the sofa, but to connect to internet I have to move to the floor of the hallway. For the moment we have this solution, but sometimes one computer just isn't enough for two people.\n\nThat's why I dug up my <em>really</em> old laptop, a 486 with 8 Mb memory and 525 Mb harddisk, but without CD player. I once installed Windows 98, but it wasn't running perfectly. Besides this, I don't have a licence for this machine, and don't want to buy one. Therefore I decided to install GNU/Linux on it.\n\nTaken the absence of the CD-player and the minimal hardware, I started looking for a floppy-based distribution. I once used the <a href=\"http://jspiro.tripod.com/linux/hal91.htm\">HAL91</a> distribution, but this only runs on a RAM disk, while I want to be able to install it onto my harddisk. Then I found <a href=\"http://mulinux.sunsite.dk\">MuLinux</a>, a tiny single floppy based distribution with the ability to copy the installation to the harddisk, and with some add-on floppies to install additional features like the X-Windows system, Wine, TeX, … It looked promising, so I set to work.\n\nWhile the disk images were downloading to my Toshiba laptop, I started the other laptop from a DOS bootdisk to format the harddisk. It had quite some bad sectors, but that shouldn't be a big problem. In the mean time the download was finished. I extracted the DOSTOOLS to <code>C:\\mulinux</code> and copied the images (BOOT, WKS, SRV en X11) to the same directory. Next, I runned <code>unpack.bat</code>, which opened the main archive <code>mulinux-13r2.tgz</code>. Then I fired up makefi.bat, which created an installation disk. Since muLinux distribution running from floppy, installation means preparing the floppies. After the installation disk was prepared, I rebooted my Toshiba, after which the installation process prepared the BOOT floppy.\n\nI immediately took this floppy to my old laptop and booted it with it. It booted nicely and started the configuration procedure. The first thing I had to do was configure the swap space. The harddisk was DOS formatted, but I want to install my linux on a ext2 partition. Therefore I decided to boot the machine with only the necessary configuration, after which I should be able to use the linux fdisk utility to partition the harddisk. For the moment I configured the swap space as a file on the DOS partition and continued.\n\nAfter configuring the swap space I had the option to load each of the available add-on disks. After selecting No for each of them, a configuration menu was presented with three options: No additional configuration, a minimal configuration or a custom configuration. I selected the minimal configuration, and Linux continued loading its applications onto the RAM disk.\n\nAt the end I was asked if I wanted to save these settings as default (which I did not since I want to change the partitioning) and then I was offered a tour which I also declined.\n\nFinally I was presented with the prompt, indicating that I could start to work. This prompt is a silly thing, since the multi-user options are on the SRV add-on. Anyway, I enterer root (just for the show) and fired up fdisk.

That will keep me busy for a while…\n",
