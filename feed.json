				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n  When we told our guide that we didn't want to go to all the tourist places he took us instead to the places where they take tourists who say that they don't want to go to tourist places. These places are, of course, full of tourists. Which is not to say that we weren't tourists every bit as much as the others, but it does highlight the irony that everything you go to see is changed by the very action of going to see it, which is the sort of problem which physicists have been wrestling with for most of this century.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ndash; Douglas Adams in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345371984/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0345371984&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=braintags-20\">Last Chance to See</a></p>\n\n<p>I am no scientific in any way, but still remember the importance of the above statement from my chemistry classes. As an example, when you want to test the pH of a liquid using a piece of litmus paper, you have to make sure that the amount of liquid is large enough to eliminate the effects of the pH change inducted by the piece of litmus paper. In other words, using litmus paper to test the pH degree of a drop of liquid has a huge error margin.</p>\n\n<p>I have this principle in mind with most things I measure. The inclusion of a piece of JavaScript on the pages of my web site in order to have Google Analytics collect data about my visitors has an effect on the user experience: the page loads a little bit slower. However, Google&rsquo;s infrastructure is fast enough so that the increase in load time is hardly noticeable.</p>\n\n<h2>URL shorteners</h2>\n\n<p>Many Twitter users also want to measure the efficiency and popularity of their tweets. The most common method of doing this is by using an intermediate server, the &lsquo;URL shortener&rsquo;, which registers each visit to the destination site.</p>\n\n<p>In the first years of Twitter, URL shorteners such as <a href=\"http://bitly.com\">bit.ly</a> were necessary to prevent long URLs from using too many of the available 140 characters in a tweet. However, in 2011Twitter implemented their <strong>own URL shortener</strong> inside their service so that each URL, including the ones passed through another shortener, only use 20 characters. Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>\n\n<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet. Once again, this was true in the past, but nowadays Twitter gives <strong>excellent statistics</strong> about the number of favourites, retweets and answers to each tweet on their <a href=\"https://analytics.twitter.com\">statistics page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest difference between Twitter&rsquo;s own shortener and external services is <strong>transparency</strong>. When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you&rsquo;re linking to if you don&rsquo;t use an external shortener &ndash; and therefore just Twitter&rsquo;s service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <strong>Single Point of Failure</strong> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>\n\n<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <em>expectation</em> was that tweets with shortened links get <strong>clicked less</strong> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>\n\n<h2>Experimenting</h2>\n\n<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code></p>\n\n<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href=\"http://bitly.com/\">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>\n\n<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <a href=\"http://tweko.com\">Tweko</a> service, which was invoked by adding the <code>#tweko</code> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>\n\n<h3>Tweet 1 -- Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\">Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/2iZFFblXsn\">http://bit.ly/1c8gCuw</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/371931328067153920\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Tweet 2 -- No Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\"><p>Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/ekVvviOOni\">http://canasto.es/2010/03/como-g...</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/372006931189481472\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The results</h2>\n\n<p><p>After a few weeks I decided to have a look at the statistics in Google Analytics. I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named &lsquo;TestShortener&rsquo; to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field &lsquo;ad content&rsquo; as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th>Visits</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <tfoot>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total</td>\n      <td>820</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tfoot>\n</table>\n\n<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>\n\n<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href=\"http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95\">calculate</a>:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th># successes</th>\n      <th># trials</th>\n      <th>Confidence interval</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).</p>\n\n<h2>My conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>\n",

Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample's success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.\n\nIn order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href=\"http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95\">calculate</a>:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th># successes</th>\n      <th># trials</th>\n      <th>Confidence interval</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe verdict is that the 'NoShortener' sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).\n\n<h2>My conclusion</h2>\n\nFor me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.\n",

If you want one of these applications to access your Google Account, you must enter an application-specific password, not your Google Account password, when asked for a password.\n</blockquote>\n\nI went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> for iPhone, FlipBook, <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> for iPad, <a href=\"http://www.feedly.com/\">Feedly</a>, <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.\n\n<h3>Does it make sense?</h3>\n\nAfter a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.\n\nI know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google's servers. To me it makes no sense that --even though one application increased its security-- the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.\n\nI finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can't use Google anymore as my <a href=\"http://smarterware.org/6286/how-to-set-up-openid-on-your-own-domain\">OpenID provider</a>, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web --those that require registration-- I want to comment on. Too much of a hassle to be functional...\n",

When he started talking, I remembered how Tim Ferriss also &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; e-mail in his book.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307353133\">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, Tim explains how he only reads his e-mail a few times per day while an autoresponder tells the senders to use the phone instead for more urgent messages. I have read it several times, but I still can&rsquo;t see where the productivity increase comes from. I&rsquo;d rather check my e-mail twice a day to reduce phone calls. In my opinion, phone calls are a bigger time waster that e-mail. When someone phones you, that person decides for you that the issue he is phoning about is at that moment more important than all other issues you are working on. A phone call is almost always an interruption in your workflow, while e-mail is part of the workflow. Of course, there are times when a phone call is justified, for example when a customer is having technical problems that stopped his business. The idea is to use the right tool for the job, and in the past years I have spend quite some time explaining that the phone usually is not the right tool and that e-mail or IM for more time-dependant questions are more adequate.</p>\n\n<p>Using the right tool for the job is exactly why Luis Suárez stopped using e-mail and changed it for instant messaging, wikis, blogs, rss, bookmark services, quickr, etc. In principle I agree with Luis that e-mail is not always the best tool to use, but at this moment there is a scattering problem when using web 2.0 tools. I already noticed this when I try to convince people to stop phoning me and use IM instead. There is a myriad of IM tools and protocols available, and to be able to communicate with all my customers I need ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Messenger, Skype and GTalk. <strong>All of them!</strong> I am a tech savvy guy, so I can handle this (all accounts are nicely accessible from one client: Digsby), but this surely is no option for many other people, who already find it very difficult to install one IM client.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine the same thing happening with all other functions of e-mail. To collaborate on a document there are dozens of services available. Of course I will choose one of them, but will me customer also use that? Of course not, they use Google Docs instead of a wiki. And as I cooperate with more people, my shared work will be shattered across the internet. I remember a customer send me a link to an interesting article, but where is it? I need to maintain a database to know that this particular customer uses Delicious to share bookmarks.</p>\n\n<p>You can say a lot about e-mail. It is not the perfect tool for collaboration or status reporting. <strong>But it is a standard</strong>. Everybody has e-mail, and everybody knows how to use it. And if you work together with many customers, using web 2.0 solutions will not be an option in the majority of cases, until there will be a common protocol or tool such as Digsby for IM that allows people using different services for a functionality to cooperate.</p>\n",

There is a myriad of IM tools and protocols available, and to be able to communicate with all my customers I need ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Messenger, Skype and GTalk. <strong>All of them!</strong> I am a tech savvy guy, so I can handle this (all accounts are nicely accessible from one client: Digsby), but this surely is no option for many other people, who already find it very difficult to install one IM client.\n\nNow imagine the same thing happening with all other functions of e-mail. To collaborate on a document there are dozens of services available. Of course I will choose one of them, but will me customer also use that? Of course not, they use Google Docs instead of a wiki. And as I cooperate with more people, my shared work will be shattered across the internet. I remember a customer send me a link to an interesting article, but where is it? I need to maintain a database to know that this particular customer uses Delicious to share bookmarks.\n\nYou can say a lot about e-mail. It is not the perfect tool for collaboration or status reporting. <strong>But it is a standard</strong>. Everybody has e-mail, and everybody knows how to use it. And if you work together with many customers, using web 2.0 solutions will not be an option in the majority of cases, until there will be a common protocol or tool such as Digsby for IM that allows people using different services for a functionality to cooperate.\n",

The next morning when we came back to finish cleaning we encountered a swimming pool instead of our cleaned floor. <a href=\"http://braintags.com/archives/1998/03/pittig-feestje/\">Oops</a>…\n\nI also went to Africa and visited the very interesting country of Lesotho. Of course, still being a rookie blogger I only <a href=\"/1998/09/kaderschouw/\">slightly mentioned</a> this instead of writing a post with high Google juice. Missed change indeed.\n\nI also had the worst skin problems I remember and had to stay home for several days because <a href=\"/1998/10/ontsteking/\">my face was severely infected</a>. I still don't know what caused it (<a href=\"http://braintags.com/archives/1998/05/\">allergy</a>?, stress?), but fortunately it didn't return after 1998.\n\nThen there were of course some stories about Jong Nederland, such as <a href=\"/1998/09/kaderschouw/\">kaderschouw</a>, the <a href=\"/1998/11/nacht-van-16/\">Night of 16+</a>, planning the <a href=\"/1998/12/brainstormen-en-volleybal/\">EuroContact</a> and the famous <a href=\"/1998/12/brainstormen-en-volleybal/\">volleyball tournament</a> of the Utrecht district.\n\nYou might also be interested in <a href=\"/2007/11/looking-back-at-1997/\">Looking back at 1997</a>.\n",

I am now finishing off the new design, after which we can finally show the world the work we have been doing. Working on a graphical design is quite an adventure for a technical person like me.

Both sites are built on eZ Publish, so I use the experiences on ons site to advance on another. I am also working to leverage some of the karma I got with blogging to new profitable projects under the Brytenet umbrella. You will read more about that when these plans have crystallized a little bit more. Anyway, currently the Brytenet site is off-line while I restructure the content, but before next week I hope to be open for business again.</p>\n\n<h2>A home project</h2>\n\n<p>There is still one room in our house where we didn&rsquo;t do anything since we moved in, the room where our visitors sleep. Those who have visited us can confirm that the beds in that room have had their time. So we are going to use our holiday in November to get rid of the current furniture and paint the room. In the mean time we are already looking for two new beds and a wardrobe to provide our guests with better rest and ourselves with more storage room.</p>\n\n<h2>Teaching sells</h2>\n\n<p>And finally I started an on-line course about making on-line courses (?) called <a href=\"http://teachingsells.com/?ref=ebdbbfb9&amp;pid=c4a0577c\">Teaching Sells</a>, which will probably help me getting all that information I have been absorbing over the past years out of my head and into my wallet.

Furthermore, with the Google Notebook Firefox extension I am able to select a text on a random web page and copy it together with the address of the page to my Notebook.\n\nFrom now on, drafts in my blogging software are actually pieces I already have started to write, which usually are only a few. This set-up keeps things clear, and speeds up my blogging workflow.\n",

And technical departments know that 80% of the problems are caused by only 20% of the clients. This is very interesting information for managers, who can use these numbers to steer their sales and support departments.</p>\n\n<p>But how can we correlate the Pareto numbers for these two departments? Are the 20% that purchase the most the same customers that use most of your organization&rsquo;s resources? Well, experience tells us that this is not the case: there usually are customers buying for huge amounts without ever needing the support department. The two Pareto principle are not correlated, so if we only look at the small group of customers responsible for 80% of the sales, you will find once again that 20% of that group is using 80% of the resources.</p>\n\n<p>As there is no correlation, I can easily divide my customers into four distinct groups:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>\n    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales and using 80% of the resources;</li>\n    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>\n    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales and using 80% of the resources.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I put those four groups in a specific order. The first group is worth the most, as they bring in a lot of money at low costs and the fourth group is the most difficult group.</p>\n\n<p>So should you just drop the customers in the fourth group? Of course not, as we are talking about a principle and not a fixed categorization. If you drop group four, and look again at the numbers, you will see that once again 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales and 80% of the resources are used by only 20% of the clients. Customers who were in to top 20% before, not rank lower simple because you have less customers. If I have 100 clients, there are 20 clients in the top 20%, but if I drop 50 of them, the top 20% will be formed by only 10 customers. Of course, if you have to drop customers, because you haven&rsquo;t got enough resources, make sure you drop clients from the fourth group, as the clients in the other three groups are worth more.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/5f68bb1b9d.png\" width=\"219\" height=\"281\" alt=\"Vilfredo Pareto\" /></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/65c4093238.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"246\" alt=\"Network\" /></p>\n\n<p>More and more bloggers unite in so-called blogging networks. Robert Scoble published a good overview of the most important networks in <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/\">Competitors of PodTech that I love, er, going to the Content Mall</a>. A content mall is the same as a blogging network.</p>\n<p>As I am interested in blogging in general, I have been following various blogging networks for some time. I can clearly see the benefits of blogging networks for the bloggers involved, but have been wondering for a long time what the benefit is for the visitors of a site part of a blogging network. So I posted the following <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164130\">comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is clear that 'content malls' bring in huge benefits for the sites within a mall. They can work together and link to each other to boost PR.</p>\n<p>But what benefit is there for the visitors? Shopping malls bring benefit by sharing a physical space with various stores. After going shopping for clothes I can buy some electronics without having to drive to another place. Very comfortable.</p>\n<p>But when visiting a fashion weblog part of a content mall I can go to the technology weblog of that mall just as fast as I can go to any other techblog. I won't visit the technology weblog because it belongs to a certain group, but rather because I like it in spite of being part of that group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164224\">Answered</a> promptly by Robert self:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By joining a network a blogger/podcaster/videoblogger will probably be able to get paid much more than if he/she tries to do it on his/her own.</p>\n<p>That money might let them quit their jobs (that's what happened to <a href=\"http://GeekBrief.TV\">GeekBrief.TV</a>, for instance) which will enable that person to produce even more content for you. Or, maybe, afford better equipment. Or, maybe be able to afford a trip to more industry conferences where they'll be able to bring you more news and information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Robert completely hits the nail on its head here.

Robert Scoble published a good overview of the most important networks in <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/\">Competitors of PodTech that I love, er, going to the Content Mall</a>. A content mall is the same as a blogging network.</p>\n<p>As I am interested in blogging in general, I have been following various blogging networks for some time. I can clearly see the benefits of blogging networks for the bloggers involved, but have been wondering for a long time what the benefit is for the visitors of a site part of a blogging network. So I posted the following <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164130\">comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is clear that 'content malls' bring in huge benefits for the sites within a mall. They can work together and link to each other to boost PR.</p>\n<p>But what benefit is there for the visitors? Shopping malls bring benefit by sharing a physical space with various stores. After going shopping for clothes I can buy some electronics without having to drive to another place. Very comfortable.</p>\n<p>But when visiting a fashion weblog part of a content mall I can go to the technology weblog of that mall just as fast as I can go to any other techblog. I won't visit the technology weblog because it belongs to a certain group, but rather because I like it in spite of being part of that group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164224\">Answered</a> promptly by Robert self:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By joining a network a blogger/podcaster/videoblogger will probably be able to get paid much more than if he/she tries to do it on his/her own.</p>\n<p>That money might let them quit their jobs (that's what happened to <a href=\"http://GeekBrief.TV\">GeekBrief.TV</a>, for instance) which will enable that person to produce even more content for you. Or, maybe, afford better equipment. Or, maybe be able to afford a trip to more industry conferences where they'll be able to bring you more news and information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Robert completely hits the nail on its head here. What is good for the blogger is good for his/her reader.</p>\n",

Furthermore, AceMoney has been translated into many languages and even loads the local list of banks and categories.\n\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/f8f58e6293.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"144\" alt=\"AceMoney\" />\n",

As you might be worried what is going on here, I deceided to write a little bit about the new fimcap site.</p>\n\n<p>We decided to implement the new site using the eZ Publish CMS, which allows for multi-lingual content and custom defined content types. This flexibility of course has a price: a steep learning curve. The basics are quite simple, but problems start when you want to modify templates. You literally can control everything, but you have to find the right template. Each page is made up from dozens of little templates, each of which can reside in several places.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain that in more detail. If you do a fresh installation, your site is configured to use two sets of templates: <em>standard</em>, which contains some bare-bones unstyled templates that make sure eZ Publish outputs at least something, and <em>base</em>, which adds a little bit of style. Of course, for your own site you want to use your own design, and you can either replace the <em>base</em> design, or add your own design, which is what we did. Now every time a template is called, eZ Publish first looks in the Fimcap design. If it can&rsquo;t find a template, it will search in the <em>base</em> design, and finally it will fall back to the <em>standard</em> design. So if I want to modify a template, I have to search in that order as well to find the currently used template. After a working for some weeks with the template system, I finally got the hang of it, and am able to find the correct templates quickly…</p>\n\n<p>In case you&rsquo;re interested in the progress we&rsquo;re making, have a look at <a href=\"http://new.fimcap.org/\">new.fimcap.org</a>.</p>\n",

This flexibility of course has a price: a steep learning curve. The basics are quite simple, but problems start when you want to modify templates. You literally can control everything, but you have to find the right template. Each page is made up from dozens of little templates, each of which can reside in several places.\n\nLet me explain that in more detail. If you do a fresh installation, your site is configured to use two sets of templates: <em>standard</em>, which contains some bare-bones unstyled templates that make sure eZ Publish outputs at least something, and <em>base</em>, which adds a little bit of style. Of course, for your own site you want to use your own design, and you can either replace the <em>base</em> design, or add your own design, which is what we did. Now every time a template is called, eZ Publish first looks in the Fimcap design. If it can't find a template, it will search in the <em>base</em> design, and finally it will fall back to the <em>standard</em> design. So if I want to modify a template, I have to search in that order as well to find the currently used template. After a working for some weeks with the template system, I finally got the hang of it, and am able to find the correct templates quickly…\n\nIn case you're interested in the progress we're making, have a look at <a href=\"http://new.fimcap.org/\">new.fimcap.org</a>.\n",
