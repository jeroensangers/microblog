However, where the ‚Äò123‚Äô previously was, I now see ‚Äò#+=‚Äô, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign. There it is:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/90237d7715.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"143\" alt=\"iPhone keyboard 3\" /></p>\n\n<p>That was easy and intuitive. Now let&rsquo;s see what usually happens when I try to do the same basic thing on my iPad:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/462719c382.png\" width=\"682\" height=\"270\" alt=\"iPad keyboard 1\" /></p>\n\n<p>Though there are more characters available, the ‚Äò+‚Äô symbol is not there. Yes, I know I can swipe down the ‚Äò√ß‚Äô key, but for the sake of this argument pretend that is not the case, as not all characters are available to swipe down and my fingers fail in swiping far enough about 20% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Just like on the iPhone, I have a button labeled ‚Äò.?123‚Äô to get to the numerical keyboard.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/a1b38ca25e.png\" width=\"682\" height=\"272\" alt=\"iPad keyboard 2a\" /></p>\n\n<p>On the numerical keyboard I once again see the ‚Äò#+=‚Äô button, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/cebc4b53ea.png\" width=\"682\" height=\"271\" alt=\"iPad keyboard 3\" /></p>\n\n<p>And here is my issue, since the ‚Äò+‚Äô button is nowhere to be seen on the third keyboard. What went wrong?\nThe answer is on the second screen, so lets get back:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/7904b61438.png\" width=\"682\" height=\"272\" alt=\"iPad keyboard 2b\" /></p>\n\n<p>The problem is caused by the label of the button which brings us to the special characters keyboard. The button is labeled as ‚Äò#+=‚Äô just like the iPhone, but in this case all three characters shown on the button are already on the previous keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple would simply change the characters shown on the button to characters actually on the third keyboard (I propose ‚Äò&gt;|^‚Äô), my monkey brain would not make the mistake to press it when I&rsquo;m looking for the ‚Äò+‚Äô character.</p>\n",

Yes, I know I can swipe down the ‚Äò√ß‚Äô key, but for the sake of this argument pretend that is not the case, as not all characters are available to swipe down and my fingers fail in swiping far enough about 20% of the time.\r\n\r\nJust like on the iPhone, I have a button labeled ‚Äò.?123‚Äô to get to the numerical keyboard.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/a1b38ca25e.png\" width=\"682\" height=\"272\" alt=\"iPad keyboard 2a\" />\r\n\r\nOn the numerical keyboard I once again see the ‚Äò#+=‚Äô button, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/cebc4b53ea.png\" width=\"682\" height=\"271\" alt=\"iPad keyboard 3\" />\r\n\r\nAnd here is my issue, since the ‚Äò+‚Äô button is nowhere to be seen on the third keyboard. What went wrong?\r\nThe answer is on the second screen, so lets get back:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/7904b61438.png\" width=\"682\" height=\"272\" alt=\"iPad keyboard 2b\" />\r\n\r\nThe problem is caused by the label of the button which brings us to the special characters keyboard. The button is labeled as ‚Äò#+=‚Äô just like the iPhone, but in this case all three characters shown on the button are already on the previous keyboard.\r\n\r\nIf Apple would simply change the characters shown on the button to characters actually on the third keyboard (I propose ‚Äò>|^‚Äô), my monkey brain would not make the mistake to press it when I'm looking for the ‚Äò+‚Äô character.\n",

This should not be the gold standard for intelligence, as it is an idiosyncratic organ that evolved for circumstances other than those we find ourselves in.\r\n<footer>Donal Clarc<cite> <a href=\"http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2020/09/lets-move-on-from-unintelligible.html\">http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2020/09/lets-move-on-from-unintelligible.html</a></cite></footer>\r\n</blockquote><script src=‚Äúhttps://micro.blog/quoteback.js‚Äù></script>\n",

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n  When we told our guide that we didn't want to go to all the tourist places he took us instead to the places where they take tourists who say that they don't want to go to tourist places. These places are, of course, full of tourists. Which is not to say that we weren't tourists every bit as much as the others, but it does highlight the irony that everything you go to see is changed by the very action of going to see it, which is the sort of problem which physicists have been wrestling with for most of this century.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ndash; Douglas Adams in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345371984/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0345371984&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=braintags-20\">Last Chance to See</a></p>\n\n<p>I am no scientific in any way, but still remember the importance of the above statement from my chemistry classes. As an example, when you want to test the pH of a liquid using a piece of litmus paper, you have to make sure that the amount of liquid is large enough to eliminate the effects of the pH change inducted by the piece of litmus paper. In other words, using litmus paper to test the pH degree of a drop of liquid has a huge error margin.</p>\n\n<p>I have this principle in mind with most things I measure. The inclusion of a piece of JavaScript on the pages of my web site in order to have Google Analytics collect data about my visitors has an effect on the user experience: the page loads a little bit slower. However, Google&rsquo;s infrastructure is fast enough so that the increase in load time is hardly noticeable.</p>\n\n<h2>URL shorteners</h2>\n\n<p>Many Twitter users also want to measure the efficiency and popularity of their tweets. The most common method of doing this is by using an intermediate server, the &lsquo;URL shortener&rsquo;, which registers each visit to the destination site.</p>\n\n<p>In the first years of Twitter, URL shorteners such as <a href=\"http://bitly.com\">bit.ly</a> were necessary to prevent long URLs from using too many of the available 140 characters in a tweet. However, in 2011Twitter implemented their <strong>own URL shortener</strong> inside their service so that each URL, including the ones passed through another shortener, only use 20 characters. Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>\n\n<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet. Once again, this was true in the past, but nowadays Twitter gives <strong>excellent statistics</strong> about the number of favourites, retweets and answers to each tweet on their <a href=\"https://analytics.twitter.com\">statistics page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest difference between Twitter&rsquo;s own shortener and external services is <strong>transparency</strong>. When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you&rsquo;re linking to if you don&rsquo;t use an external shortener &ndash; and therefore just Twitter&rsquo;s service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <strong>Single Point of Failure</strong> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>\n\n<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <em>expectation</em> was that tweets with shortened links get <strong>clicked less</strong> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>\n\n<h2>Experimenting</h2>\n\n<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code></p>\n\n<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href=\"http://bitly.com/\">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>\n\n<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <a href=\"http://tweko.com\">Tweko</a> service, which was invoked by adding the <code>#tweko</code> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>\n\n<h3>Tweet 1 -- Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\">C√≥mo ganar 2 horas productivas al d√≠a en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/2iZFFblXsn\">http://bit.ly/1c8gCuw</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/371931328067153920\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Tweet 2 -- No Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\"><p>C√≥mo ganar 2 horas productivas al d√≠a en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/ekVvviOOni\">http://canasto.es/2010/03/como-g...</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/372006931189481472\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The results</h2>\n\n<p><p>After a few weeks I decided to have a look at the statistics in Google Analytics. I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named &lsquo;TestShortener&rsquo; to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field &lsquo;ad content&rsquo; as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th>Visits</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <tfoot>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total</td>\n      <td>820</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tfoot>\n</table>\n\n<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>\n\n<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href=\"http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95\">calculate</a>:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th># successes</th>\n      <th># trials</th>\n      <th>Confidence interval</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).</p>\n\n<h2>My conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>\n",

See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.\n\nOn a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <strong>Single Point of Failure</strong> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener's service in order to get the actual address of the page you're linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.\n\nSince tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <em>expectation</em> was that tweets with shortened links get <strong>clicked less</strong> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.\n\n<h2>Experimenting</h2>\n\nFor conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code>\n\nI prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href=\"http://bitly.com/\">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.\n\nI decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <a href=\"http://tweko.com\">Tweko</a> service, which was invoked by adding the <code>#tweko</code> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.\n\nOf course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment -- the tweet with the shortened URL -- a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.\n\n<h3>Tweet 1 -- Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\">C√≥mo ganar 2 horas productivas al d√≠a en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/2iZFFblXsn\">http://bit.ly/1c8gCuw</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/371931328067153920\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Tweet 2 -- No Shortener:</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\"><p>C√≥mo ganar 2 horas productivas al d√≠a en un instante&#010;<a href=\"http://t.co/ekVvviOOni\">http://canasto.es/2010/03/como-g...</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash\">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/372006931189481472\">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The results</h2>\n\n<p>After a few weeks I decided to have a look at the statistics in Google Analytics. I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named 'TestShortener' to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field 'ad content' as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th>Visits</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <tfoot>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total</td>\n      <td>820</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tfoot>\n</table>\n\nClearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample's success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.\n\nIn order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href=\"http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95\">calculate</a>:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ad content</th>\n      <th># successes</th>\n      <th># trials</th>\n      <th>Confidence interval</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Shortener</td>\n      <td>382</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NoShortener</td>\n      <td>438</td>\n      <td>7000</td>\n      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe verdict is that the 'NoShortener' sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).\n\n<h2>My conclusion</h2>\n\nFor me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Google has released a new security measure to help you protect your ever increasing amount of data stored on their servers. This <a href=\"https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsAuthConfig\">2-step authentication</a> means that when you log in to your Google account with your username and password, you will receive a code by SMS message. Only after entering this code you will be able to get to your data.</p>\n\n<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data on Google&rsquo;s servers (I hardly ever use Gmail or Google Docs, mainly just <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/\">Google Reader</a>) I thought that it was a good idea to activate this service &ndash; better safe than sorry, right?</p>\n\n<h3>Activating 2-step verification</h3>\n\n<p>So I went ahead and activated the service. The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <em>backup verification codes</em>. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky &lsquo;finder&rsquo; the possibility to get into your Google account <strong>without</strong> needing the SMS confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>I immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that &ndash;with the current roaming rates in Europe&ndash; they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!</p>\n\n<h3>External applications</h3>\n\n<p>Satisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically.

These applications are hard-coded to ask for a username and password, and do not prompt for a verification code.

				"content_text": "Google has released a new security measure to help you protect your ever increasing amount of data stored on their servers. This <a href=\"https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsAuthConfig\">2-step authentication</a> means that when you log in to your Google account with your username and password, you will receive a code by SMS message. Only after entering this code you will be able to get to your data.\n\nEven though I don't have a lot of data on Google's servers (I hardly ever use Gmail or Google Docs, mainly just <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/\">Google Reader</a>) I thought that it was a good idea to activate this service -- better safe than sorry, right?\n\n<h3>Activating 2-step verification</h3>\n\nSo I went ahead and activated the service. The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <em>backup verification codes</em>. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky 'finder' the possibility to get into your Google account <strong>without</strong> needing the SMS confirmation.\n\nI immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that --with the current roaming rates in Europe-- they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!\n\n<h3>External applications</h3>\n\nSatisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Some mobile or desktop applications that work outside of a browser aren't yet compatible with 2-step verification.

Si su modelo de negocio se basaba en el control de las copias de las obras y en Internet no es posible sin vulnerar derechos fundamentales, deber√≠an buscar otro modelo.</li>\n    <li><strong>Consideramos que las industrias culturales necesitan para sobrevivir alternativas modernas, eficaces, cre√≠bles y asequibles</strong>¬†y que se adecuen a los nuevos usos sociales, en lugar de limitaciones tan desproporcionadas como ineficaces para el fin que dicen perseguir.</li>\n    <li><strong>Internet debe funcionar de forma libre y sin interferencias pol√≠ticas</strong>¬†auspiciadas por sectores que pretenden perpetuar obsoletos modelos de negocio e imposibilitar que el saber humano siga siendo libre.</li>\n    <li><strong>Exigimos que el Gobierno garantice por ley la neutralidad de la Red en Espa√±a</strong>, ante cualquier presi√≥n que pueda producirse, como marco para el desarrollo de una econom√≠a sostenible y realista de cara al futuro.</li>\n    <li><strong>Proponemos una verdadera reforma del derecho de propiedad intelectual</strong>¬†orientada a su fin: devolver a la sociedad el conocimiento, promover el dominio p√∫blico y limitar los abusos de las entidades gestoras.</li>\n    <li><strong>En democracia las leyes y sus modificaciones deben aprobarse tras el oportuno debate p√∫blico y habiendo consultado previamente a todas las partes implicadas</strong>. No es de recibo que se realicen cambios legislativos que afectan a derechos fundamentales en una ley no org√°nica y que versa sobre otra materia.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<em>NOTA: Este manifiesto fue redactado conjuntamente por periodistas, bloggers e internautas.

When he started talking, I remembered how Tim Ferriss also &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; e-mail in his book.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307353133\">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, Tim explains how he only reads his e-mail a few times per day while an autoresponder tells the senders to use the phone instead for more urgent messages. I have read it several times, but I still can&rsquo;t see where the productivity increase comes from. I&rsquo;d rather check my e-mail twice a day to reduce phone calls. In my opinion, phone calls are a bigger time waster that e-mail. When someone phones you, that person decides for you that the issue he is phoning about is at that moment more important than all other issues you are working on. A phone call is almost always an interruption in your workflow, while e-mail is part of the workflow. Of course, there are times when a phone call is justified, for example when a customer is having technical problems that stopped his business. The idea is to use the right tool for the job, and in the past years I have spend quite some time explaining that the phone usually is not the right tool and that e-mail or IM for more time-dependant questions are more adequate.</p>\n\n<p>Using the right tool for the job is exactly why Luis Su√°rez stopped using e-mail and changed it for instant messaging, wikis, blogs, rss, bookmark services, quickr, etc. In principle I agree with Luis that e-mail is not always the best tool to use, but at this moment there is a scattering problem when using web 2.0 tools. I already noticed this when I try to convince people to stop phoning me and use IM instead. There is a myriad of IM tools and protocols available, and to be able to communicate with all my customers I need ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Messenger, Skype and GTalk. <strong>All of them!</strong> I am a tech savvy guy, so I can handle this (all accounts are nicely accessible from one client: Digsby), but this surely is no option for many other people, who already find it very difficult to install one IM client.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine the same thing happening with all other functions of e-mail. To collaborate on a document there are dozens of services available. Of course I will choose one of them, but will me customer also use that? Of course not, they use Google Docs instead of a wiki. And as I cooperate with more people, my shared work will be shattered across the internet. I remember a customer send me a link to an interesting article, but where is it? I need to maintain a database to know that this particular customer uses Delicious to share bookmarks.</p>\n\n<p>You can say a lot about e-mail. It is not the perfect tool for collaboration or status reporting. <strong>But it is a standard</strong>. Everybody has e-mail, and everybody knows how to use it. And if you work together with many customers, using web 2.0 solutions will not be an option in the majority of cases, until there will be a common protocol or tool such as Digsby for IM that allows people using different services for a functionality to cooperate.</p>\n",

I am now finishing off the new design, after which we can finally show the world the work we have been doing. Working on a graphical design is quite an adventure for a technical person like me.

Both sites are built on eZ Publish, so I use the experiences on ons site to advance on another. I am also working to leverage some of the karma I got with blogging to new profitable projects under the Brytenet umbrella. You will read more about that when these plans have crystallized a little bit more. Anyway, currently the Brytenet site is off-line while I restructure the content, but before next week I hope to be open for business again.</p>\n\n<h2>A home project</h2>\n\n<p>There is still one room in our house where we didn&rsquo;t do anything since we moved in, the room where our visitors sleep. Those who have visited us can confirm that the beds in that room have had their time. So we are going to use our holiday in November to get rid of the current furniture and paint the room. In the mean time we are already looking for two new beds and a wardrobe to provide our guests with better rest and ourselves with more storage room.</p>\n\n<h2>Teaching sells</h2>\n\n<p>And finally I started an on-line course about making on-line courses (?) called <a href=\"http://teachingsells.com/?ref=ebdbbfb9&amp;pid=c4a0577c\">Teaching Sells</a>, which will probably help me getting all that information I have been absorbing over the past years out of my head and into my wallet.

On the NTKC terrains, people camp with tents up to 1.90 meters high and always in natural colours. When staying for a longer period, members move their tent to prevent dead grass.</p>\n<p>Most of the time there is plenty of room on the campings; in spring and autumn it might happen that you won't see anybody else from your tent!</p>\n<p>For me, being in the middle of nature is a very relaxing experience. If you live in the Netherlands and enjoy camping and nature, be sure to check out the NTKC. There are similar organisations elsewhere, such as the <a href=\"http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/\">Camping and Caravanning&nbsp; Club</a> in the U.K..</p>\n",

After removing the duplicate records, the error did not appear any more.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am able to get into my blogs, and as you see, write new items. However, as soon as I publish a new entry I get another error message: <code>Fallback Is Required At Lib/mt/util.pm Line 1331</code>.

				"content_html": "<blockquote>The <strong>Pareto principle</strong> (also known as the 80-20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity) states that for many phenomena, 80% of the consequences stem from 20% of the causes.\n<em>Source: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">Wikipedia</a></em>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Pareto principle was named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of income in Italy was received by 20% of the Italian population, but the same principle can be found in many other situations.</p>\n\n<p>In most businesses, 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales. And technical departments know that 80% of the problems are caused by only 20% of the clients. This is very interesting information for managers, who can use these numbers to steer their sales and support departments.</p>\n\n<p>But how can we correlate the Pareto numbers for these two departments? Are the 20% that purchase the most the same customers that use most of your organization&rsquo;s resources? Well, experience tells us that this is not the case: there usually are customers buying for huge amounts without ever needing the support department. The two Pareto principle are not correlated, so if we only look at the small group of customers responsible for 80% of the sales, you will find once again that 20% of that group is using 80% of the resources.</p>\n\n<p>As there is no correlation, I can easily divide my customers into four distinct groups:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>\n    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales and using 80% of the resources;</li>\n    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>\n    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales and using 80% of the resources.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I put those four groups in a specific order. The first group is worth the most, as they bring in a lot of money at low costs and the fourth group is the most difficult group.</p>\n\n<p>So should you just drop the customers in the fourth group? Of course not, as we are talking about a principle and not a fixed categorization. If you drop group four, and look again at the numbers, you will see that once again 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales and 80% of the resources are used by only 20% of the clients. Customers who were in to top 20% before, not rank lower simple because you have less customers. If I have 100 clients, there are 20 clients in the top 20%, but if I drop 50 of them, the top 20% will be formed by only 10 customers. Of course, if you have to drop customers, because you haven&rsquo;t got enough resources, make sure you drop clients from the fourth group, as the clients in the other three groups are worth more.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/5f68bb1b9d.png\" width=\"219\" height=\"281\" alt=\"Vilfredo Pareto\" /></p>\n",

I never make any <em>January 1st</em> changes to my habits, but usually do so in August or September.</p>\n\n<p>For a while I have been thinking about doing more sports, as most days my physical exercise is limited to the daily walk to the garage to pick up the car. We do occasionally walk in the mountains, but that&rsquo;s not enough. I have been thinking about it for a long time but never found the activity that suited me. My working hours make it difficult to commit to team sports and I don&rsquo;t like the gym as I prefer something in the open air.</p>\n\n<p>This summer it finally occurred me: inline skating could me my thing. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed ice skating in the Netherlands, and like the freedom of making little tours around my hometown. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea.

				"content_text": "For me the holiday period is not only a period for relaxing, but also a period of reflection. I never make any <em>January 1st</em> changes to my habits, but usually do so in August or September.\n\nFor a while I have been thinking about doing more sports, as most days my physical exercise is limited to the daily walk to the garage to pick up the car. We do occasionally walk in the mountains, but that's not enough. I have been thinking about it for a long time but never found the activity that suited me. My working hours make it difficult to commit to team sports and I don't like the gym as I prefer something in the open air.\n\nThis summer it finally occurred me: inline skating could me my thing. I've always enjoyed ice skating in the Netherlands, and like the freedom of making little tours around my hometown. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. Right after coming home I bought myself some <a href=\"http://www.rollerblade.com/\">Rollerblades</a>, the Geo II model, and downloaded some braking instructions as I knew that I'd had to learn different breaking techniques that I used on ice.\n\nThis week I went out skating two times on an empty parking lot.

				"title": "Personal finance",
				"content_html": "<blockquote><strong>Personal finance</strong> is the application of the principles of finance to the monetary decisions of an individual or family unit.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have a love/hate relationship with personal finance. Ever since I have a computer I have been trying to get a grip on finances, with changing results.</p>\n\n<h2>The excel days</h2>\n\n<p>My first attempt used the example Excel sheet created by the <abbr title=\"Nationaal Instituut voor Budgetvoorlichting\">Nibud</abbr> that came with Microsoft Excel. It was a nice and clever Excel sheet, but still living with my parents I only used part of it. After a while I stopped entering my receipts, and out went the Excel sheet.</p>\n\n<h2>Hacking in Access</h2>\n\n<p>A little bit later I started playing with Microsoft Access. Access also comes with a financial example file, and I modified and tweaked it to fit my needs. But after all the hacking, all left to be done was entering receipts and numbers, which is a boring job. I guess I still didn&rsquo;t need personal finance, as I left the database alone after some months.</p>\n\n<h2>Banking software</h2>\n\n<p>Some time later, a new phenomenon showed up: internet banking. My bank sent me some diskettes with an application that was able to import bank statements. Now that was easy! At first I tried to manage cash money with that application as well, but soon left that again. Internet banking was a success, as I have managed my bank accounts through that application until I could access my accounts through web pages. When later I started buying and selling stocks and stock options I could do that from the same application. That little application gave an overview of my bank accounts, but I still haven&rsquo;t been able to see where the money was going‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<h2>Back to basics</h2>\n\n<p>The situation complicated when I started living together. I was not dealing with my money anymore, it was <em>our</em> money. After some months the question came up: &ldquo;Where does our money go?&rdquo; We talked about it, and decided to implement a low-tech financial planning solution: pen &amp; paper. This worked great for some months, until we had more or less a picture of our expenses. Exit pen &amp; paper.</p>\n\n<h2>Excel round two</h2>\n\n<p>Last year we were planning some big expenses, and I wanted to know whether these were justified, and how much time we would need to recover the invested money. Right about that time I read about an easy budgeting template in Excel, <a href=\"http://pearbudget.com/\">Pear Budget</a>. I downloaded it, sat down half an hour to fix the categories and the budgets, and have used it ever after. It is easy and fast to maintain, gives a good overview of our spendings. However, lately I had the feeling that I wanted more.

				"content_text": "<blockquote><strong>Personal finance</strong> is the application of the principles of finance to the monetary decisions of an individual or family unit.\n\n</blockquote>\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with personal finance. Ever since I have a computer I have been trying to get a grip on finances, with changing results.\n\n<h2>The excel days</h2>\n\nMy first attempt used the example Excel sheet created by the <abbr title=\"Nationaal Instituut voor Budgetvoorlichting\">Nibud</abbr> that came with Microsoft Excel. It was a nice and clever Excel sheet, but still living with my parents I only used part of it. After a while I stopped entering my receipts, and out went the Excel sheet.\n\n<h2>Hacking in Access</h2>\n\nA little bit later I started playing with Microsoft Access. Access also comes with a financial example file, and I modified and tweaked it to fit my needs. But after all the hacking, all left to be done was entering receipts and numbers, which is a boring job. I guess I still didn't need personal finance, as I left the database alone after some months.\n\n<h2>Banking software</h2>\n\nSome time later, a new phenomenon showed up: internet banking. My bank sent me some diskettes with an application that was able to import bank statements. Now that was easy! At first I tried to manage cash money with that application as well, but soon left that again. Internet banking was a success, as I have managed my bank accounts through that application until I could access my accounts through web pages. When later I started buying and selling stocks and stock options I could do that from the same application. That little application gave an overview of my bank accounts, but I still haven't been able to see where the money was going‚Ä¶\n\n<h2>Back to basics</h2>\n\nThe situation complicated when I started living together. I was not dealing with my money anymore, it was <em>our</em> money. After some months the question came up: \"Where does our money go?\" We talked about it, and decided to implement a low-tech financial planning solution: pen & paper. This worked great for some months, until we had more or less a picture of our expenses. Exit pen & paper.\n\n<h2>Excel round two</h2>\n\nLast year we were planning some big expenses, and I wanted to know whether these were justified, and how much time we would need to recover the invested money. Right about that time I read about an easy budgeting template in Excel, <a href=\"http://pearbudget.com/\">Pear Budget</a>. I downloaded it, sat down half an hour to fix the categories and the budgets, and have used it ever after. It is easy and fast to maintain, gives a good overview of our spendings. However, lately I had the feeling that I wanted more. Pear Budget shows me where the money is coming from and where it is going, but does not show what we have, and what we are expecting to have in the future. Besides that I wanted to make some changes in the categories I had set up last year, and that would mess up all past numbers.\n\n<h2>The current solution</h2>\n\nSo I started to look around for a more complete solution, that could offer me budgeting, but also import bank statements, manage investments, work in several currencies, schedule payments, ‚Ä¶\n\nI thought a moment about searching for a Web 2.0 solution, but quickly let go that idea as I wouldn't trust such a personal information to anybody. I looked at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx\">Microsoft Money Premium</a>, but that seems a very US centred product, and is overly complex; I do not need my personal finance application to do tax statements.\n\nAfter a little but more of searching, I found <a href=\"http://www.mechcad.net/products/acemoney/\">AceMoney</a>, a cheap but very complete solution that seems to fit my current needs.

The Brytenet servers implemented PHP as a CGI process for security reasons, and there is no way to change this in an easy way.

Fortunately, coming from another EU country I have the privilege to not really need it in daily life, so there was no problem. I can use my Dutch documentation for identify myself.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can't do is to buy expensive goods as a new car or a house. I had forgotten completely about these limitations, until we started <a href=\"/2005/06/car_hunting/\">looking for a new car</a> last summer. We did buy the car on MJ's name, but I decided to go for it again and hope that they would give me a longer lasting residence card. That was in August 2005:</p>\n<p><strong>August</strong><br>\nI started by obtaining the necessary papers and filling them in. I also tried to phone to the immigration office to get an appointment for delivering these papers. After two weeks, I got my appointment, which fortunately was after the business hours of my office.</p>\n<p><strong>September 8</strong><br>\nAfter leaving the office I went to the immigration office to deliver all papers I had prepared: a special form, copies of my passport, copies of my current, expired, residence card, copies of my last salary statement, an extract from my record in the town hall‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Fortunately I had understood the cryptic instructions correctly, and all papers were in order.

Unfortunately, this can't be done with an appointment, so you simply had to queue up at the immigration office. I told my boss that I was going to arrive late, and joined the queue two hours before the office was going to open. I only had about 20 people in front of me. I already knew from last time that I would have to spend the whole morning in the queue if I would not be there before they open their doors. After spending three hours on the street, and waiting 20 minutes more inside the office, I finally got a bunch of papers back; my request had been approved. I had to go to the bank to pay the administration costs and then to the police office to get my residence card. I payed directly, and decided to visit the police the next day, since the queue was too big already.</p>\n<p><strong>November 10</strong><br>\nI told my boss that I would arrive late again, and joined the queue 90 minutes before opening time; the queue at the police station is smaller. This time I only had 12 people in from of me. After waiting two hours on the street, I was allowed to enter to show the papers I received at the immigration office and place my signature and fingerprint on a special form so they can create my residence permit. They need one full month for doing this.</p>\n<p><strong>December 30</strong><br>\nBecause of the cold and the amount of work I had in December, I didn't go to pick up my residence permit until three weeks later.

I spent about 6 hours waiting in queues on the street, 45 minutes in queues inside offices, and have been out of office during 3 hours. To me that sounds like I have wasted a lot of time for a simple administrative request. I mainly have been transporting papers from home to one office, and from one office to another; something which could easily have been done by mail. I know that I have to show up in person to get an identification document, but does this have to be for each and every step???

Fortunately, coming from another EU country I have the privilege to not really need it in daily life, so there was no problem. I can use my Dutch documentation for identify myself.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can't do is to buy expensive goods as a new car or a house. I had forgotten completely about these limitations, until we started <a href=\"/2005/06/car_hunting/\">looking for a new car</a> last summer. We did buy the car on MJ's name, but I decided to go for it again and hope that they would give me a longer lasting residence card. That was in August 2005:</p>\n<p><strong>August</strong><br>\nI started by obtaining the necessary papers and filling them in. I also tried to phone to the immigration office to get an appointment for delivering these papers.

Usually attacks take about two days before the comment spam slows down. Very few of all these comments make it through the Movable Type spam filters, and usually adding the URL to the blacklist takes care of them forever.</p>\n\n<p>Since upgrading to version 3.2 I did not receive any single comment spam.

				"content_text": "We all know that almost all comment spam is coming from virus infected PC's turned into zombies. For a while I suspected that these zombies work with a list of URIs to attack, since attacks always follow the same pattern: suddenly I receive a lot of comments from various IP addresses, but all using the same referrer and posting more or less the same message. Usually attacks take about two days before the comment spam slows down. Very few of all these comments make it through the Movable Type spam filters, and usually adding the URL to the blacklist takes care of them forever.\n\nSince upgrading to version 3.2 I did not receive any single comment spam.

With some spare time in the weekend and in the lunch breaks, which are 2¬Ω hours here, the second factor was available. I struggled a little bit more with the first factor, since I tend to jump from database design to logo design to testing out e-mail automation. But I managed to stick to my plan:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><del>Create a new domain;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Install WHM;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Move my current sites from TotalChoice Hosting to WHM;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Define my hosting packages;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Install phpCOIN;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Create a PayPal merchant account;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Install IPN module and test Paypal;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Define products and prices;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Test the order and invoice processes;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Test helpdesk e-mail processing;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Write Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy;</del></li>\n    <li><del>Tweak hundreds of parameters;</del></li>\n    <li>Design a nice logo;</li>\n    <li>Create a new stylesheet</li>\n    <li>Add some more information about the server and the hosting plans;</li>\n    <li>Add <em>hosted by</em> buttons to my current sites;</li>\n    <li>Make some publicity;</li>\n    <li>‚Ä¶profit!!!</li>\n</ul>\n\nEverything is fully operational, but it has a horrible design. I hope to fix all that this week, take my summer holidays and open the site on August 1<sup>st</sup>.\n",

				"title": "Mouse vs. Keyboard",
				"content_html": "<p>Most computers have two input devices: a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse is mainly used to navigate in the GUI, while the keyboard is used to enter data. Both input devices need some training to get used to, though I still picture my father picking up the mouse from the table and moving it through the air.</p>\n\n<p>Experienced mouse users are ably to move the pointer from one side of the screen to the other side to click on a tiny button within a fraction of a second, which is becoming increasingly difficult as the screen resolutions get bigger. Besides moving and aiming the pointer, they know how to use the three buttons and the scroll wheel at the right moment. Advanced mouse users sometimes use mouse-gesture enabled applications to perform even more functions with the mouse.</p>\n\n<p>Experienced keyboard users are able to reach high key rates using all ten fingers. Besides high speed data entry, they also use the <em>CTRL</em> and <em>ALT</em> keys to navigate through applications.</p>\n\n<p>I rarely meet persons who have reached the highest levels in using both devices. Mouse‚Äìwizards usually type with two (or three or four) fingers, while keyboard enthusiast loose time navigating. The problem is that we do not have enough hands. Efficient use of both devices requires three hands: two for the keyboard and on for the mouse. Depending on the type of work done mostly frequently, people become either mouse‚Äìaddicted or keyboard‚Äìbound.</p>\n\n<p>In my work, I receive many interrupts and rarely work more than five minutes in the same application. As a result, my primary input device is the mouse. In the past I have tried to learn to type with ten fingers on the old mechanical typewriter of my mother, but due to my mouse use I have fallen back to a two finger system.</p>\n\n<p>But things are changing.

				"content_text": "Most computers have two input devices: a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse is mainly used to navigate in the GUI, while the keyboard is used to enter data. Both input devices need some training to get used to, though I still picture my father picking up the mouse from the table and moving it through the air.\n\nExperienced mouse users are ably to move the pointer from one side of the screen to the other side to click on a tiny button within a fraction of a second, which is becoming increasingly difficult as the screen resolutions get bigger. Besides moving and aiming the pointer, they know how to use the three buttons and the scroll wheel at the right moment. Advanced mouse users sometimes use mouse-gesture enabled applications to perform even more functions with the mouse.\n\nExperienced keyboard users are able to reach high key rates using all ten fingers. Besides high speed data entry, they also use the <em>CTRL</em> and <em>ALT</em> keys to navigate through applications.\n\nI rarely meet persons who have reached the highest levels in using both devices. Mouse‚Äìwizards usually type with two (or three or four) fingers, while keyboard enthusiast loose time navigating. The problem is that we do not have enough hands. Efficient use of both devices requires three hands: two for the keyboard and on for the mouse. Depending on the type of work done mostly frequently, people become either mouse‚Äìaddicted or keyboard‚Äìbound.\n\nIn my work, I receive many interrupts and rarely work more than five minutes in the same application. As a result, my primary input device is the mouse. In the past I have tried to learn to type with ten fingers on the old mechanical typewriter of my mother, but due to my mouse use I have fallen back to a two finger system.\n\nBut things are changing. As my work slowly shifts from technical support to marketing and sales, I find myself writing more texts. And the more I write, the more I feel limited by my two‚Äìfinger technique. I write slow and make many <del>n</del>mistakes. So I decided to use the mouse less and improve my typing skills, preferably using all ten fingers.

				"content_html": "<p>Some weeks ago, we decided to change mobile provider. We have a contract with Telefonica Movistar, but most people we phone with are at Amena. We did some calculation and came to the conclusion that we could save on our bill by changing to Amena as well.</p>\n<p>This weekend we finally found the time to head to the Amena office, and we explained out plans. The nice lady in the shop asked us some questions on our phone behaviour, who, when and how much, and she explained us about all the possibilities of the different packages. We made some quick estimations and selected the ‚Äòright‚Äô package.</p>\n<p>Then the more important question came. Carriers earn so much money with all their inflated rates, that they can give away expensive toys. We could choose a new phone! MJ had prepared herself, and knew what her demands were: she wanted the cheapest phone that could flip open. Until now she always had candy-bar phones, but now she wanted clamshell. All other functions did not matter, since she only use the device for phoning and sending SMS messages. Her choice was the NEC e242.</p>\n<p>Of course, as a reader of mobile expert <a href=\"http://russellbeattie.com/notebook/\">Russell Beattie</a>, I know that there is more. Russ has the most incredible applications and uses for his mobiles, and it seems that he uses his mobile for everything I still use a PC for. But his phones are, even after the carrier discount, so incredibly expensive that it would take me years to earn that back with the cheaper rate of Amena. I guess Russ lives in another realm, but most people here choose between the five cheapest models. So I set my mind together, and thought logically. I don't phone a lot, I use SMS even less, and once in a while I use WAP to spend some dead time. Basically, any phone would be enough. But hey, I am a gadget freak, so I should have something additional to wish for, right? Maybe I need a camera on my phone, to update my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/\">photo page</a> more often. That's it! I looked around, and saw a nice and cheap Samsung phone that according to the specs had a camera. I asked if I could see it, and fell in love with the device. Cool design, very light weight (they show the phones without batteries), but‚Ä¶ without camera. I asked the friendly lady if she could show me the camera, but no, they'd made an error in the specs. So I took the cheapest camera phone they had: the NEC e242.</p>\n<p>Now we have to find a way to keep our new phones separated!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/e87aa34cbc.png\" width=\"193\" height=\"311\" alt=\"NEC e242\" /></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Some weeks ago, we decided to change mobile provider. We have a contract with Telefonica Movistar, but most people we phone with are at Amena. We did some calculation and came to the conclusion that we could save on our bill by changing to Amena as well.</p>\n<p>This weekend we finally found the time to head to the Amena office, and we explained out plans. The nice lady in the shop asked us some questions on our phone behaviour, who, when and how much, and she explained us about all the possibilities of the different packages. We made some quick estimations and selected the ‚Äòright‚Äô package.</p>\n<p>Then the more important question came. Carriers earn so much money with all their inflated rates, that they can give away expensive toys. We could choose a new phone! MJ had prepared herself, and knew what her demands were: she wanted the cheapest phone that could flip open. Until now she always had candy-bar phones, but now she wanted clamshell. All other functions did not matter, since she only use the device for phoning and sending SMS messages. Her choice was the NEC e242.</p>\n<p>Of course, as a reader of mobile expert <a href=\"http://russellbeattie.com/notebook/\">Russell Beattie</a>, I know that there is more. Russ has the most incredible applications and uses for his mobiles, and it seems that he uses his mobile for everything I still use a PC for. But his phones are, even after the carrier discount, so incredibly expensive that it would take me years to earn that back with the cheaper rate of Amena.

As the last person on the internet, I finally got to try their service out today, and just like everybody else I am very impressed.</p>\n<p>I have uploaded a bunch of photos and started playing around. thing I like most is the tagging feature, allowing me to link keywords to photos. I like Flickr so much, that I am probably going to replace my existing photo gallery which I maintain in Movable Type by Flickr.</p>\n<p>I will maintain the photos with Flickr, which will automagically create entries on my blog. The only thing I am not sure about is how to deal with comments, since both MT as Flickr allow visitors to comment on photos and I don't want my sparse comments split over two sites.</p>\n<p>For the coming period I will be uploading and tagging photos, in preparation of the new gallery.

Until yesterday; when I felt the itch of an unfinished project. In the mean time I found on the internet how to get around the rendering problem: I simply created another project that contained the problematic scene plus some footage before and after, rendered it to an AVI file, and included this file in my project. A few hours of rendering later I had my DVD!</p>\n\n<p>Happily I inserted the precious disk into our DVD player to admire the result. But‚Ä¶ all sound editing, sound levels and background music, I had done in the project had disappeared and in some scenes the sound was out of sync. Once again I was very disappointed! :-(</p>\n\n<p>I got back on the internet, and search the Pinnacle support forums. There was a huge thread about this problem, which lead me to the <a href=\"http://pinnacle.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/pinnacle.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=7871\">FAQ</a>. I have to update my software to version 9.0.8 to fix this problem. On the <a href=\"http://www.pinnaclesys.com/docsupport1.asp?division_id=1&amp;langue_id=7&amp;product_id=1501&amp;product_name=Studio%20version%209%20&amp;page_id=992\">download page</a> I found a huge patch (46 Mb) to update to version 9.1.2. What bothered me most is that this fix is from June, while I purchased the software in September.

Until yesterday; when I felt the itch of an unfinished project. In the mean time I found on the internet how to get around the rendering problem: I simply created another project that contained the problematic scene plus some footage before and after, rendered it to an AVI file, and included this file in my project. A few hours of rendering later I had my DVD!\n\nHappily I inserted the precious disk into our DVD player to admire the result. But‚Ä¶ all sound editing, sound levels and background music, I had done in the project had disappeared and in some scenes the sound was out of sync. Once again I was very disappointed! :-(\n\nI got back on the internet, and search the Pinnacle support forums. There was a huge thread about this problem, which lead me to the <a href=\"http://pinnacle.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/pinnacle.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=7871\">FAQ</a>. I have to update my software to version 9.0.8 to fix this problem. On the <a href=\"http://www.pinnaclesys.com/docsupport1.asp?division_id=1&amp;langue_id=7&amp;product_id=1501&amp;product_name=Studio%20version%209%20&amp;page_id=992\">download page</a> I found a huge patch (46 Mb) to update to version 9.1.2. What bothered me most is that this fix is from June, while I purchased the software in September. They simply sold me a defect product, while they had already solved these problems!\n\nI am downloading the patch now, and this afternoon I will buy a DVD+RW disk to try to burn my project again.\n",

It all started with the <a href=\"https://jeroensangers.com/2004/07/19/a_new_toy/\">camera</a> we received this spring. Of course we took it with us on holidays, and back home we wondered what to do with the tapes. They contained some nice material, but also a lot of &lsquo;crap&rsquo; produced when trying out the functions of the camera. I wanted to edit the video, and copy the result to a DVD for easy play back.</p>\n\n<p>So I installed the tools that came with the camera on my PC, and connected it to an USB port, only to find out that the software is useless and that USB only supports low quality video. After looking around on the internet a little bit I ordered <a href=\"http://www.pinnaclesys.com/ProductPage_n.asp?Product_ID=1502\">Pinnacle Studio DV</a>, a software suit that comes with a FireWire (IEEE-1394) PCI-card.</p>\n\n<p>After installing the card, I set to work: I copied the tapes to my hard disk, and selected the scenes to be included. I made some dark scenes a little bit lighter, and adjusted the audio levels. After adding some smooth transitions and background music my video was ready for DVD. I set my PC to render for a few hours, and the next morning I had‚Ä¶ an error message! I figured that it must be a full disk, so I cleaned up the disk and set it to render again. The next morning, I found the same error at the exactly same scene; a photo I included in the video.</p>\n\n<p>After a little bit looking around, I found a log file, giving me a more detailed error message: <code>Max Video Bitrate:8494000 for disc output</code>. Mmmm. bit rate, that must have something to do with data throughput. Since the problem appeared in a photo, I decided to increase the JPG compression of the file and give it another try. Half a day later I found the same rendering error again. I was getting frustrated, and started to search on the internet, without results. Then I looked in the configuration of Pinnacle Studio, and saw that you could configure the bit rate for DVDs. It was set at <em>automatically</em>, which gave me 60 minutes of video per DVD. Since the error message mentioned a bit rate a little bit above 8Mb, I fixed the bit rate to 8Mb, and let my PC work again&hellip; with the same result as before. Now, I lowered it to 7Mb, and pushed the Create button again. In a few hours I will know whether that has solved the problem, but I have a bad feeling about it‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p><strong>[Update 2004.10.06]</strong>: I was right, the error is still there.

This might be true for some people, but in many cases you simply need to adjust your system to fix the problem. If I have a question about GTD, I always first go to the source. The problem I described here appears on David Allen&rsquo;s site in the <a title=\"What do you do with the Actions list when it gets really long? Do you keep interacting with the whole list, or is there another alternative?\" href=\"http://davidco.com/faq.php?detail=23&amp;category=3#question23\">FAQ section</a>. David&rsquo;s answer is: <q>If it&rsquo;s &lsquo;too long&rsquo; either you need to get used to a big list of still-undone things [‚Ä¶] or you need to make fewer commitments.</q></p>\n\n<p>Of course this is very true if you implemented the system correctly. But in many cases, the problem is not the amount of commitments, but rather the way these commitments have been entered into the system. Before starting to use GTD, most people work with some kind of to-do list. New GTD users treat their N/A list in exactly the same way as their old list, only now they specify the context of the action. This is wrong, since a task is not the same as a Next Action. Anne Gennett explained it in an excellent way in <a href=\"http://davidco.com/coaches_corner/Anne_Gennett/article6.html\">The power of the real next action</a>. In her example, the client needs new glasses. So he creates a N/A &lsquo;Get new glasses&rsquo;. But getting new glasses is not an action! Getting glasses is something you can&rsquo;t do. The real N/A is to email someone for the name of an optometrist, so this is what he should have put in his list.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at a long list that contains items like &lsquo;Get new glasses&rsquo;, you get the feeling that you will never be able to finish the list. But if you put real next actions, your list contains easy to perform steps, and you will see that you can process your next actions more efficiently. <a href=\"http://davidco.com/coaches_corner/Meg_Gott/article15.html\">The next action is the very first thing you need to do to move on that item.</a></p>\n",

The first result is usually obtained within a few days: an empty inbox! Everything has been evaluated, using the well know flow chart, and stored in reference files, someday/maybe actions, next actions‚Ä¶ Small tasks (2‚Äìminute rule!) have been finished immediately, and a lot of junk has been thrown away. Great!\n\nOnce the big mess is out of the way, you only need to maintain it. Process arriving items as soon as possible, and start working your way through the Next Action list. You even do your first weekly review, to see whether there are any open loops left. You feel that you are getting grip on your workflow.\n\nBut usually after two or three weeks, the doubts come up.

And they are right in doing so; I remember that it was quite a puzzle to add the TypeKey code to my template.</p>\n<h2>So TypeKey is a failure?</h2>\n<p>After only four months, it is very early to make this kind of conclusions. Every new site that starts using MT will probably have TypeKey activated, so I expect more and more sites to use is. And when the base grows, other sites might benefit more from this service as well.</p>\n",

				"title": "Digital vs. Film cameras",
				"content_html": "<p>More and more people are buying digital cameras; I even read that the digital camera sales outnumber the traditional film cameras nowadays. I am very happy with my Canon film camera, but after I have been playing with my parents&rsquo; new Sony digital camera last week I wondered whether a digital camera would be something for me. Of course as a gadget it would most certainly be welcome, but as a replacement for my current film camera it will need to add much additional benefits. So I made a little comparison:</p>\n\n<h2>Pro digital:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Electronic format</strong>\nLogically, digital cameras store photographs in a digital format. This makes it very easy to save them on your PC.</li>\n    <li><strong>Easier handling</strong>\nRelated to the digital format, photographs taken with a digital camera are much easier to publish to the internet, to e-mail to your friends and relatives and to catalogue. Besides that you can easily retouch them using graphical editing software.</li>\n    <li><strong>No film rolls</strong>\nSince you don't need to buy film rolls, the costs per photograph will drop significantly.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cheaper workflow</strong>\nWith a digital camera you work different. You shoot your pictures, delete the ones you don't like, store them on you PC and maybe you will print your best pictures. This is a very cheap process.</li>\n    <li><strong>Quantity gives quality</strong>\nBecause the workflow is so cheap, you generally make many more images. This has two big benefits for the image quality: first you simply have a bigger chance making a photograph at the right place and the right time and secondly the more pictures you make, the more experienced you become. Professional photographers use the same tactic, but using film makes it way too expensive for amateur photographers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Pro film:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Higher resolution</strong>\nIt is difficult to compare two completely different techniques, but in general film cameras have a much higher resolution. In digital cameras the important parameter is the number of Megapixels ‚Äî even though the sensor size is more important ‚Äî so experts have been trying to calculate this number for film cameras. Results vary, but most conclude that film cameras have a resolution between 15 and 25 Megapixels.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bigger enlargements</strong>\nThe quality of enlargements is another feature in which the traditional camera beats the newcomers. A photograph made with a film camera can easily be enlarged to 40 by 50 centimetres, while a digital photograph will start losing quality at 20 by 25 cm.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cheaper cameras</strong>\nFilm cameras cost only a fraction of their digital equivalents; sometimes they are even 90% cheaper.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dynamic range</strong>\nDigital photo chips have limits in dynamic range; at a certain moment a change in subject brightness won't result in a change in image brightness anymore. Films do not have this hard limit, but rather become less and less sensitive. The dynamic range of films is larger than the dynamic range of photo chips.</li>\n    <li><strong>Proven technology</strong>\nFilm cameras on the market now do not differ much from those on the market five years ago. In general you buy a camera and use it until it stops working. A digital camera however, is new technology that is still being developed. You new 6 megapixel camera will be considered old within a year. I don't know anybody who is still using his one megapixel camera he bought two years ago, but I know several people still using a film camera they bought over a decade ago.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, digital cameras give you ease of use and electronic access to your photographs, while film cameras give you quality and are cheaper. The choice is up to you. For me it is not so important having a digital photograph ‚Äî though I would like to publish more photo&rsquo;s on this site. On a cold Sunday in winter, I like to grab a photo album and browse through the images on my sofa. I don&rsquo;t think I can have that same feeling sitting behind my computer. For the moment I still prefer film cameras to digital cameras, but maybe I might buy a very cheap digital camera for those moments I want to send a photo by e-mail or publish it on this site.</p>\n",

Here are my findings of the first days playing around.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first screen of the MT interface clearly shows a new item: the Movable Type News box. This box syndicates news from the Movable Type web site. Since I prefer to read my news in my feed reader, I immediately <a title=\"Brain Tags: Remove Movable Type News box\" href=\"/archives/2004/05/remove_movable_type_news_box/\">removed this box</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing changed in the main screen is the direct access to some weblog features. The 2.x versions had for each weblog links to create a new entry and to enter the entries list. Now you can also access the comments list, the templates list and the weblog configuration screen. The one thing I am missing here is the upload file feature, since I assume that bloggers will more often upload an image than tinker with their templates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit Entry</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also the Entry Edit screen has some ‚Äîminor‚Äî modifications. It is now possible to specify the entry date &amp; time the moment you create a new entry. In the older versions you first had to save your entry to modify the publishing time. That leaves only one feature that cannot be modified in new entries: the multiple categories.</p>\n\n<p>Another change is that the edit buttons now also work in Mozilla based browsers, but only for the entry body. If you use the extended entry field, you still have to enter the HTML code yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>\n\n<p>The comments list is new and handy feature to manage your comments. You can see the details and the status of the last comments, and open them from that screen. You can filter comments on e-mail, name and IP address, but unfortunately not on status. I don&rsquo;t receive many comments, but I assume that more popular sites would love to see only the comments that are pending for approval.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trackback</strong></p>\n\n<p>In my definition, trackbacks are nothing more than comments on my entries left on other sites. I would like to treat trackbacks in exactly the same way as comments, but unfortunately trackbacks do not have status information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plug-ins</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of the 13 plug-ins I use for this site, I removed two after upgrading.\n<a title=\"MT-Blacklist: The collective deep breath\" href=\"http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2004/05/the_collective_deep_breath\">MT-Blacklist is not compatible with MT3.0</a>, so I am removing comment spammers by hand again.</p>\n\n<p>The Optional-Redirect plug-in is not necessary anymore, since <a title=\"David Raynes: Optional-Redirect is of no use in MT 3.0\" href=\"http://www.rayners.org/2004/05/17/optionalredirect_is_of_no_use_in_mt_30.php\">the same can be achieved in MT 3.0</a> by <code>no_redirect=&ldquo;1&rdquo;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All other plug-ins work the same way as before.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Individual Archive template</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of my time went into trying to adjust the individual archive template. There have been many changes to this template to incorporate the TypeKey service, but I have not yet been able to get them to work when served as XHTML 1.1 with MIME type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. The smallest problem was to validate the template as XHTML 1.1. The new code uses some <code>name</code>s, which I changed into <code>id</code>s, and I had to edit <code>lib/MT/Template/Context.pm</code> so it won&rsquo;t use <code>valign</code> and <code>border</code> anymore &ndash; look at line 1476.</p>\n\n<p>A bigger problem is the JavaScript. Things like <code>document.comments_form.email.value</code> is easy enough changed into <code>document.getElementById(&lsquo;email&rsquo;).value</code>, but I don&rsquo;t know how to fix <code>document.write</code> so it works both on <code>text/html</code> as on <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The last problem I have with my template is that it shows the wrong comment form; the one that is normally used when TypeKey authentication is obligatory.

Besides that, I figured that the average cellphone has a maximum 5Mb of data, so it must be very cheap to set up a SyncML server. My friend Google showed me <a title=\"Mighty Phone\" href=\"http://www.mightyphone.com/\">some</a> <a title=\"Freeserve Phonesync\" href=\"http://phonesync.freeserve.com/\">companies</a> offering SyncML accounts, but they charge the same amount that I pay for hosting this whole site!!!\n\nMmm, maybe I can find some software that I can install on my own server. Once again I asked my friend Google, and he offered me two solutions: <a href=\"http://www.sync4j.org/\">Sync4j</a> is a Java based solution, which requires setting up a Java server (JBoss or Tomcat). I run Apache, and I prefer to use a solution that also uses Apache.\n\nThe <a title=\"SyncML Tools\" href=\"http://nicolas.bougues.net/syncml/\">second option</a> is a PHP solution with a mySQL back-end. That sounds a lot better! I quickly set up the database and installed the script. But my phone could not synchronize. :-( I assume that my phone uses the binary WBXML format, which is not yet supported by the script...\n\nWhat next?\n\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/eafa3524bb.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"37\" alt=\"Mobical\" /><strong>[Update 2004.05.12]</strong>: I found a free service where I can store my calendar en addresses: <a href=\"http://www.mobical.net/\">Mobical</a>. It is a pitty that they do not support notes and tasks yet, but at least I can backup my address book. Now all I have to do is find a SyncML plug-in for Palm Desktop, and I will be the happiest mobile user in the world!\n",

I assumed to see many new things, but not in the area where we have our stand.

We simply ordered a basic stand and transported all other materials ourselves. That meant that we spent two days on the <span xml:lang=\"fr\">autoroutes</span> and <span xml:lang=\"de\">autobahn</span> and one day constructing the stand. As a result, we were already tired before the show started, and looked very jealously at all consultants freshly arriving at the Microsoft stand and finding their cup of coffee already prepared.\nLike I already said, our stand was situated in a specialized POS corner, so the big public did probably not pass our stand. However, the people walking around in that particular section were exactly the people we wanted to talk to. We made many good contacts, and we have very good hopes on a good number of dealer wanting to distribute our software.\nWhat surprised us was the change in visitor types by day. On the first two days (Thursday and Friday), the audience was very international. We attended people from all over the world, but did not see many Germans. In the weekend, many students and families visited the show, which did not bring us many contacts. Monday and Tuesday suddenly the Germans and Dutch showed up, while the foreigners seemed to have gone home. On Wednesday the only visitors to the show were some teenagers begging for goodies, so it was very quiet. This made the Wednesday a perfect day to visit other exhibitors, and they also visited us.\nWhat I really missed at the CeBIT was the new technology buzz.

				"title": "MT does not Remember personal info",
				"content_html": "<p>When entering a comment in a <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/\">Movable Type</a> powered site, a radio button is available telling you that it is going to ‚ÄòRemember personal info‚Äô. However, sometimes when you come back to the same site and want to write another comment, all fields are empty. Your personal info has not been saved‚Ä¶ üôÅ</p>\n\n<p>The problem I described above appears regularly on the <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/support/\">Movable Type support forum</a>, and since the answer is always the same, I created this explanation, so I only have to point here to answer the question.</p>\n\n<p>First a small explanation on how the system is supposed to work. If you enter a comment and select the ‚ÄòRemember personal info‚Äô radio button, your name, address and URL are stored in a so-called cookie on your computer. This cookie contains the domain of the site, the directory for which the cookie is valid, an expiration date, and of course the stored value. For example, if I post a comment on an entry of this site, a cookie with the name mtcmdhome will be created with the following information:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Name: <code>mtcmdhome</code>\nContent: <code>http%3A//example.com/</code>\nDomain: <code>.jeroensangers.com</code>\nPath: <code>/</code>\nExpires: <code>28-01-2005</code>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This will make sure that the URL I entered (<code><a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://example.com/</a></code>) will be stored for one year, and can be used by any page on the <code>.jeroensangers.com</code> sites.</p>\n\n<p>MT sets this cookie using JavaScript, which you can find in the <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/default_templates.shtml#individual_entry_archive\">Individual Entry Archive</a> template. You can find this script at line 29 of the default template.</p>\n\n<p>By default, the script does not specify a path for the cookie, so that the cookie is stored using the path of the individual entry page. So the cookie of this page would only be valid for pages in <code>/2004/01/mt_does_not_remember_personal_info</code>, which is only one page. Since the cookie is not valid for my other pages, the details I filled in when commenting on this page won&rsquo;t show up in other pages. Note that the default MT installation places all archives in a single directory (e.g. <code>/archives</code>), so this problem does not appear.</p>\n\n<p>If you do place your archives into different directories, you&rsquo;ll have to need to adjust the JavaScript in the template to fit your situation. The key is that you need to specify the directory for the cookie depending on the set-up of your site. If you have your own domain like I have, you can set it to ‚Äò<code>/</code>‚Äô to be valid for the whole domain.

				"content_text": "When entering a comment in a <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/\">Movable Type</a> powered site, a radio button is available telling you that it is going to ‚ÄòRemember personal info‚Äô. However, sometimes when you come back to the same site and want to write another comment, all fields are empty. Your personal info has not been saved‚Ä¶ üôÅ\n\nThe problem I described above appears regularly on the <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/support/\">Movable Type support forum</a>, and since the answer is always the same, I created this explanation, so I only have to point here to answer the question.\n\nFirst a small explanation on how the system is supposed to work. If you enter a comment and select the ‚ÄòRemember personal info‚Äô radio button, your name, address and URL are stored in a so-called cookie on your computer. This cookie contains the domain of the site, the directory for which the cookie is valid, an expiration date, and of course the stored value. For example, if I post a comment on an entry of this site, a cookie with the name mtcmdhome will be created with the following information:\n\n<blockquote>Name: <code>mtcmdhome</code>\nContent: <code>http%3A//example.com/</code>\nDomain: <code>.jeroensangers.com</code>\nPath: <code>/</code>\nExpires: <code>28-01-2005</code>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nThis will make sure that the URL I entered (<code>http://example.com/</code>) will be stored for one year, and can be used by any page on the <code>.jeroensangers.com</code> sites.\n\nMT sets this cookie using JavaScript, which you can find in the <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/default_templates.shtml#individual_entry_archive\">Individual Entry Archive</a> template. You can find this script at line 29 of the default template.\n\nBy default, the script does not specify a path for the cookie, so that the cookie is stored using the path of the individual entry page. So the cookie of this page would only be valid for pages in <code>/2004/01/mt_does_not_remember_personal_info</code>, which is only one page. Since the cookie is not valid for my other pages, the details I filled in when commenting on this page won't show up in other pages. Note that the default MT installation places all archives in a single directory (e.g. <code>/archives</code>), so this problem does not appear.\n\nIf you do place your archives into different directories, you'll have to need to adjust the JavaScript in the template to fit your situation. The key is that you need to specify the directory for the cookie depending on the set-up of your site. If you have your own domain like I have, you can set it to ‚Äò<code>/</code>‚Äô to be valid for the whole domain. If you use a directory on the domain of your provider (e.g. <code>http://example.com/username/</code>), you can set it to ‚Äò<code>/username</code>‚Äô.\n\nTo set the directory for the cookies, edit the functions <code>rememberMe</code> and <code>forgetMe</code> in your template. The location for the path has to be inserted between the two apostrophes before <code>HOST</code>. The original code is:\n\n<blockquote>function rememberMe (f) {\nvar now = new Date();\nfixDate(now);\nnow.setTime(now.getTime() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);\nsetCookie('mtcmtauth', f.author.value, now, '', HOST, '');\nsetCookie('mtcmtmail', f.email.value, now, '', HOST, '');\nsetCookie('mtcmthome', f.url.value, now, '', HOST, '');\n}\nfunction forgetMe (f) {\ndeleteCookie('mtcmtmail', '', HOST);\ndeleteCookie('mtcmthome', '', HOST);\ndeleteCookie('mtcmtauth', '', HOST);\nf.email.value = '';\nf.author.value = '';\nf.url.value = '';\n}\n\n</blockquote>\n\nThe code for <code>http://example.com/username/</code> becomes:\n\n<blockquote>function rememberMe (f) {\nvar now = new Date();\nfixDate(now);\nnow.setTime(now.getTime() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);\nsetCookie('mtcmtauth', f.author.value, now, '/username', HOST, '');\nsetCookie('mtcmtmail', f.email.value, now, '/username', HOST, '');\nsetCookie('mtcmthome', f.url.value, now, '/username', HOST, '');\n}\nfunction forgetMe (f) {\ndeleteCookie('mtcmtmail', '/username', HOST);\ndeleteCookie('mtcmthome', '/username', HOST);\ndeleteCookie('mtcmtauth', '/username', HOST);\nf.email.value = '';\nf.author.value = '';\nf.url.value = '';\n}\n\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter making these small changes, the cookie is valid for your whole site, and the details filled in when creating a comment show up on all the pages.\n",

				"content_text": "If you are creating (X)HTML code, you always have to make sure that you use the right elements to specify the meaning of certain parts of the text. After that you can use stylesheets to determine how these parts will look. This is what they call the semantics of the text.\n\nA lot of web designers abuse tags to accomplish a certain <em>look</em>. If they want a bigger text, they use the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> element, while the text is not a header at all, if they want to indent a text, they use <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, even though they are not quoting. I won't go into detail why this is a bad thing, there are plenty of resources explaining this better than I could.\nBut a lot of designers like me who try to do it correctly still make some mistakes.

A neat list with all available plug-ins appeared.\n\nSince I didn't install my plug-ins with this tool, the plug-in manager did not know yet which plug-ins I already have installed. So I went to the Manual Registration section, where I could specify the version number and plug-in name of each file in my plugins directory.\n\nAfter entering these details I went back to my main page, and noticed an <em>update</em> button next to the IfEmpty plug-in. I was using version 1.1, while the latest version is 1.11. I clicked the button, waited some seconds and my plug-in was updated.\n\nThis is great!!! No more downloading from different sites, unzipping, FTP-ing,‚Ä¶ One click on the button does the job.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>After yesterdays post I started playing more with Movable Type.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to move some static content from my site to a separate section, as described by <a title=\"Brad Choate: Doing your whole site with MT\" href=\"http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001656.php\">Brad Choate</a>. At that moment, the only static content I had were the HTML error pages, displayed in case somebody asks a non-existing page. These pages were implemented as index templates, but with the new method I can treat them as normal texts without having to edit HTML code. I also decided to move the Stylesheet templates to the new section, since they are hardly ever updated.</p>\n\n<p>After entering the texts for the error documents, I ran into a problem. I wanted to use almost the same templates as I am using for the rest of the site, but these templates make use of template modules (text snippets), which are linked to a specific section.

				"content_text": "After yesterdays post I started playing more with Movable Type.\n\nI decided to move some static content from my site to a separate section, as described by <a title=\"Brad Choate: Doing your whole site with MT\" href=\"http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001656.php\">Brad Choate</a>. At that moment, the only static content I had were the HTML error pages, displayed in case somebody asks a non-existing page. These pages were implemented as index templates, but with the new method I can treat them as normal texts without having to edit HTML code. I also decided to move the Stylesheet templates to the new section, since they are hardly ever updated.\n\nAfter entering the texts for the error documents, I ran into a problem. I wanted to use almost the same templates as I am using for the rest of the site, but these templates make use of template modules (text snippets), which are linked to a specific section.

Therefore they try to verify that somebody is reading the mail; a verified address is worth more to the spammer.</p>\n\n<p>There are two common ways to whitelist an e-mail address. The most common is the ‚ÄòRemove me from this list‚Äô message at the bottom of much Spam.</p>\n\n<p>But instead of removing you from their Spam list, the spammer will put you on the verified addresses list, and you will surely receive more Spam. Therefore I never use these links to remove me from a Spam list.</p>\n\n<p>The second method of white listing uses images. The spammer links to an image with a code in the filename, and when you open the message this image is loaded from the spammer&rsquo;s server. After that the spammer can check the code in the image name and your e-mail address is verified!</p>\n\n<p>I usually use Mozilla mail, which let you select whether you want to view messages in HTML (including images) or as plain text. Although a lot of people send messages in HTML by default, few messages have content that NEED this, so I usually read my messages in plain text. (I also send my messages in plain text, but <a title=\"Braintags: Fancy e-mail\" href=\"/2003/06/fancy_email/\">that is a different story</a>). People using Outlook will have to disable their preview pane to prevent images from being loaded automatically.</p>\n\n<h2>I separate Spam from my normal mail</h2>\n\n<p>No matter how hard you try to prevent Spam, at a certain moment you will receive some, and it will never stop. In 99% of the cases you can easily recognise Spam from the sender and the subject, which are unknown, strange, in a foreign language and coded (texts like: jbkdk,bjhskda).</p>\n\n<p>I always make sure to directly put Spam messages in a separate folder, so I can continue reading my regular mail, and deal with the Spam later. If you don&rsquo;t receive many messages, you can do this by hand, but lazy people like me like this to be automated.</p>\n\n<p>The latest technology is based on <a title=\"A Plan for Spam\" href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html\">Bayesian Filtering</a>, and luckily Mozilla has this technique integrated.</p>\n\n<h2>I report Spam to the provider of the Spammer</h2>\n\n<p>Depending on my time (usually not a lot), I send a complaint to the provider of the Spammer. I open up my Spam folder, analyse all messages and send a message to the provider of the originating mail server and sites mentioned in the text.</p>\n\n<p>It is very difficult to find out who is the responsible, but fortunately this can be partly automated as well. I use the <a href=\"http://www.spamcop.net/\">SpamCop</a> notification service, to report Spam. SpamCop analyses the email, works out the likely true sender of the email, looks in the body to find any advertised email addresses or web sites, and then emails the administrators of all the systems involved to let them know about the problem.</p>\n\n<p>SpamCop tells me whom the notification will be sent to, so I can remove any incorrectly targeted reports from the list.</p>\n\n<h2>I don't buy</h2>\n\n<p>This last one is quite obvious, but essential. Spammers send you messages to sell something. Sending millions of e-mail is cheaper than sending leaflets by snail mail, but still costs money. If I don&rsquo;t buy anything, they will have the costs but no profit. If we all just stop buying, Spam will stop automatically!!!!</p>\n",

I need to finish the on-line edition of the Link magazine June edition. Besides that I need to activate a page I already created on which you can <a href=\"http://www.fimcap.org/en/activities/en_worldcamp_2003_news.shtml\">read live news from the World Camp</a>, a Fimcap activity for youth animators in the Philippines. During the world camp, participants will write their stories on this page. Photos will be added later by the webmasters (of which I am one), since editing pictures, uploading them and creating the right HTML code is too difficult.¬†I could have used some advanced blogging tool, but decided that for the moment NewsPro will do the job.\n\nAnd finally I have to prepare the trip. We decided to go by car to Croatia, with a stop in Milano to visit Roberto. And that is about all we decided and have prepared so far. We don't know which road to take, what we can visit and where to stay in Croatia. I hope that MJ was able to buy a copy of the <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/europe/croatia/\">Lonely Planet</a> guide, because then I will have good faith in our trip.\n\nAnyway, I am almost ready. The next two weeks it will be very quiet on this web site!\n",

I used to have some fine toys, but they have been stolen <a title=\"Braintags: Another visit\" href=\"/2003/03/another_visit/\">some months ago</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/51da26d002.png\" alt=\"Palm III\" width=\"179\" height=\"200\" />\nMy biggest proud and useful gadget was my Palm III PDA, shown above. It contained my agenda, addresses of friends, family and clients, books to read at lost moments, games and passwords (encrypted of course!). Without realising it, I used my Palm daily, and was very happy with it. But‚Ä¶ no Palm at the moment!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/35b3af6ca8.png\" alt=\"Samsung SGH-N400\" width=\"260\" height=\"210\" />\nThe other gadget I owned was a Samsung SGH-N400 cellphone. I specially liked the design of this phone (by <a href=\"http://www.pininfarina.it/\">Pininfarina</a>). But is was easy to use and had all the functions I need (vibration, WAP, small size, &hellip;). But‚Ä¶ no cellphone at the moment!</p>\n\n<p>I do have some computers, three in total. It is not the quality of them but the amount that make them geek toys. My desktop computer is the most advanced of the three, with a Cyrix P-133+ processor and 48Mb of memory. Yes, I know it is not that impressive. But after I reinstalled everything lately it runs faster that the mega computer I use at work. I did keep some room on the harddisk to install Linux to have even more pleasure. But‚Ä¶ no Linux at the moment!</p>\n\n<p>You might think that I must be a sad geek without any toys, but that is certainly not the case. I don&rsquo;t have any toys, because I am looking around to decide what toys I am going to buy. Alright, I could go into a shop and buy the latest and the greates phone, PDA and computer, but that is gonna cost me an awful lot of money.</p>\n\n<p>First of all I decided that I don&rsquo;t need a fancy cellphone. If I have time I will buy a prepaid number this weekend, and I will probably start using a second hand phone. For the moment that will be enough, since I don&rsquo;t phone a lot and neither plan to use any other functions.</p>\n\n<p>I will also keep on using my old computer. It is fast enough, and with a little bit of extra memory, a wireless connection to the ADSL router and <a title=\"Gentoo Linux\" href=\"http://www.gentoo.org/\">Linux</a> installed I sure will have lots of pleasure of it.</p>\n\n<p>That leaves me without PDA. Palm recently released a new model, the <a title=\"Palm Products - Zire 71 Handheld\" href=\"http://www.palm.com/products/handhelds/zire71/\">Zire 71</a>, which kicks ass! It has a built-in camera, so it gives me two toys for the price of one. The only problem is the price, which is around ‚Ç¨300.

I used to have some fine toys, but they have been stolen <a title=\"Braintags: Another visit\" href=\"/2003/03/another_visit/\">some months ago</a>.\n\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/51da26d002.png\" alt=\"Palm III\" width=\"179\" height=\"200\" />\nMy biggest proud and useful gadget was my Palm III PDA, shown above. It contained my agenda, addresses of friends, family and clients, books to read at lost moments, games and passwords (encrypted of course!). Without realising it, I used my Palm daily, and was very happy with it. But‚Ä¶ no Palm at the moment!\n\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/35b3af6ca8.png\" alt=\"Samsung SGH-N400\" width=\"260\" height=\"210\" />\nThe other gadget I owned was a Samsung SGH-N400 cellphone. I specially liked the design of this phone (by <a href=\"http://www.pininfarina.it/\">Pininfarina</a>). But is was easy to use and had all the functions I need (vibration, WAP, small size, ...). But‚Ä¶ no cellphone at the moment!\n\nI do have some computers, three in total. It is not the quality of them but the amount that make them geek toys. My desktop computer is the most advanced of the three, with a Cyrix P-133+ processor and 48Mb of memory. Yes, I know it is not that impressive. But after I reinstalled everything lately it runs faster that the mega computer I use at work. I did keep some room on the harddisk to install Linux to have even more pleasure. But‚Ä¶ no Linux at the moment!\n\nYou might think that I must be a sad geek without any toys, but that is certainly not the case. I don't have any toys, because I am looking around to decide what toys I am going to buy. Alright, I could go into a shop and buy the latest and the greates phone, PDA and computer, but that is gonna cost me an awful lot of money.\n\nFirst of all I decided that I don't need a fancy cellphone. If I have time I will buy a prepaid number this weekend, and I will probably start using a second hand phone. For the moment that will be enough, since I don't phone a lot and neither plan to use any other functions.\n\nI will also keep on using my old computer. It is fast enough, and with a little bit of extra memory, a wireless connection to the ADSL router and <a title=\"Gentoo Linux\" href=\"http://www.gentoo.org/\">Linux</a> installed I sure will have lots of pleasure of it.\n\nThat leaves me without PDA. Palm recently released a new model, the <a title=\"Palm Products - Zire 71 Handheld\" href=\"http://www.palm.com/products/handhelds/zire71/\">Zire 71</a>, which kicks ass! It has a built-in camera, so it gives me two toys for the price of one. The only problem is the price, which is around ‚Ç¨300. I will have to think it over a few more times, but I am afraid that I am going to buy it‚Ä¶\n\n<img src=\"https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/1558278b7b.png\" alt=\"Palm Zire 71\" width=\"161\" height=\"244\" />\n",

Besides that, we took the opportunity to rest a little bit after the last busy weeks.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, we have spent most of our time (except for Friday) on the terras in the garden of the house of my parents.</p>\n\n<p>But Friday was different, since that was the <strong>big</strong>¬†day; the day we came for.</p>\n\n<p>After getting up late, taking a North-European breakfast, and waking up under the shower we realised that most of the morning already has passed, so we started to run to get ready in time.</p>\n\n<p>Thursday we had a lot of time to wrap our presents in paper and prepare our contribution to the book with personal notes from the guests, but as usual I waited with these things until the very last moment.</p>\n\n<p>With a little bit of running we arrived exactly on time at the house of Manon&rsquo;s parents.</p>\n\n<p>Together with the family of Berry and Manon and some of their best friends we drunk a cup of coffee with some cake. We talked a little bit with Ton and Mirjam, who had brought their two children, of which I haven&rsquo;t seen the youngest (Daphne) yet. As you can imagine there were lots of things to talk about. After a while Berry and Manon arrived from their photo tour, and they looked gorgeous! Of course they were really happy to see us, and we had a small opportunity to talk a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>Because the weather was great, we were able to walk to the centre of Harmelen, were the old ‚Äòmonastery farm‚Äô (now a restaurant) provided a beautiful ambiance for the official ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>There were barely enough chairs to fit all the people present, and the ceremony was not too oficial with regular jokes about Berry&rsquo;s talent for playing darts, friends through thick and thin, and of course the hassle with the ‚Äòstoofje‚Äô under Manon&rsquo;s feet.</p>\n\n<p>Since we were in such a romantic place, Berry and Manon had chosen to use some time for some pictures together with the family, witnesses and friends in different combinations.</p>\n\n<p>After sending Loek to the supermarket to get us some water, we walked to the church.</p>\n\n<p>The mass was also really nice, although a little bit long. I participated as a witness, but was surprised to see that my role was only that: witness the rituals. I did not have to sign any document! Maybe if I would have been on the oposite site, I could have had an additional function by trying to catch Berry when he accidentally almost fell from the altar.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, after hearing them say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and seeing them exchange rings for the second time, we were absolutely sure that they were married, so it was time to party.</p>\n\n<p>Besides that we were very thirsty, and as a result we arrived first in ‚ÄòDe Putcop‚Äô, where the reception would take place. Since it was already late, we quickly sung the welcome song prepared by the family, cut the pie, congratulated the couple and sat down to (finally) have a drink.</p>\n\n<p>While we were relaxing and talking at our table, more and more people entered. Both Berry and Manon are very active Harmelen, Berry in <a title=\"The national Jong Nederland organisation\" href=\"http://www.jongnederland.nl\">Jong</a> <a title=\"Jong Nederland Harmelen\" href=\"http://jnharmelen.nl/\">Nederland</a>, <a title=\"Soccer Club Harmelen\" href=\"http://www.sch44.nl/\">SCH</a>, <a title=\"Darts club The Pirates\" href=\"http://www.vdlit.tmfweb.nl/pirates/\">the Pirates</a>, de <a title=\"Carnavals Vereniging De Kwakbollen\" href=\"http://www.kwakbollen.nl/\">Kwakbollen</a>, and Manon in EHBO.</p>\n\n<p>After filling our stomachs we were ready again for the final party, with even more people than appeared on the reception. I tried to speak at least some minutes with all my old friends, but one evening is by far too short for this. At least I (and Maria Jos√© as well) had a lot of fun.</p>\n\n<p>Sunday before leaving home again we visited Berry and Manon at home.

Besides that, we took the opportunity to rest a little bit after the last busy weeks.\n\nAs a result, we have spent most of our time (except for Friday) on the terras in the garden of the house of my parents.\n\nBut Friday was different, since that was the <strong>big</strong>¬†day; the day we came for.\n\nAfter getting up late, taking a North-European breakfast, and waking up under the shower we realised that most of the morning already has passed, so we started to run to get ready in time.\n\nThursday we had a lot of time to wrap our presents in paper and prepare our contribution to the book with personal notes from the guests, but as usual I waited with these things until the very last moment.\n\nWith a little bit of running we arrived exactly on time at the house of Manon's parents.\n\nTogether with the family of Berry and Manon and some of their best friends we drunk a cup of coffee with some cake. We talked a little bit with Ton and Mirjam, who had brought their two children, of which I haven't seen the youngest (Daphne) yet. As you can imagine there were lots of things to talk about. After a while Berry and Manon arrived from their photo tour, and they looked gorgeous! Of course they were really happy to see us, and we had a small opportunity to talk a little bit.\n\nBecause the weather was great, we were able to walk to the centre of Harmelen, were the old ‚Äòmonastery farm‚Äô (now a restaurant) provided a beautiful ambiance for the official ceremony.\n\nThere were barely enough chairs to fit all the people present, and the ceremony was not too oficial with regular jokes about Berry's talent for playing darts, friends through thick and thin, and of course the hassle with the ‚Äòstoofje‚Äô under Manon's feet.\n\nSince we were in such a romantic place, Berry and Manon had chosen to use some time for some pictures together with the family, witnesses and friends in different combinations.\n\nAfter sending Loek to the supermarket to get us some water, we walked to the church.\n\nThe mass was also really nice, although a little bit long. I participated as a witness, but was surprised to see that my role was only that: witness the rituals. I did not have to sign any document! Maybe if I would have been on the oposite site, I could have had an additional function by trying to catch Berry when he accidentally almost fell from the altar.\n\nAnyway, after hearing them say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and seeing them exchange rings for the second time, we were absolutely sure that they were married, so it was time to party.\n\nBesides that we were very thirsty, and as a result we arrived first in ‚ÄòDe Putcop‚Äô, where the reception would take place. Since it was already late, we quickly sung the welcome song prepared by the family, cut the pie, congratulated the couple and sat down to (finally) have a drink.\n\nWhile we were relaxing and talking at our table, more and more people entered. Both Berry and Manon are very active Harmelen, Berry in <a title=\"The national Jong Nederland organisation\" href=\"http://www.jongnederland.nl\">Jong</a> <a title=\"Jong Nederland Harmelen\" href=\"http://jnharmelen.nl/\">Nederland</a>, <a title=\"Soccer Club Harmelen\" href=\"http://www.sch44.nl/\">SCH</a>, <a title=\"Darts club The Pirates\" href=\"http://www.vdlit.tmfweb.nl/pirates/\">the Pirates</a>, de <a title=\"Carnavals Vereniging De Kwakbollen\" href=\"http://www.kwakbollen.nl/\">Kwakbollen</a>, and Manon in EHBO.\n\nAfter filling our stomachs we were ready again for the final party, with even more people than appeared on the reception. I tried to speak at least some minutes with all my old friends, but one evening is by far too short for this. At least I (and Maria Jos√© as well) had a lot of fun.\n\nSunday before leaving home again we visited Berry and Manon at home. We watched (parts of) the video made and talked a lot about <em>the</em> day‚Ä¶\n\nWednesday they will leave to Florida, where they will visit Disney World (they are huge fans of Disney) and have a cruise through the Caribbean.\n\nI wish them a good time, and hope to see them soon again.\n\n<strong>[Update 2004.01.21]</strong>: Changed link to JNH\n",

Just outside Lleida on the fair grounds you could eat and drink specialities from different regions of Spain. It reminded me of the typical evening at Euroforums, where each country presents their typical culinary specialities. Only here tens of thousands people were trying to get the best. We usually hang around the bar of Galicia. The difficult thing is to find your friend in this huge audience.</p>\n\n<p>Besides food and drinks there were also some concerts, of which I only remember that they were horrible.

We went shopping in town and relaxed at home. In the evening we had some friends for supper. After supper (which was around 1 o'clock) we went to the ‚Äòregional houses‚Äô. Just outside Lleida on the fair grounds you could eat and drink specialities from different regions of Spain. It reminded me of the typical evening at Euroforums, where each country presents their typical culinary specialities. Only here tens of thousands people were trying to get the best. We usually hang around the bar of Galicia. The difficult thing is to find your friend in this huge audience.\n\nBesides food and drinks there were also some concerts, of which I only remember that they were horrible. They told me that one of the artists has represented Spain on the Eurovision song contest‚Ä¶\n\nThe surprise of that evening was when I noticed someone who looked very familiar to me, only I couldn't remember why. He came to us and when he started talking I knew it.\n\nPietro had participated in a few Euroforums and is the nephew of the former Italian representative Marco. He told us that he is living in Barcelona since a few months, and he came to Lleida to party.\n\nYes, <a href=\"http://www.fimcap.org\">Fimcap</a> is like a small family‚Ä¶\n",

The typical items people buy in Andorra are gasoline (we made sure that our tank was empty when arriving‚Äîthe difference in price was ‚Ç¨0,10 per litre), sugar (we bought enough), perfumes, cigarettes (unfortunately we don't smoke), clothes (it appeared that most shops have the same owner, must be a rich guy!!!) and electronics (at the moment we don't need anything).\n\nWe took our swimming clothes with us to visit <a title=\"Caldea, Principality of Andorra, the largest health spa in Europe\" href=\"http://www.caldea.com\">Caldea</a> <a title=\"Training course Fimcap secretariat\" href=\"/2002/01/training_course_fimcap_secretariat/\">again</a>, but after a day shopping we preferred to go home instead.\n",

Within an hour I had some responses, one of them being from Michele Andreoli, the creator of muLinux (try this with Windows!). They gave me some more options to try, but the conclusion was that in creating a tiny linux distribution, Michele had to cut out PCMCIA modem support (ethernet cards are supported however). Game over‚Ä¶\n\nI do have a ‚Äònormal‚Äô serial modem which I could use to connect to the internet, but I want to use this modem as well for my desktop system. So the options are: using a serial modem or install another operating system which does support my PCMCIA modem.\n",

Mostly I use the computer for only four things: read my e-mail, read some web pages, create web pages and write documents. Over years I have tried to make my life as easy as possible, and I would like to share here with you how I am doing. Although I use both Windows (98 &amp; XP) as Linux, I will focus here on Windows.</p>\n\n<h2>Reading e-mail</h2>\n\n<p>Did you know that there are two protocols to read your e-mail? We have POP3 and IMAP.</p>\n\n<p>Most people use POP3, but IMAP is far better. Why? First of all, because IMAP leaves messages on the server, so you can see all your e-mail from any location (I know, web-based mail can also do this, but has a lot of other inconveniences).¬†You can also create folders on the server.</p>\n\n<p>At home I am still using a 28k8 modem to connect to the internet. If I want to read an important mail, but somebody has sent me a big file just before it, I&rsquo;ll have to wait for the big mail to enter first. Not with IMAP!!</p>\n\n<p>With IMAP, first the headers of the messages are downloaded, and then I can decide which message I want to download to my computer. So I can skip the big message and read the important message first.</p>\n\n<p>Like most people I am using Outlook Express for my e-mail. I know that I can install a better mail program, but why should I if OE comes preinstalled?</p>\n\n<p>There are however some things that I really don&rsquo;t like about OE, but fortunately they are easily fixed.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest problem is quoting. When replying to a message, Outlook puts the cursor and my signature above the original message. If after a while I want to read the entire thread of the message, I&rsquo;ll have to scroll down to the first message, read it, go up to the next message, read it, go up‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it would be a lot easier if everybody would write their messages <em>under</em> the original message (and trim the message!!!!). I am using a very simple program that fixes this problem automagically: <a href=\"http://flash.to/oblivion\">OE-QuoteFix</a>. By the way, when reading a threaded message, it uses colour coding to show the different replies. Really handy!!!</p>\n\n<h2>Read web pages</h2>\n\n<p>Lets continue with Internet Explorer. I use it not because it is the best, but because I can&rsquo;t deinstall it and don&rsquo;t have disk space for a better browser (<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla</a>).¬†As somebody who designs web pages I can tell you how horrible IE is‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Even though it is a bad browser, it has some features that are unknown to many people.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I really hate pop-up screens (I know, this site has them, but read on‚Ä¶). To disable them, I changed the security settings of IE so that JavaScript will be disabled (tools ‚Üí internet options ‚Üí security ‚Üí internet ‚Üí high). JavaScript is used by many web sites, but mostly for features that I am not interested in (pop-up screens, tracking of my behaviour, fancy menus, etc‚Ä¶). If I notice that a site really requires JavaScript, I simply add the site to my trusted sites. But until now that was only necessary for four sites.</p>\n\n<h2>Create web pages</h2>\n\n<p>I know that not many of you create web pages, so I&rsquo;ll keep it short.</p>\n\n<p>The greatest tool I have found is <a href=\"http://www.chami.com/html-kit/\">HTML-Kit</a>. It is free and can do a lot more than its name says (HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, XSL, JavaScript, VBScript, ASP, PHP, JSP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB, C/C++, C#, Delphi / Pascal, Lisp, SQL, and more). But if I need to quickly change something, I usually use Notepad (see below).</p>\n\n<h2>Write documents</h2>\n\n<p>One tip: You don&rsquo;t need Microsoft Word for everything!!!</p>\n\n<p>Why not? Because the application is way too big (I only use 5% of the options), because Word files are way too big (ever received a Word document under 200k?) and more important: Word documents can only be read by Microsoft Word.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if I send somebody a Word document I force him to use a really expensive text editor!!</p>\n\n<p>Most texts I simply write in <a href=\"http://www.notepad.org\">Notepad</a>, since most texts are short and don&rsquo;t need any make-up. If I want my headers to appear in another font, I&rsquo;ll switch to <a href=\"http://aroundcny.com/technofile/texts/bkwordpad97.html\">WordPad</a>. Easy enough, isn&rsquo;t it??</p>\n",

We spend the last evening of the year with our family; eating, drinking, talking, watching television‚Ä¶\n\nAt midnight I participated in a typical (hilarious) custom: eat a grape on every bang of the clock, and thus ending up with twelve grapes in your mouth!!! Maria Jos√© was not able to finish her twelve grapes, because she was rolling on the floor laughing.\n\nA little after midnight we went to visit a friend at home. She was supposed to go with us to the pub, but got ill that day (poor girl‚Ä¶). We had some more glases of cava, parked our car at home and went off to the <a href=\"http://www.pentagramasoulclub.com/\">Pentagrama</a>. I always like to go to the ‚ÄòPenta‚Äô because they play a lot of music from the eighties.\n\nThe next day we woke up incredably early, at twelve o'clock. We had a short breakfast and a quick shower and went off to the new year's lunch. In the afternoon we were painting in our house. Since we are living there we haven't worked a lot, so it still isn't finished yet. This extra free day gave us the opportunity to work a little bit.\n",

The food was great, the wine was great, the weather was great, we were on the beach, so we could take a bath after lunch and we had finally decided which furniture we want. Yes, at that moment we were very happy.\n\nOn Sunday evening my very happy moment was more simple. We were sitting on our terras drinking a beer, when I realised that I could spend hours like this.\n",
