			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/12/24/blue-light-from-screens-has.html">Blue light from screens has little effect on how quickly you fall asleep</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There has been much discussion about how blue light from screens affects our sleep, but new research shows that the impact may be smaller than we thought. Sleep experts <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087079224000376">have found</a> that blue light causes you to fall asleep on average less than three minutes later. This means that the idea that blue light significantly disrupts your sleep is largely incorrect. Although using technology just before bedtime is sometimes linked to poorer sleep, there are other factors that have more influence, such as what you watch and notifications that can wake you up.</p>
<p>People often use technology to keep themselves occupied or to feel better, which can also affect their sleep habits. It is important to know that it is not so much the blue light that affects your sleep, but more how and why you use technology. Through self-control and help from others, you can use technology wisely before bedtime so that it does not negatively affect your sleep.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/01/19/responsiveness.html">Most knowledge workers check their email within the first 30 minutes of the day</a></h1>

			 <p>Research shows that many knowledge workers check their email within half an hour of waking up. This is because email can be addictive, especially for younger people. They want to know immediately what&rsquo;s going on and feel productive when they check their email, even before their workday officially begins.</p>
<p>However, quickly checking email can also have drawbacks. It can make people feel overwhelmed by all the requests and information they see right away. This can cause stress, especially if there are urgent matters. Also, constantly switching between emails and other tasks can make people work less efficiently and find it harder to concentrate.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s tempting to check your email immediately, it might be better to do so later in the morning. This way, people can start their day with important tasks without being distracted by their inbox. By handling email more consciously, they can be more productive and start their workday calmer and more focused.</p>

			 <p>By setting aside time for tasks that are not urgent but important, you create space to think strategically and work on long-term goals. This prevents you from constantly being in a reactive mode, where you&rsquo;re only focused on putting out fires. It gives you the chance to be proactive and concentrate on what truly matters, ultimately leading to greater satisfaction and less stress.</p>
<p>Time blocking is an effective technique that can help with this. By reserving specific time blocks in your schedule for these important tasks, you protect this time from daily distractions and urgent requests that often come your way. This ensures that you consistently make progress on important projects without feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to do everything at once. Additionally, planning these blocks can help you structure your workday better and use your energy more efficiently.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2021/09/09/avoid-excessive-task.html">Avoid excessive task switching to increase efficiency</a></h1>

			 <p>When constantly switching from one task to another, so-called &lsquo;switching costs&rsquo; arise. These costs include the time and mental energy needed to reorient yourself to the new task, let go of the details of the previous task (attention residue), and fully concentrate on the new task. This process can take several minutes, which means that frequent task switching can lead to a significant decrease in productivity.</p>
<p>By handling tasks sequentially instead of in parallel, these switching costs can be minimized. Once you start a task, it is more efficient to continue it for as long as possible until it is completed. This eliminates the need to switch constantly and allows you to fully focus on the task at hand. Research has shown that subjects who repeatedly perform the same task work faster and more efficiently than when constantly switching tasks.</p>
<p>Additionally, studies have shown that employees lose a significant portion of their time by frequently switching between applications and websites. This constant switching can lead to a loss of 9% of their working time. By consciously choosing to monotask and handle tasks in a logical order, employees can increase their productivity and improve the quality of their work. It is therefore crucial to create a work environment where unnecessary interruptions are minimized and focus on one task at a time is promoted.</p>
