			 <p>What do I want <a href="https://try.tana.inc/n6sxtsf4iyxr">Tana</a> to be for me? The truth is, Tana can be anything you need it to be.</p>
<p>For me, Tana started as a simple notepad where I jotted down quick notes during my workday. Then, I began adding links and my thoughts on them, turning Tana into my personal knowledge hub. Next, I created projects and tags, and Tana became a versatile to-do list app. Now, Tana is also my research assistant, my brainstorming partner, my podcast script writer, and my contact manager.</p>
<p>Tana can be anything you want it to be. What do you want Tana to be for you?</p>

			 <p>On MacOS, you can easily hide files or folders by using the command line. This can be useful if you want to keep certain files out of sight without deleting them.</p>
<p>To do this, first open a terminal window. You can do this by pressing Command+Space, typing &ldquo;Terminal,&rdquo; and pressing Enter. In the terminal window that appears, use the <code>command chflags hidden &lt;file path&gt;</code>, replacing <code>&lt;file path&gt;</code> with the path to the file or folder you want to hide. This command marks the file or folder as hidden, making it no longer visible in Finder.</p>
<p>If you later decide that you want to make the file or folder visible again, you can use the same command with <code>nohidden</code> instead of <code>hidden</code>. This will make the file or folder visible again in Finder.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/12/24/blue-light-from-screens-has.html">Blue light from screens has little effect on how quickly you fall asleep</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/12/24/blue-light-from-screens-has.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-12-24 14:44:17 &#43;0100">Dec 24, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There has been much discussion about how blue light from screens affects our sleep, but new research shows that the impact may be smaller than we thought. Sleep experts <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087079224000376">have found</a> that blue light causes you to fall asleep on average less than three minutes later. This means that the idea that blue light significantly disrupts your sleep is largely incorrect. Although using technology just before bedtime is sometimes linked to poorer sleep, there are other factors that have more influence, such as what you watch and notifications that can wake you up.</p>
<p>People often use technology to keep themselves occupied or to feel better, which can also affect their sleep habits. It is important to know that it is not so much the blue light that affects your sleep, but more how and why you use technology. Through self-control and help from others, you can use technology wisely before bedtime so that it does not negatively affect your sleep.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/01/19/responsiveness.html">Most knowledge workers check their email within the first 30 minutes of the day</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/01/19/responsiveness.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-19 18:00:49 &#43;0100">Jan 19, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Research shows that many knowledge workers check their email within half an hour of waking up. This is because email can be addictive, especially for younger people. They want to know immediately what&rsquo;s going on and feel productive when they check their email, even before their workday officially begins.</p>
<p>However, quickly checking email can also have drawbacks. It can make people feel overwhelmed by all the requests and information they see right away. This can cause stress, especially if there are urgent matters. Also, constantly switching between emails and other tasks can make people work less efficiently and find it harder to concentrate.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s tempting to check your email immediately, it might be better to do so later in the morning. This way, people can start their day with important tasks without being distracted by their inbox. By handling email more consciously, they can be more productive and start their workday calmer and more focused.</p>

			 <p>By setting aside time for tasks that are not urgent but important, you create space to think strategically and work on long-term goals. This prevents you from constantly being in a reactive mode, where you&rsquo;re only focused on putting out fires. It gives you the chance to be proactive and concentrate on what truly matters, ultimately leading to greater satisfaction and less stress.</p>
<p>Time blocking is an effective technique that can help with this. By reserving specific time blocks in your schedule for these important tasks, you protect this time from daily distractions and urgent requests that often come your way. This ensures that you consistently make progress on important projects without feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to do everything at once. Additionally, planning these blocks can help you structure your workday better and use your energy more efficiently.</p>

			 <p>Natural light is very important for regulating our biological clock, which helps us sleep well and stay healthy. Research shows that daylight can reduce stress and improve your mood, allowing you to concentrate better and work more efficiently. Additionally, natural light can help with certain health issues, such as seasonal depression.</p>
<p>A workplace becomes more productive when there is plenty of daylight. By designing offices to allow a lot of natural light in, companies can ensure that their employees feel better and are more satisfied. This can be achieved by strategically placing windows, using glass walls, or installing systems that distribute light well. This creates a workplace that not only looks beautiful but also helps improve work performance.</p>

			 <p>Language is not just a way to communicate, but also a way to shape our thinking. For example, if you tell yourself &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat X,&rdquo; it feels like a restriction. But if you say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t eat X,&rdquo; it feels like a conscious choice. Research shows that people who say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t eatâ€¦&rdquo; are more likely to make healthy choices than those who say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat this.&rdquo; This small difference in words can greatly affect how we see ourselves and how motivated we are.</p>
<p>How we talk to ourselves is important for how we tackle problems and achieve goals. Research shows that people who ask themselves questions like &ldquo;Will I do this?&rdquo; perform better than those who say &ldquo;I will do this.&rdquo; Asking questions helps us think about what we are doing and why, and it makes us more motivated. By using questions in our self-talk, we can better handle challenges and make choices that suit us.</p>
<p>The language we use, both in our heads and with others, determines how we experience the world. By consciously choosing words that give us power and freedom of choice, we can positively influence ourselves and our behavior. It is important to pay attention to our choice of words and how we talk to ourselves, as this directly affects our well-being and how well we perform.</p>

			 <p>Research has shown that higher CO2 levels in office environments are associated with decreased performance on cognitive tests, such as the Stroop test, and an increase in reaction times for attention disorders. This suggests that a well-ventilated work environment is not only important for health, but also for maintaining mental sharpness and productivity.</p>
<p>A productive work environment requires more than just a well-designed space; air quality plays an equally important role. Poor air quality, caused by high concentrations of CO2 and particles, can lead to decreased concentration and cognitive abilities. Therefore, it is essential that workspaces are well-ventilated to keep the air clean and optimize mental performance.</p>
