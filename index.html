			 <p>As a <a href="https://kenso.es">productivity expert</a>, I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for tools that can adapt to my ever-evolving workflow. This week, I decided to experiment with <a href="https://tana.inc">Tana</a>, a system that has become my go-to for task and project management. What I love about Tana is its flexibility‚Äîit can be molded to fit any workflow, making it an indispensable tool in my productivity arsenal.</p>
<p>Until recently, I organized my tasks using a Kanban system within Tana, categorizing them into three horizons: today&rsquo;s tasks, this week&rsquo;s tasks, and future tasks. This method worked well, but as someone who constantly seeks improvement, I wanted to try something new. Enter time-blocking‚Äîa technique I had previously used with another tool, <a href="https://www.skedpal.com">SkedPal</a>. Now, with Tana&rsquo;s comprehensive capabilities, I no longer need multiple tools. Everything I need is right here.</p>
<p>The transition to time-blocking was surprisingly simple. I added a due date field to my task super tag and included a calendar in the sidebar of my daily notes page. This let me drag tasks directly into the calendar, effectively time-blocking them. I also made a few tweaks, like adding the meeting tag to the calendar to see my appointments alongside tasks. For convenience, I created command buttons to quickly schedule tasks for the day. These enhancements, while minor, showcase Tana&rsquo;s adaptability.</p>
<p>My primary goal with this experiment is to become more realistic about my commitments. I have a tendency to overcommit, and by blocking tasks on my calendar, I can better understand how long tasks take and how limited my time truly is. This awareness is crucial for prioritizing effectively and ensuring that I focus on what truly matters.</p>
<p>This week-long experiment is a testament to Tana&rsquo;s flexibility. Whether it&rsquo;s task management, knowledge management, or contact management as a CRM, Tana adapts seamlessly to any workflow. While I&rsquo;m not sure if time-blocking will become a permanent part of my routine, this trial has already highlighted the system&rsquo;s potential to enhance productivity.</p>

			 <p>In the past, work was often simple and predictable. There were fixed processes and predictable outcomes, as Armand Hatchuel describes. This made it easy to measure and manage performance. If there were problems, such as a broken machine or a sick employee, managers could quickly intervene to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>Today, work is different. Hatchuel calls this &ldquo;unconfined&rdquo; work. It involves jobs like knowledge work, care work, and creative work, where you don&rsquo;t know in advance what the outcome will be. Innovation and surprising outcomes are often the goal. This means you only know what the result is once it&rsquo;s finished. There is a lot of uncertainty about how much effort it takes to achieve these unpredictable results. For example, a home care worker doesn&rsquo;t know what they will encounter with a client, a designer doesn&rsquo;t know how a client will react to an idea, and a software developer can&rsquo;t always predict what problems will arise with the code.</p>
<p>Modern work is thus unconfined because it is not tied to fixed rules or predictable results. It requires a lot of flexibility and adaptability from workers, whether the work is physical or mental. The real challenge is dealing with the absence of boundaries and navigating the uncertainties and complexities that come with this type of work.</p>

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/09/12/discovering-the-new.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-12 17:44:08 &#43;0100">Sep 12, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been a loyal user of the Reeder app to keep up with my favorite feeds. The classic version, as it&rsquo;s now called, has been my go-to tool for organizing and reading articles. I meticulously sorted everything into folders and made it a daily ritual to check for new content, whether in the morning or sometimes even in the afternoon. It was my way of staying updated on the topics that interest me.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-paradigm-in-reeder">A new paradigm in reeder</h2>
<p>Recently, I installed the new version of <a href="https://reeder.app">Reeder</a>, and it introduced a completely different paradigm. Instead of the traditional folder system with unread counts, the new Reeder presents a more fluid experience. It&rsquo;s like a river of information flowing by, where articles and updates come and go. This new approach also allows for the integration of social media feeds, particularly from platforms like Mastodon and Micro.blog, all in one seamless stream.</p>
<h2 id="a-continuous-reading-experience">A continuous reading experience</h2>
<p>One of the features I appreciate the most is that the app remembers where I left off. When I open Reeder, it picks up right where I was, allowing me to continue reading without missing a beat. I can easily scroll through the feed, quickly skimming through articles, and only diving deeper into the ones that catch my interest. This is a significant shift from my old habit of treating my reading list like an inbox that needed to be emptied.</p>
<h2 id="embracing-the-river-of-information">Embracing the river of information</h2>
<p>This new method of handling information feels more natural to me. Instead of feeling the pressure to read every single article, I can now dip in and out of the stream of content. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I miss a post here or there. The new Reeder aligns better with how I should be consuming information‚Äîmore like a river that I occasionally wade into rather than a bucket that needs to be emptied.</p>
<h2 id="a-satisfying-investment">A satisfying investment</h2>
<p>After just half an hour of using the new Reeder, I was convinced. I decided to commit and paid for a year‚Äôs subscription, which was only 10 euros. This small investment seems like it will significantly improve my reading habits. Now, I can quickly scan through my feed, opening only the articles that truly interest me, rather than feeling obligated to read everything.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward-to-new-habits">Looking Forward to New Habits</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see how this new approach to handling information will evolve over time. The new Reeder has already made a positive impression on me, and I believe it will be a lasting change in how I consume content. If you‚Äôre looking for a more relaxed and efficient way to stay updated, I highly recommend giving the new Reeder a try. It might just transform your reading habits as it has mine.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/09/03/doing-nothing-is.html">Doing nothing is more fun than we think</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/09/03/doing-nothing-is.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-03 09:03:42 &#43;0100">Sep 3, 2024</time></a>

			 <p>Research shows that people often underestimate how much they enjoy just sitting and thinking. In a series of experiments with students, participants thought they would be bored if they had to wait in a quiet room. But in reality, they found it much more enjoyable than they expected. This shows that we often do not appreciate how important it is to take a moment to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>The idea of &ldquo;niksen,&rdquo; a Dutch word that means consciously doing nothing, fits well with these findings. Doing nothing can be seen as a way to give our minds a break, so we can relax and let our thoughts wander without distractions from the outside world. This is different from the modern habit of always being busy and seeking distractions, such as constantly checking internet news. By doing nothing, we can improve our mental health, as it gives us the opportunity to organize our thoughts and become more creative.</p>
<p>We often underestimate how valuable doing nothing can be, because we do not realize how interesting and enjoyable our own thoughts can be. People usually choose activities to keep busy, often because they are afraid of getting bored. But doing nothing can be surprisingly enriching, as shown by the positive responses of people in studies. If we learn to appreciate moments of rest more, we can learn to enjoy simply thinking and reflecting. This can ultimately contribute to a more balanced and satisfying life.</p>

			 <p>Speeding up informative videos can be an efficient strategy to save time without significant loss of understanding, as long as the speed stays within certain limits. Research shows that increasing the playback speed of videos up to 1.5x or 2x the normal speed has minimal adverse effects on both immediate and delayed (after a week) levels of understanding. This means that viewers are able to comprehend and remember the core content of the videos, even when they are played at a faster pace. However, it is important to note that performance can significantly decrease at speeds above 2x.</p>
<p>An interesting finding from the research is that repeatedly watching videos at an increased speed just before a test can improve levels of understanding compared to watching the video at normal speed only a week earlier. This suggests that the time saved by playing videos faster can be effectively used for extra study or review, which can optimize learning outcomes. However, it is crucial that this extra study time takes place shortly before the test to maximize the benefits.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve never been particularly handy around the house, and it mostly boils down to a lack of experience. Reflecting on why this is, I think there are two main reasons. First, my father was incredibly handy. He could do almost anything around the house, and he still can. Because he never really needed my help, he did everything while I watched. I never learned how to do things myself.</p>
<p>During my education, while I still lived at home, I didn‚Äôt engage in much technical work either. I spent more time on the computer and doing administrative tasks, which I‚Äôm quite good at. But when it comes to DIY projects, that‚Äôs not my forte. I saw my father do it, but since I never really helped‚Äîbeyond holding things and fetching tools‚ÄîI never learned the skills.
Now that we have our own home, there are occasional projects to tackle. However, I often run into problems because my skills and knowledge don‚Äôt match the level I want to achieve. When I want to fix or improve something, I have a vision of the outcome, but I‚Äôm not technically skilled enough to reach that outcome. It‚Äôs a matter of practice, but since our house is generally in good shape, there aren‚Äôt many opportunities to practice. This creates a vicious cycle: I don‚Äôt do many projects, so I don‚Äôt learn, and because I don‚Äôt learn, I‚Äôm hesitant to start new projects.</p>
<p>For example, when painting needs to be done, we prefer to hire someone because the result is much better than if we did it ourselves. The same goes for replacing the shower, which we had done recently. I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start, and researching it would take a lot of time. Instead, we pay someone to do it. After all, how often in your life do you replace a shower or work on plumbing? Maybe once or twice, three times at most. It‚Äôs not a good investment of my time.</p>
<p>There are, however, some things I can do. Recently, I replaced a light switch. It was a simple task, or so I thought. The new switch was a different model, so what I expected to be a straightforward job turned into a few hours of research. But in the end, it worked out perfectly. I completed a small project and felt good about it. When I can do a project and achieve the level of quality I want, I‚Äôm very satisfied.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This got me thinking about the types of projects I can do well. I‚Äôll focus on those and continue to hire professionals for the rest. It‚Äôs not worth investing time and energy into something I don‚Äôt enjoy and that frustrates me when I can‚Äôt achieve a high standard. The quality of the work matters, and if I can‚Äôt meet that standard, it‚Äôs better to let someone else handle it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while I may not be the handiest person around, I‚Äôve learned to recognize my limits and focus on what I can do well. For the rest, I‚Äôm happy to hire professionals. It‚Äôs a balance between knowing when to DIY and when to call in the experts. If you‚Äôre like me, don‚Äôt be afraid to admit your limitations and seek help when needed. It‚Äôs all about finding what works best for you and your home.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Spending at least two hours per week in nature can have significant benefits for health and well-being. A study in the United Kingdom, which surveyed nearly 20,000 participants, found that people who spent at least 120 minutes per week in nature reported better self-reported health and well-being. The likelihood of reporting good health or high well-being significantly increased with 120 minutes or more of nature contact per week. These positive associations peaked between 200 and 300 minutes per week, with no further gain from additional time in nature.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how these 120 minutes per week are achieved; both one long walk and multiple shorter visits per week can provide the same benefits. This suggests that the flexibility in planning nature visits makes it easier for people to integrate this habit into their busy lives.</p>

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/08/08/transforming-my-digital.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-08 11:12:48 &#43;0100">Aug 8, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been cultivating a <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/categories/digital-garden/">digital garden</a>‚Äîa collection of notes and thoughts that I publicly share on my website. This garden has served as a category in my archive, a place where my ideas can grow and evolve. But recently, I&rsquo;ve realized that my current method of organizing these notes isn&rsquo;t as effective as it could be. So, I&rsquo;m embarking on a journey to transform my digital garden into something more useful and meaningful.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-process-from-brain-dump-to-keyword">The old process: from brain dump to keyword</h2>
<p>My process for creating notes has always been quite organic. I use a note-taking application called <a href="https://tana.inc">Tana</a>, where I jot down ideas inspired by articles, personal thoughts, or even random musings. These notes often start as a brain dump‚Äîa collection of everything that comes to mind related to a specific theme. I then add research, citations from blog posts, podcasts, or videos that I&rsquo;ve already saved in my system.</p>
<p>Once I have all this information, I synthesize it into a statement. This statement is then summarized into a keyword, which serves as a shorthand for the note. The keyword is supposed to reflect the essence of my thoughts, including all the tangents and related topics. I then publish these notes on my website, linking them to other related notes.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-keywords">The problem with keywords</h2>
<p>Over time, I&rsquo;ve noticed that this keyword-based system has its flaws. First, the keywords are often too brief to capture the full scope of my thoughts and research. This makes it difficult for me to remember what a particular keyword was about. I might have a vague idea, but not the specific details.</p>
<p>Additionally, I often find that multiple notes could fall under the same keyword, but because I use the keyword as an identifier, this creates confusion. As a result, I&rsquo;ve stopped using keywords in my personal notes. However, my digital garden still relies on them, which has become increasingly problematic.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-approach-daily-improvements-and-detailed-explanations">A new approach: daily improvements and detailed explanations</h2>
<p>To address these issues, I&rsquo;ve implemented a new process. Every day, I review a random note from my system. I have a rule: whenever I open a note, I must improve it in some way. This rule applies to all types of notes, whether they&rsquo;re based on books, articles, meetings, or personal thoughts.</p>
<p>When I review a note, I now write a short text to accompany it. This text includes a statement that captures the core idea, followed by two or three paragraphs explaining how I arrived at that statement. I detail the background, the studies, and the other ideas that influenced my thinking. I&rsquo;ve even built an AI function to help summarize the content of my notes into these explanatory paragraphs.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-the-new-structure-in-my-digital-garden">Implementing the new structure in my digital garden</h2>
<p>This new structure‚Äîwhere the statement serves as the title and is followed by detailed explanations‚Äîhas proven to be much clearer and more useful for me. However, it doesn&rsquo;t align with the current format of my digital garden. So, starting yesterday, I&rsquo;ve begun updating my digital garden to reflect this new approach.</p>
<p>Each morning, as I review a note, I also update its corresponding entry in my digital garden. Instead of a keyword and a brief statement, the entry now features the statement as the title and the explanatory paragraphs as the content. These entries are still linked to other related notes, but I&rsquo;m being more selective about these links to ensure they add value.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-my-digital-garden">The future of my digital garden</h2>
<p>As I continue this process, you&rsquo;ll notice changes in my <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/categories/digital-garden/">digital garden</a>. The titles will become longer and more descriptive, and the content will be richer and more informative. I&rsquo;m not republishing these notes, so the original publication dates will remain the same. My hope is that this new structure will be clearer, more useful, and more engaging for those who visit my digital garden.</p>
<p>I invite you to explore this evolving space, to wander through my thoughts, and to find value in the detailed explanations that now accompany each note. This transformation is just beginning, and I believe it will make my digital garden a more meaningful and enriching place for everyone.</p>

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2024/08/07/august-productivity.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-07 09:31:30 &#43;0100">Aug 7, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Every year, I look forward to working in August. It might sound odd, but there&rsquo;s a unique charm to this month that makes it incredibly productive for me. While most people are on vacation, I find myself diving deep into my work with fewer distractions and more focus. Let me explain why August stands out as my most productive month and how I navigate its challenges.</p>
<h2 id="the-beauty-of-fewer-distractions">The Beauty of Fewer Distractions</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons I love working in August is that almost all businesses are closed for the summer holidays. This means there&rsquo;s very little input from others, allowing me to focus solely on what I believe is most important. Without the need to consider others' schedules or demands, I can prioritize my tasks and work at my own pace. This autonomy is a significant factor in why I find August so productive.</p>
<h2 id="the-downside-of-no-deadlines">The Downside of No Deadlines</h2>
<p>However, the lack of deadlines can be a double-edged sword. Without the pressure of time constraints, I sometimes fall into Parkinson&rsquo;s Law, where work expands to fill the time available. This can lead to taking more time than necessary to complete tasks, slightly diminishing productivity. It&rsquo;s a delicate balance to maintain, but being aware of this tendency helps me stay on track.</p>
<h2 id="battling-the-summer-heat">Battling the Summer Heat</h2>
<p>Another challenge of working in August is the intense summer heat. With temperatures often soaring to 40 degrees Celsius, it can be tough to stay motivated and efficient. The heat slows me down, affects my sleep, and generally makes it harder to maintain a high level of productivity. To combat this, I adjust my schedule to work during the cooler parts of the day, like early mornings, and take it easier in the afternoons when the heat is at its peak.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-right-balance">Finding the Right Balance</h2>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s all about finding the right balance. On one hand, I enjoy fewer interruptions and less pressure, which allows me to work comfortably. On the other hand, I have to contend with the slower pace brought on by the summer heat. Recognizing the different rhythms of the year is crucial. Summer might be slower, but winter tends to be more intense. Adapting to these seasonal changes and adjusting my work habits accordingly helps me optimize my productivity throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-productivity">Optimizing Productivity</h2>
<p>To make the most of August, I focus on my peak concentration times, which for me is mid-morning. I plan my most critical tasks for this period and leave less demanding activities for the afternoon when my energy levels dip. By aligning my work with my natural rhythms and the seasonal environment, I can maintain a high level of productivity even during the hottest month of the year.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Starting meetings on time significantly contributes to both the satisfaction and effectiveness of the participants. Research shows that when meetings start late, this leads to lower satisfaction with the outcomes of the meeting. Participants not only have a negative attitude towards the meeting itself, but also towards the results that come out of it. This is because a late start is often accompanied by negative socio-emotional behaviors, such as frustration and impatience, which can undermine productivity and collaboration within the group.</p>
<p>In addition, experimental studies show that starting meetings on time has a positive influence on the expected and actual effectiveness of the meeting. When meetings start on time, participants feel more respected and motivated, leading to a more constructive and efficient collaboration. Adhering to the scheduled start time can therefore be a simple but powerful way to improve the overall quality of meetings, which ultimately contributes to better decision-making and higher satisfaction among participants.</p>

			 <p>The use of SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound) is a popular way to set goals. However, there are reasons not to use this method. Firstly, the SMART principle is not based on strong scientific theories and does not align with research findings. This means that the effectiveness of SMART goals has not been well-proven by scientific research, which can lead to poorer results and confusion when using them.</p>
<p>The SMART framework does not take into account the type of goal being set and is often not applied consistently. This lack of consistency and clarity can result in goals that do not fit well with the personal needs and situations of the people trying to achieve them. Moreover, the SMART acronym does not provide enough detailed guidance, which can lead to a superficial approach to goal setting and a higher risk of negative effects, such as demotivation or stress if the goals are not met.</p>
<p>Finally, SMART goals are often not used as intended and sometimes contain redundant criteria. This can lead to inefficient and confusing objectives. Instead of sticking to a rigid and possibly flawed system, it is more useful to use more flexible and tailored methods for setting goals. These methods better fit the specific situation and needs of the people.</p>

			 <p>Various studies on sleep habits and work performance show that good sleep has a significant impact on how well people perform their jobs. A study by Rosekind et al. (2009) examined the sleep habits of more than 4,000 knowledge workers. They found that people who sleep well not only earn more but also perform much better than their colleagues who sleep poorly or too little, or suffer from insomnia. These good sleepers are better at time management, physical and mental performance, interpersonal skills, and their work output. These improvements are much more convincing than, for example, the benefits of shorter meetings.</p>
<p>Data shows that people with insomnia and insufficient sleep perform much worse at work and work less safely. They also use sleep medication more often, while others more frequently opt for non-medication treatments. Due to fatigue, employees lose an average of $1967 per year in productivity. This shows how costly sleep deprivation can be for both employees and employers.</p>
<p>The importance of good sleep cannot be emphasized enough. Sleeping in is seen as a major gain because it not only improves your performance and well-being but also has economic benefits. Employees who get enough and good sleep can do their work better and faster. This leads to higher productivity and ultimately more income.</p>

			 <p>People who sleep well are often more positive, and this is due to how sleep affects their brains. Research shows that sleep deprivation mainly affects the part of the brain that processes positive and neutral memories, the hippocampus. The part that remembers negative things, the amygdala, is less affected. As a result, people who do not get enough sleep have more difficulty retrieving positive memories, but negative memories remain well ingrained. This means that lack of sleep has a negative impact on their mood and how they see the world around them.</p>
<p>Walker conducted an experiment that clearly demonstrates this effect. In this study, sleep-deprived students had to remember a list of words. The results showed that these students could remember 81% of words with a negative meaning, such as &ldquo;cancer,&rdquo; but only 31% of words with a positive or neutral meaning, such as &ldquo;sunshine&rdquo; or &ldquo;basket.&rdquo; This difference in memory performance shows how sleep deprivation causes people to focus more on negative information, which can lead to a more pessimistic worldview and a less positive mood.</p>
<p>Many people notice that they feel happier and more positive after a good night&rsquo;s sleep. This is because enough sleep helps the brain process positive and neutral memories well. This allows you to look at the world more optimistically and balanced. In short, getting enough sleep is very important for maintaining a good mood and seeing the world in a balanced way.</p>

			 <p>When you have less energy, it can change your way of thinking and promote creativity. You are less likely to stick to usual thought patterns and more open to unexpected ideas. Research shows that people are often better at solving problems when they are less alert, such as at times of the day when they don&rsquo;t feel at their best.</p>
<p>Being creative means being able to make connections between things that seem unrelated at first glance. This is easier when you are less focused, as your mind can wander more freely and form new ideas. Sometimes it helps to let a problem rest for a while, so the solution emerges on its own. When you have less energy, you are less inclined to focus on direct, logical solutions and can instead make room for innovative ideas.</p>
<p>It may seem strange to do creative tasks when you don&rsquo;t feel energetic, but that&rsquo;s when surprising and original ideas can arise. Creativity doesn&rsquo;t always come from hard work and focus; it can flourish when you are relaxed and less alert. By consciously choosing low-energy moments for creative tasks, you can take advantage of your mind&rsquo;s natural tendency to make new and unusual connections.</p>

			 <p>Today I joined <a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=jeroen">Exist</a> to help organize and interpret my vast array of personal health data. I&rsquo;ve integrated various tools into the platform, including Apple Health, <a href="https://ouraring.com/discount/0467035ade">Oura</a>, my <a href="https://www.withings.com/es/en/scales">Withings scale</a>, and even my calendar and weather data, in order to gain a comprehensive view of my health and habits.</p>
<p>Even though the app is still in the early stages of data collection, it&rsquo;s already begun to show some interesting correlations. While some are quite predictable and not particularly useful, such as burning more energy when I exercise longer, or waking up later on weekends, others have been surprising. For instance, it appears there&rsquo;s a higher likelihood of rain in Lleida on Wednesdays - an unexpected yet intriguing find.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s truly piqued my interest, however, are the correlations related to my body metrics. I&rsquo;ve noticed that my weight tends to increase when the days are longer, a trend that seems to be quite common. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve found that my lean mass tends to be higher when I have fewer events on my calendar.</p>
<p>So far, my experience with Exist has been quite intriguing. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see the connections between various aspects of my life and health, and I&rsquo;m excited to uncover more insights as I continue to use the app.</p>

<p>After this summer‚Äôs <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/08/28/another-week-another.html">experiments with my Tevaplanter</a>, I decided this weekend whether I could grow something more permanent.</p>
<p>So I got myself a small ficus and spend half an hour removing all the soil from the roots, which was more work than  expected.</p>
<p>I am quite happy with the result.</p>
<p>The only doubt I have is where to place it. I would like to have it on my office table, but that is probably too shady, so for the moment it recovers from today‚Äôs stress in front of mef the living room window.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/10/substraction-neglect.html">Our go-to approach for problem-solving is to incorporate something new, rather than eliminate something existing</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/11/10/substraction-neglect.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-10 11:14:48 &#43;0100">Nov 10, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This phenomenon, also known as &ldquo;elimination neglect&rdquo; or &ldquo;subtraction neglect,&rdquo; is deeply rooted in our basic cognition. Research by Gabrielle S. Adams of the University of Virginia and her colleagues shows that people tend to add complexity rather than reduce it when faced with problems. This pattern has been consistently demonstrated in a series of 8 studies, where participants systematically overlooked that removing elements could be an effective solution.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;addition bias&rdquo; manifests in various contexts, such as building Lego models, planning trips, and even improving universities. People tend to add more layers of complexity, often leading to overcrowded schedules and inefficient processes. This behavior is not only limited to individual decisions but also occurs in group dynamics, such as meetings, where more and more items are added to the agenda without considering removing existing ones.</p>
<p>By becoming aware of this cognitive bias, individuals and organizations can learn to be more effective by considering what can be removed instead of added. This can result in simpler, more streamlined solutions that save both time and resources.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>While the concept of a growth mindset, as popularized by Carol Dweck, suggests that people can develop their basic abilities through dedication and hard work, a critical analysis of the literature shows that interventions designed to promote this mindset often do not lead to significant improvements in academic performance. This may be due to inadequate research, poor reporting, and bias in the studies evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of growth mindset interventions does not mean that the growth mindset itself has no value. The core ideas of the growth mindset, such as the belief that skills can be developed and that effort leads to improvement, can still be valuable for personal development and motivation. However, the specific programs and interventions designed to promote this mindset do not consistently result in improved academic performance, suggesting that there may be other factors at play that limit the effectiveness of these interventions.</p>

			 <p>This approach is related to the concept of self-efficacy, which means believing that you can perform certain tasks. If you first succeed with an easy task, you gain more confidence and prepare yourself for bigger challenges. By gradually building your skills and confidence step by step, you improve your self-confidence.</p>
<p>The idea is that each small victory contributes to your self-confidence. When you do something that is within or just outside your comfort zone, you slowly expand your comfort zone. This means you grow by challenging yourself with things that are just a bit more difficult than what you are used to. In this way, you improve your skills and self-confidence step by step. This is similar to the principle &ldquo;Fake it till you make it,&rdquo; where by practicing, you eventually become truly capable of doing something.</p>

			 <p>A 5-minute unstructured break can be sufficient to restore your concentration. Research from the University of Sydney has shown that a short interruption of just five minutes, without specific activities or structure, is enough to bring your attention back to optimal levels. This means you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to take a walk or watch a relaxing video; simply doing nothing for a short period can be effective. This finding supports the theory that a short, unstructured break is a powerful way to combat mental fatigue and increase productivity.</p>
<p>The attention restoration theory suggests that our brains need periodic rest to function optimally. Unstructured breaks, where you step away from your work without specific tasks or goals, can help restore your cognitive resources. These types of breaks offer a moment of mental rest and can therefore contribute to better focus and concentration when you return to work. It is a simple but effective strategy to improve the quality of your work without needing extensive or planned activities.</p>

			 <p>Research shows that mindfulness meditation, even in short sessions, helps you distribute your attention better. This means that your brain handles the attention needed for difficult tasks more efficiently. In a study, people who meditated briefly performed better on attention tests, such as the Flanker Task and the Attention Network Test, without their reaction time worsening. This shows that meditation helps you concentrate better, even if you don&rsquo;t have much experience with it yet. Although we don&rsquo;t know exactly how long this improved concentration lasts, the results suggest that even a short meditation can enhance your concentration ability.</p>

			 <p>Research shows that there is a correlation between income and happiness, but this relationship is complex and not straightforward. According to a study by Kahneman and Deaton (2010), happiness increases with income up to a certain point, after which the effect diminishes. This means that there is a threshold above which additional income does not significantly contribute to more happiness. On the other hand, research by Killingsworth (2021) indicates that happiness continues to increase with income, even at higher income levels. However, this effect is stronger among people who are already happier.</p>
<p>A joint reanalysis of these studies showed that the level of happiness mainly stabilizes among the least happy 20% of people. For the rest of the population, happiness continues to increase with higher income, and among the happiest people, this effect even accelerates. This means that the relationship between income and happiness is not the same for everyone and depends on how happy someone already is. The misinterpretation of earlier studies may partly be due to limitations in research methods and the way happiness was measured.</p>
<p>Money is not the only factor that contributes to happiness, but a higher income can help. It provides financial security, better healthcare, and more opportunities for relaxation and personal growth. However, the pursuit of more money can also lead to constant comparison with wealthier people, which can make you unhappy. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between financial goals and other sources of happiness, such as friendships and personal fulfillment.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://autonomy.work/portfolio/uk4dwpilotresults/">Research</a> shows that employees who work fewer hours experience less stress and are less likely to burn out. During a trial period, 39% of employees reported feeling less stressed, and 71% reported fewer burnout symptoms. Issues such as anxiety, fatigue, and sleep problems also decreased, while their mental and physical health improved. This indicates that shorter workweeks can be beneficial for employee well-being.</p>
<p>In terms of productivity, the results of shorter workweeks show that productivity does not always decline. In some cases, company revenues remained stable or even increased slightly, with an average increase of 1.4% during the trial period. Compared to previous years, companies saw an average revenue increase of 35%, indicating healthy growth despite the shorter workweek. Although employees work fewer hours in a four-day workweek, the better work-life balance and improved well-being can lead to a productivity increase of about 10%.</p>
<p>While the results are promising, there is still some criticism regarding the long-term impact on productivity. The trial periods were relatively short, and it is possible that the positive effects are partly due to work done before the trial. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that a four-day workweek could be a viable option for companies looking to improve employee well-being without significant negative impacts on productivity.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/681096">Research</a> shows that happy employees are up to 12% more productive. This is because happiness boosts your motivation and energy, allowing you to work better and faster. When you feel good, you are more likely to tackle challenges and come up with creative solutions. Therefore, it is important to make time every day for things that make you happy, whether it&rsquo;s a hobby, spending time with friends and family, or just relaxing.</p>
<p>A job that makes you happy can also improve your well-being and productivity. If your work makes you happy, you are more engaged and motivated, leading to better performance. This improved performance gives you a sense of satisfaction and happiness. This creates a positive cycle where your productivity and well-being continue to grow. Therefore, it is important not only to do things outside of work that make you happy but also to choose a career that matches your interests.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/01/10/standard-work-time.html">Working outside of standard working hours can undermine intrinsic motivation, as it prompts people to reflect on how they could have spent their day better if they had not worked</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2023/01/10/standard-work-time.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-10 15:16:49 &#43;0100">Jan 10, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This phenomenon has been studied in various studies, involving both students and full-time employees. The results showed that the awareness of working outside of standard working hours has a negative impact on intrinsic motivation. This effect occurred regardless of whether participants were explicitly reminded that they were working outside of normal working hours.</p>
<p>An important factor contributing to this undermining of intrinsic motivation is the social norm. People are social beings and tend to synchronize their schedules with those of others. When someone works outside of standard working hours, this can lead to a feeling of isolation and the idea that they are not in line with the rest of society. This can result in an increased awareness of alternative, possibly more satisfying ways to spend time, such as social activities or relaxation.</p>

			 <p>By tackling tasks immediately, you prevent them from piling up and getting in your way later. This is similar to the idea that a task is a debt you have to pay off in the future. While it can sometimes be useful to postpone things, it is usually better to handle them quickly. This keeps your task list short and allows you to make progress faster and adapt more easily to changes.</p>
<p>Working quickly and efficiently is often praised by successful people like Sam Altman and Tyler Cowen. They emphasize that acting quickly and adapting swiftly to new information is important for success. This means not only responding quickly to emails and meeting deadlines but also making decisions quickly and adjusting them if necessary. This approach ensures that you keep moving and don&rsquo;t get stuck in long decision-making processes.</p>
<p>A short task list helps you focus on what really matters and prevents you from being overwhelmed by a lot of unfinished tasks. By handling new tasks immediately, you reduce stress and make room for new challenges and opportunities. This not only increases your productivity but also your ability to remain flexible and resilient in a changing work environment.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Work about work&rdquo; refers to the activities you do to organize and coordinate your work, but that do not directly contribute to your main task. These include tasks such as communicating about work, searching for information, switching between different programs, dealing with changing priorities, and figuring out the status of ongoing projects. While these activities are necessary to move projects forward, they can be time-consuming and distract from truly productive work.</p>
<p>The concept of &ldquo;work about work&rdquo; is well-researched, including in Asana&rsquo;s Anatomy of Work Index, which surveyed over 10,000 knowledge workers worldwide. This research shows that these additional tasks take up a lot of time, leaving less time for important work that directly contributes to the organization&rsquo;s goals. This can be frustrating for employees, as they feel they cannot use their time effectively and that their productivity is hindered by these ancillary tasks.</p>
<p>To reduce the impact of &ldquo;work about work,&rdquo; organizations can simplify their workflows and use technologies that require less communication and information searching. Spending less time on &ldquo;work about work&rdquo; can not only increase productivity but also enhance job satisfaction and employee well-being.</p>

			 <p>Professionals lose an average of three hours per week on unnecessary meetings, which has a significant impact on their productivity and job satisfaction. This waste of time can often be attributed to poorly organized meetings with no clear agenda or where the topics discussed are not relevant to all attendees. The feeling that &ldquo;this meeting could have been an email&rdquo; is a common complaint among employees, indicating that many meetings are not effectively utilized.</p>
<p>The costs of these unnecessary meetings are not only time-bound, but also have financial implications for organizations. By using tools such as the Meeting Cost Calculator, companies can gain insight into the actual costs of meetings and make better decisions about whether a meeting is necessary. Reducing unnecessary meetings can lead to a more efficient use of time and resources, and can contribute to higher satisfaction and effectiveness among employees.</p>

			 <p>If employees always feel that they need to be available, even outside of work hours, it can cause a lot of stress. This constant stress can lead to health problems such as high blood pressure, sleep issues, and a weakened immune system. The feeling that you always have to be &ldquo;on,&rdquo; without a clear separation between work and personal life, can also harm your mental health and cause anxiety and fatigue.</p>
<p>Additionally, checking emails outside of work hours can also cause problems in relationships. The constant distraction and the need to handle work matters can reduce the quality of personal relationships. Partners and family members may feel neglected or frustrated by the continuous interruptions, which can lead to conflicts and a poorer relationship. It is important to set clear boundaries and discuss expectations to maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>
<p>Finally, the pressure to check emails outside of work hours can contribute to feelings of anxiety. Employees may feel overwhelmed by the constant stream of work messages and the expectation to respond quickly. This can make them always alert and unable to relax properly, even in their free time. It is important for employers to have realistic expectations and encourage employees to set clear boundaries. This way, they have enough time to recover and ensure their well-being.</p>

			 <p>Why am I still using 1Password? A few days ago I asked myself this question, and the only answer I could come up with was ‚ÄúBecause that&rsquo;s what I have been doing for years‚Äù.</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like 1Password and in the past it was vastly superior to any alternative. I loved that it could handle two-factor authentication without needing an additional app, and I liked their password suggestions.</p>
<p>But most features are now also available in the iCloud Keychain.</p>
<p>So today I migrated.</p>
<p>For a moment I thought that this would be the perfect occasion to clean up my list of passwords and delete services that don&rsquo;t exist anymore, update easy to guess passwords. But that would change a 30-minute project into a 30-day project.</p>
<p>The migration itself was fairly simple. I followed <a href="https://simonbs.dev/posts/moving-from-1password-to-icloud-keychain/">the procedure from Simon B. St√∏vring</a>: simply exporting all items from 1Password and importing them into the iCloud Keychain. Then I did an advanced search in 1Password for all items with two-factor authentication and created a locked note in Notes to store the backup codes.</p>

			 <p>Not so much for focusing, but simply because it solves a practical problem for me.</p>
<p>You see, just like many people of my age I need reading glasses. Now, when I am working at my desk, I usually have a pair handy, but when I am out and about I usually leave them at home.</p>
<p>My solution in those cases is incrementing the text size in iOS to Extra Extra Extra Large, so I can read everything without glasses. The issue is that when I get home and use my phone with my glasses in the text is way to big and I have to set the text size back.</p>
<p>Now to make these text size changes easier, I took a two-step approach.</p>
<p>First, instead of changing the size in the phone‚Äôs settings, I used Shortcuts to create a very simple one-step automation:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And in iOS 16, I can use focus modes to automatically trigger these shortcuts by creating automations in the Shotcuts app:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now all I have to do is switch my phone from one focus mode to another, and since I have smart activation configured, my phone quickly learned when to activate each mode, so usually I have the correct text size.</p>

			 <p>Editing and combining recordings of instruments and vocals is an important part of music production. This ensures that a song sounds clear and coherent. This process is called audio mixing and involves adjusting the volume, creating space and depth, and finding the balance between different sounds. The goal is to create a clear-sounding piece of music where each part is well-heard and works beautifully with the rest.</p>
<p>During mixing, you use various techniques to control the dynamics of the music. This may mean using compression to manage the volume of certain parts, or equalizers to enhance or reduce certain tones. It is also important to apply effects like reverb and echo wisely to create a sense of space and atmosphere, making the mix more lively and immersive.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of audio mixing is to create a smooth and balanced mix where instruments and vocals come together beautifully. This requires a good ear for detail and an artistic sense of how different sounds complement each other. By listening carefully and making adjustments, the mixer can ensure that the final result is not only technically sound but also emotionally engaging for the listener.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Three weeks ago I decided to <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2022/08/03/im-picking-up.html">get into music mixing</a> and today I ‚Äòfinished‚Äô my first mix. I put the word ‚Äòfinished‚Äô in quotes, since any creative project is never truly finished. There is always more to tweak and polish.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now I am quite happy with the result of this first project, though it is nowhere near a professional level, as you will hear.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-the-song">Selecting the song</h2>
<p>Since I am no musician, I first had to find the music tracks to mix. After looking around a little bit I the perfect multitrack (as a collection of the individual tracks of a song is called) on YouTube.</p>
<p>The Produce like a pro published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOqpPFqq72k">review of the Audient iD14 MKII audio interface</a>, which happens to be the audio interface we use for <a href="https://audient.com/2022/01/31/kenso-podcast-id14/">recording the KENSO podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, they used the interface to record the song <a href="https://song.link/jzmnqmsqxgqfz">Hold On To Me At The End Of The Night</a> by Steve Maggiora and offer the multitrack to their subscribers.</p>
<h2 id="the-editing-process">The editing process</h2>
<p>Before starting this edit, I had already read and watched quite some material about music editing, so I had a rough idea on the steps involved in this process. I learned about gain staging, drum EQ and compression, how to solve ‚Äòmuddy‚Äô mixes and the use of sidechain compression.</p>
<p>Of course, this was all theoretical knowledge, which I had never applied in a real project. And that turned out to be a lot harder than I thought.</p>
<p>My main problem was that my ears are simply not trained to hear the subtle differences in the music. That obliged my to do a lot of work in soloed out tracks, something most expert recommend not doing because it&rsquo;s better to work on the complete mix.</p>
<p>Anyway, the mix is now at a point where I think it is quite good and, as promised, I will share the results here.</p>
<h2 id="the-song">The song</h2>
<p>OK, here we go. I could not find any copyright notice in the downloaded files, but the song is available on all platforms, si I assume I am not allowed to publish the final mix here. However, I hope it is fine if I share just a fragment of the song.</p>
<p>This is what the original tracks sound like. I simple added them all together and did not any processing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is my mix:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally, this is the same fragment from the final, professionally mixed, release:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you can notice, I have been able to improve the unprocessed files significantly, but my mix is still less clear and more muddy than the professional mix.</p>
<p>And that is alright, since my goal is to learn and improve over time.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s find the next song to edit.</p>

			 <p>For the past four years I have edited a <a href="https://kenso.es/podcast">weekly podcast</a>. At first using free online tools, the  in GarageBand and lately using Logic Pro.</p>
<p>And the more I edit, the more I like it. At the same time I also realize that I still have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>So I took some courses about voice-over editing, EQ, compressors, limiters. I read quite some manuals and watched many hours of videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>I am now on a point where, if I really want to improve my podcast editing skills, I should start working on other podcasts to oblige myself to get out of my routines and templates.</p>
<p>But that would make podcast editing my main job.</p>
<p>Instead, of that, I decided to start mixing and editing music in my spare time.</p>
<p>Music is fun and cannot be confused with work. And to properly mix music, I will have to learn several new skills (I don‚Äôt play any instrument myself and can‚Äôt sing), most of which will probably be useless for podcast editing.</p>
<p>But I feel that I will also find things that could improve my podcast editing.</p>
<p>Si this is the plan: once a month I will mix a song and post the before and after tracks here on my site.</p>
<p>Next step: find an interesting song in multitrack format to download.</p>

			 <p>This process ensures that each individual has the chance to formulate their thoughts without influence from others. It prevents dominant group members from dominating the discussion and allows for a wide range of ideas. By first thinking individually, participants can let their creativity flow without worrying about direct criticism or judgment from others. This often leads to a greater variety and originality in the generated ideas.</p>
<p>After writing down their own ideas, group members come together to discuss and further develop these ideas. This joint session provides the opportunity to evaluate, combine, and refine individual ideas. The group conversation can offer new perspectives and insights that individuals may have overlooked. Additionally, the interaction between group members can lead to synergy, where collaboration results in ideas that are better than the sum of individual contributions. By following this approach, the effectiveness of idea exchange is maximized and a productive and creative group dynamic is fostered.</p>

<p>I have always thought that not having to waste precious time on a commute was one of the perks of working from home.</p>
<p>But lately I found that there are some benefits that I am missing out on.</p>
<p>Last autumn I experimented with what I call an ‚Äòextended commute‚Äô and really liked it, but I did not make it into a habit. And today I decided that I wanted to try it again.</p>
<p>So what exactly is an ‚Äò<em>extended morning commute</em>‚Äô?</p>
<p>Very simple: my extended commute means that I take a detour and instead of walking the shortest route from the dining room to the office I pass through some outside space.</p>
<p>My aim is to walk about 2 kilometres on my detour, but I will allow myself a shorter commute to our patio or balcony in case of rain or lack of time. Of course, I am may also decide to extend my commute even more if I feel like. After all, I am my own boss.</p>
<p>I try to accomplish several things by extending my morning commute. The main benefit is an increase in energy during the morning because I activated my body. Then there are the <a href="https://hubermanlab.libsyn.com/website/optimize-your-brain-with-science-based-tools-huberman-lab-podcast-8">positive effects of light exposure early in the morning</a> and the clear transition ritual telling my brain exactly when it is time to switch to ‚Äòwork mode‚Äô.</p>
<p>A final benefit is the opportunity to explore my neighbourhood. I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/es/app/eroutes-walk-run-cycle/id1360999230?l=en&amp;at=11lJXb">eRoutes</a> app to generate three random walking routes with the length I specify and today it already surprised me by passing through a street I haven&rsquo;t traversed for many years.</p>

			 <p>On one hand, some studies suggest that messy spaces can stimulate creativity. A 2013 study from the University of Minnesota showed that people working in messy rooms were more likely to come up with creative ideas than those in tidy offices. This may mean that a chaotic environment helps to think differently and come up with new ideas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are also studies that say messy places do not affect how well you can think. Research shows that the amount of clutter in a workspace has no effect on things like planning, attention, and problem-solving. This means that, although a messy environment may promote creativity, it does not directly impact how well you think.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems that the effect of a messy workplace depends on personal preference. Some people are inspired by clutter, while others work better in a tidy space. It is important to discover which environment suits you best, as there is no clear answer to whether clutter affects creativity or cognitive ability.</p>

			 <p>This is because environmental noise has a significant and negative impact on cognitive tasks that require concentration. Noise pollution leads to increased mental load, making it more difficult for employees to concentrate and causing errors to occur more quickly. This effect is particularly noticeable in tasks that require a longer duration and a high level of accuracy, such as problem solving or complex calculations.</p>
<p>Additionally, research shows that noise pollution does not directly affect the effort of employees, but it does affect their ability to think clearly. This means that employees may not be aware of the negative impact of noise on their performance, as they are still putting in the same amount of effort. However, the quality of their work suffers, resulting in lower productivity.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/665048">Research shows</a> that a little background noise can help you think more creatively. This is because a moderate noise level, such as 70 decibels, stimulates your brain to think in a different way. This allows you to be more creative, as you look beyond the obvious solutions and discover new ideas. It&rsquo;s similar to the effect of a caf√© or a busy street, where the constant noise distracts your thoughts just enough to flow freely without becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>On the other hand, too much noise, such as 85 decibels or more, can actually be detrimental to your creativity. At this high noise level, it becomes harder to think clearly, which can reduce your creativity. It&rsquo;s like trying to solve a difficult problem in a concert hall; the loud noise makes it difficult to concentrate and think clearly. Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to find a balance in the noise level of your environment if you want to be creative. A little background noise can be helpful, but too much can be counterproductive.</p>

			 <p>By setting aside time for tasks that are not urgent but important, you create space to think strategically and work on long-term goals. This prevents you from constantly being in a reactive mode, where you&rsquo;re only focused on putting out fires. It gives you the chance to be proactive and concentrate on what truly matters, ultimately leading to greater satisfaction and less stress.</p>
<p>Time blocking is an effective technique that can help with this. By reserving specific time blocks in your schedule for these important tasks, you protect this time from daily distractions and urgent requests that often come your way. This ensures that you consistently make progress on important projects without feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to do everything at once. Additionally, planning these blocks can help you structure your workday better and use your energy more efficiently.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I show the new iPhone 13 Mini I bought a few weeks ago to friends or family, often I get the same reaction: ‚ÄúNice! But it&rsquo;s really small‚Ä¶‚Äù.</p>
<p>Yes, it is small, but that is exactly what I want from my mobile phone.</p>
<p>I know that the general consensus about phone sizes is to get the biggest screen possible in the smallest device possible, but my phone use is atypical.</p>
<p>For many people, and especially the younger generations, the phone is their main communication device. It is their most used ‚Äò<em>screen</em>‚Äô, on which they communicate with friends, watch videos, write their notes, read information and many things more.</p>
<p>If I look at the ‚Äòscreens‚Äô in my life, my phone comes at the fourth place.</p>
<p>My main ‚Äòscreen‚Äô is my computer. I not only use it for my work, but also for watching videos, playing games, writing, messaging and reading in my free time.</p>
<p>My second most used ‚Äòscreen‚Äô is my iPad, which I use mainly in our living room and at the patio. This device is mainly for information consumption: books, feeds, saved articles, videos, messaging and social networks. I also use it a lot for looking up information.</p>
<p>At the third position, we have our television. I don&rsquo;t watch a lot of TV, but still use it more than my phone.</p>
<p>That leaves my phone on the fourth position. I hardly ever use it when I am at home, as I usually have a way bigger screen available. For me, the most important function is to be mobile and easy to carry with me. That is why I chose the smallest possible device.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The statement &ldquo;Whether you think you can or think you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re right&rdquo; highlights the importance of your beliefs in what you can achieve. This phrase, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/03/you-can/">often attributed to Henry Ford</a>, suggests that your mindset greatly influences your success. If you believe you can do something, you are more likely to work hard and overcome challenges. This idea is similar to a growth mindset, where you believe that your abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and hard work.</p>
<p>If you think you can&rsquo;t do something, it can lead to actual failure. This negative way of thinking can cause you to put in less effort, give up more easily when faced with difficulties, and be less creative in finding solutions. Research shows that how we think about things, like stress, can sometimes have more impact on our health than the stress itself.</p>
<p>In short, the statement emphasizes the importance of having a positive and flexible attitude. Talent and intelligence are important, but often it is our beliefs and the willingness to learn and grow that truly make the difference. By believing in ourselves, we increase the chances of success and personal growth.</p>

			 <p>Natural light is very important for regulating our biological clock, which helps us sleep well and stay healthy. Research shows that daylight can reduce stress and improve your mood, allowing you to concentrate better and work more efficiently. Additionally, natural light can help with certain health issues, such as seasonal depression.</p>
<p>A workplace becomes more productive when there is plenty of daylight. By designing offices to allow a lot of natural light in, companies can ensure that their employees feel better and are more satisfied. This can be achieved by strategically placing windows, using glass walls, or installing systems that distribute light well. This creates a workplace that not only looks beautiful but also helps improve work performance.</p>

			 <p>Artworks can create a calming and inspiring environment, which helps improve the overall work experience. This is because visual stimulation through art can contribute to a positive mood, which in turn reduces stress and promotes a sense of well-being.</p>
<p>Additionally, art in the workplace can stimulate creativity. Artworks can serve as a source of inspiration and new ideas, which is especially useful in creative professions or during brainstorming sessions. By being regularly exposed to art, employees can improve their imagination and problem-solving skills, leading to innovative solutions and a dynamic work environment.</p>
<p>Lastly, art contributes to increased productivity. A pleasant and aesthetically appealing workspace can increase motivation and engagement of employees. When people feel comfortable in their work environment, they are more likely to work efficiently and with more dedication. Moreover, art can serve as a social signal that a company values culture and creativity, which can contribute to a positive company culture and attract talent.</p>

			 <p>Videoconferences require participants to focus their attention on a small part of the screen. This limits their thinking processes, which can lead to less creativity and fewer new ideas. Research shows that videoconferences make it harder to come up with new ideas because people have to concentrate on the screen, which narrows their thinking ability.</p>
<p>The body&rsquo;s response to the visual field plays a role in this. When people are relaxed, their pupils become smaller so they can see everything around them. But in stressful or exciting situations, the pupils become larger and they see less of their surroundings. This works both ways: when you are relaxed, your attention broadens, and with a wide attention, you become more relaxed.</p>
<p>The increased cognitive load during videoconferences, as shown by the increase in pupil size, makes it harder to think outside the box. The need to constantly stay focused on the screen and its interactions means that the brain has less room to wander and make new, creative connections. All of this leads to a reduction in divergent thinking, which is essential for innovation and problem-solving.</p>

			 <p>üì∏ Day 2: <strong>Photo</strong></p>
<p>Last year I used my fancy pants camera to participate in the Micro.blog Photoblogging Challenge, but since I got a new phone last week I decided that this would be the perfect occasion for trying out mobile photography in different situations.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/02/sorting-emails-into.html">Sorting emails into folders wastes a lot of time; use one archive folder and search for emails when you need them instead</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2022/05/02/sorting-emails-into.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-05-02 08:08:00 &#43;0100">May 2, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Sorting emails into different folders may seem like an efficient way to keep your inbox organized. However, research shows that creating complex folder structures does not necessarily lead to higher efficiency in retrieving emails. The process of manually sorting emails into specific folders takes a lot of time and effort (an average of 67 hours per year!), and these preparatory actions often turn out to be inefficient. Instead of spending time categorizing each email, this time can be better spent on other productive tasks.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to use a single archive folder for all emails. This method utilizes the powerful search functions that are available in most email programs today. By simply searching for keywords, senders, or dates, users can quickly and effectively retrieve the necessary emails without the need for an extensive folder structure. This not only reduces the time spent organizing emails, but also increases the speed and efficiency of retrieving information.</p>
<p>Additionally, data supports the idea of opportunistic access, where people who rely on search and threading features have more success in finding emails than those who use complex folder structures. This suggests that using a single archive folder, combined with search functionality, is a more practical and efficient approach to email management. It not only simplifies the process, but also utilizes modern technology to increase productivity.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Psychologist Carol Dweck <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20876879/">has discovered</a> that how we think about willpower affects how tired we feel after making decisions. People who believe their willpower is quickly depleted often feel exhausted after a difficult task. However, those who believe that willpower is not quickly depleted are less affected and may even perform better after a challenge.</p>
<p>This idea is related to Dweck&rsquo;s theory of the &ldquo;fixed mindset&rdquo; and the &ldquo;growth mindset.&rdquo; People with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities and resources, such as willpower, are fixed and limited. This can cause them to become tired more quickly and give up more easily when faced with problems. People with a growth mindset believe they can grow and that their willpower can be replenished, allowing them to better handle difficult situations.</p>
<p>To believe that willpower is not limited, you can start by challenging this thought. This can be done by achieving small successes in situations where you would normally give up, and using these successes as evidence that your willpower is stronger than you thought. It is important to realize that the moment just before giving up is often the hardest, but pushing through can lead to a change in your way of thinking and a stronger belief in your own resilience.</p>

			 <p>It is important to keep essential knowledge at hand so you can use it immediately when needed. This means training your brain to recognize and remember important information, allowing you to respond faster and better in different situations. This process helps you become less dependent on external tools because you already know a lot yourself.</p>
<p>An important part of this is actively engaging with information. This means not just reading or hearing information, but also working with it by discussing it, trying it out, and applying it in different situations. This helps you remember the information better. It is an ongoing process of learning and repetition, training your brain to recognize patterns and automatically come up with solutions. This way, you can act quickly without first having to search for information.</p>
<p>While digital tools can be handy, it is important to first make the most of your own brain. This means investing time and effort in truly understanding the information you encounter. By filling your brain with knowledge and actively using it, you build a strong foundation that allows you to respond quickly and effectively to new challenges and situations.</p>

<p>My personal rule is that this list can contain a maximum of 5 episodes. If this threshold is passed, I will delete the least interesting episodes to get down to 5.</p>

			 <p>David Allen, the creator of GTD, says there is no standard way to use his method. Although his books and workshops provide a lot of explanations, it is important for everyone to create their own system that suits their needs and preferences. The goal of GTD is to get tasks and responsibilities out of your head, so you have space for creative and productive thinking. This works best when the system you use fits you well and feels easy.</p>
<p>Adapting your GTD system means trying out what works for you. This may mean setting reminders for things that interest you or developing habits that help you feel better. The most important thing is that GTD is not about strictly following rules, but about creating a system that helps you clear your mind. Whether you use an app or a paper notebook, it&rsquo;s about finding a way that helps you stay organized and focused.</p>

			 <p>It may sound surprising, but research shows that while people without stress are less likely to have chronic illnesses and often feel better, they also perform worse on tests that measure memory and cognitive flexibility. It seems that a little stress can help keep our brains sharp. Stress acts as a kind of training for the brain, allowing us to use our cognitive skills better and more efficiently.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should always be stressed to think well. It&rsquo;s about finding the right balance. A little stress can help us be more productive and think better, but too much stress can lead to negative feelings and be bad for our health. People with stress also give and receive emotional support more often, which can lead to a richer social life. Therefore, it is important to find a level of stress that keeps us alert without harming our health.</p>

			 <p>Our productivity problems, such as information overload from emails and chat messages, may seem like a modern issue, but they are not new. As early as 1916, similar problems were discussed, showing that this has been an ongoing issue. Often, this is due to poor management of information and communication. Great thinkers have long ago devised solutions for these issues. By looking at their ideas, we can learn how to better handle our current problems.</p>
<p>Thinkers from the past, such as Aristotle and Seneca, and later figures like Peter Drucker, have written extensively about working efficiently, managing time well, and how we easily get distracted. They often emphasize the importance of focusing, setting priorities, and managing time effectively. These ideas are still useful and can help us better handle the constant stream of notifications and information. By following their advice, we can become more productive and find a better balance between work and leisure.</p>
<p>It is important to learn from the past and apply the wisdom of these thinkers to our modern work. This means not only studying their strategies but also adapting them to how we work today. By listening to these experts and learning from their insights, we can find ways to work more effectively and with greater satisfaction, despite the challenges of today&rsquo;s technology.</p>

			 <p>I still haven&rsquo;t found the perfect work-from-home coffee break activity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for something which I can do while drinking my coffee, which will disconnect my mind from work and which can be completed in about 15‚Äì20 minutes.</p>
<p>I found that the activity should have a definite end point as I tried reading and gaming, which had the tendency to expend my break with at least an hour.</p>

			 <p>My plan was to take a short break, cross the street to buy some pineapple in the vegetable store and then drink my coffee while continue to work, but when I came back decided to play ‚Äòjust one game of MTGA‚Äô‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I managed to limit myself to play just this one game (mainly because I won), but then looked up some information about the MTGA and updated my <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/now">Now page</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, I had to write this down on my daily page in my diary, and while I&rsquo;m at it, why don&rsquo;t I publish this note also on my blog?</p>

			 <p>It is good to spend some time planning your day, tidying up your inbox, and setting goals. This helps you clearly see what you need to do and how to approach it. But be careful not to lose too much time on these preparations. Overplanning can lead to procrastination and spending more time thinking than doing.</p>
<p>Finding the right balance between planning and doing is important for your productivity. It can be tempting to plan everything in detail, but often it&rsquo;s better to quickly make a list of your most important tasks and start right away. You usually already know what is important to you; it&rsquo;s about writing down these priorities and then taking action. By getting started immediately, you prevent getting stuck in endless preparations and can use your energy to achieve real results.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2022/01/27/teaching-online-with.html">Teaching online with the cameras turned off</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2022/01/27/teaching-online-with.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-01-27 10:05:59 &#43;0100">Jan 27, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This tweet caught my eye this morning:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The issue of turned off cameras in zoom classes is, as many other issues, nuanced.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides in online workshops and can sympathise with both the teacher and the students.</p>
<p>A student might not have the fancy videoconference gear I have, nor a nice background. Maybe they are in their bedroom, maybe there are other people around‚Ä¶ They simply are trying to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>As a trainer, I have only once faced a completely blacked out camera grid while giving my workshop and it was hard.</p>
<p>Without any visual o audible feedback, you don&rsquo;t know whether the participants understand you, whether you have the right rhythm and speed, whether the participants air high in energy or need a break‚Ä¶</p>
<p>However, a good training, whether online or in person, is interactive. The days of the teacher giving a masterclass have long gone. Nowadays we know that learning takes effort and time together is valuable. If a teacher uses this valuable time only to pass information, he or she could better have recorded a video or send the information in written form. Being together does add nothing if there is no interaction.</p>
<p>Rather than passing information, a teacher should use the online session to answer questions, to work in groups on assignments, to discuss‚Ä¶</p>
<p>When the session flows and is interactive, the lack of turned on cameras will be no issue anymore.</p>
<p>And as a last resort, you can also ask a colleague to connect to the session with the camera on, so you hace at least one face to talk to.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2021/11/25/i-purchased-the.html">I purchased the new Oura ring</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A little over three years ago I gifted myself the <a href="https://ouraring.com/taf/dcc3320c00">Oura ring</a>. It served me very well, until the battery got damaged a few months ago after which it needed to be charged every two days. Fortunately, Oura has great service and they replaced my ring.</p>
<p>A few weeks after I received the replacement ring, Oura announced the third generation of the ring, with more and better sensors.</p>
<p>The minimalist in me decided that I have no need for a new ring. After all, mine was just replaced and should last several years without issues. Also, I don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> the ring, it is just something nice to have.</p>
<p>However, with the new ring, Oura also launched a subscription service to access the data gathered by this new ring. The previous model, which I have, does not need a subscription to access the same data. That is one more reason <strong>not</strong> to upgrade, but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I really like having an Oura ring and probably will replace my current ring with a new one once it wears down in a few years. And then I will have to pay the monthly subscription, unless‚Ä¶</p>
<p>If I upgrade now, I am eligible for a lifetime membership, saving a lot of money every  year. Today I made the calculation: If I would like to wear an Oura ring for four more years, it makes sense to upgrade now, so I will save money on the subscription.</p>
<p>It is not what I planned to do, but it makes sense to me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday my father (84 years old) was writing a text message to his friends. While he composed his message, he complained that the order of the keys on the keyboard made no sense to him.</p>
<p>Of course, he never learned to type and never used a computer. ‚ÄúWhy don&rsquo;t they put the letters in alphabetical order?‚Äù
I guess he is right. The QWERTY layout makes sense when you type with all fingers, but probably is not the most efficient layout on small screens.</p>
<p>Immediately a thought came up in my head: ‚ÄùThere&rsquo;s an app for that‚Äú. And yes, you can install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/es/app/abcdef-keyboard/id1465367757?l=en">an alternative keyboard</a> with all letters in alphabetical order for only 0,99‚Ç¨.</p>
<p>To save my father the hassle of purchasing an app, I thought it would be best is I gifted the app. I initiated the process, but quickly ran into a wall, since Apple does not allow me to gift app from my Spanish Apple account to a Dutch Apple account. It surprised me, since we live in a global world‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Up to plan B. I asked my father for his phone and proceeded to purchase the keyboard app. Of course, my father never purchased any app, so I had to set up a payment method for his account. Apple offers several options here:</p>
<p>First there is the credit card/debit card. My father does not have a credit card, but does have a credit card. However, his card number is alphanumerical and the interface only allowed me to enter numbers. So I tried my credit card, but again, Apple won&rsquo;t allow a Spanish credit card be used for a Dutch account.</p>
<p>Then there was the option to use PayPal, which obviously my father hasn&rsquo;t got either.</p>
<p>Next in the list was the option to pay be telephone on selected carriers (of course, no mention of which those selected carriers are). I entered my father&rsquo;s phone number and pressed OK, but nothing happened. I assume that my father&rsquo;s carrier is not one of the selected carriers, but there was no error message at all.</p>
<p>Finally on the list was iDeal, a protocol developed by the Dutch banks specially for online purchases. My father&rsquo;s bank account does support iDeal, but he has never activated it. But my mother did, so the next plan is to have her purchase the app and then install it through family sharing.</p>
<p>I took my mother&rsquo;s phone, and tried to purchase the app, but got an error message telling me that I did not have enough balance on the Apple account. What?</p>
<p>After looking around a little bit, I found out that Apple had not implemented iDeal as a payment method, as most online stores do, but rather as a method to top up the balance on the Apple Account.</p>
<p>So I proceeded to use iDeal to get money on my mother&rsquo;s account. I transferred the minimum amount (1‚Ç¨), got passed to the banking app, accepted the transaction and got sent back to the App Store, which gave me an erro message. I tried it once more, with the same result. I checked the bank status and effectively saw that I had paid two times an euro to Apple.</p>
<p>5 Minutes later the balance of my mother&rsquo;s account updated and I could finally purchase the keyboard app.</p>
<p>Now I just have to install it on my father&rsquo;s phone. They have family sharing activated, but I could not see my mother&rsquo;s purchases from my father&rsquo;s phone. For that, I had to activate App sharing in the family sharing settings. And when I did that, I got an error message. In order to activate app sharing, you&rsquo;ll need a valid payment method‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I tried, and I tried and even though my mother has Apple Pay, iDeal and a positive balance on het Apple account, according to Apple she has no payment method configured, so there is no way to transfer her purchases to my father&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>What seemed a good idea, spend 0,99‚Ç¨ to gift an app to my father, ended up wasting almost an hour of time without being able to purchase the app.</p>
<p>This should not be so difficult Apple!</p>
<p>In the end, I spent another hour to teach my father how to send voice messages s he doesn&rsquo;t have to search for the keys on the keyboard.</p>

			 <p>The idea is to start with something simple that works and then, if necessary, add more complex elements. This is similar to minimalism, where you try to avoid unnecessary complications. By starting with a simple system, you can better see what works well and what doesn&rsquo;t, and you can make improvements step by step without disrupting the foundation.</p>
<p>In systems thinking, it is often said that successful complex systems usually evolve from simple systems that already worked well. This means that designing a complex system from scratch often causes problems and inefficiencies. It is smarter to start with a simple system that works and gradually expand it. This way, you can identify and improve weak spots without the risk of everything collapsing.</p>
<p>It is important not to overcomplicate and to avoid unnecessary organization when applying this principle. Often, it is better to just start and add extra elements later. This prevents you from getting stuck in planning and organizing, and gives you the flexibility to respond to changes and new ideas. By starting small and slowly adding more, you build a strong and flexible system that can grow and adapt to future needs.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2021/11/02/people-with-a.html">People with a wandering mind (ADHD) are motivated by actions that captivate, create, compete, or complete</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2021/11/02/people-with-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-11-02 17:52:00 &#43;0100">Nov 2, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>People with ADHD are often motivated by activities that captivate them, stimulate creativity, ignite competition, or provide a sense of completion. This is because traditional external motivators, such as rewards and punishments, are often less effective for people with ADHD. Their minds tend towards intrinsic motivation, where the activity itself must be attractive and stimulating to hold their attention. Actions that captivate, such as exciting or new tasks, can pique their interest and help them stay focused.</p>
<p>Creative activities provide another source of motivation for people with ADHD. The process of creating, whether it be art, writing, or coming up with new ideas, can help channel their thoughts and use their energy in a productive way. Creativity provides an outlet for their often overactive mind and can give them a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Competition and completing tasks are also powerful motivators.</p>
<p>Competitive situations, whether it be sports, games, or work-related challenges, can hold the attention of people with ADHD through the excitement and desire to win. Similarly, completing tasks, no matter how small, can give a sense of achievement and satisfaction, motivating them to continue and set new goals. These intrinsic motivators help people with ADHD stay focused and productive, despite their tendency towards a wandering mind.</p>

			 <p>It is important to determine in advance when you want to stop a task, work session or project. This helps you stay focused and efficient. By setting a clear stop moment, you prevent yourself from overworking. If you know in advance when you want to stop, you can plan and prioritize better. This leads to more productivity and less stress. In addition, you prevent yourself from taking on too much work, which often happens when people are too optimistic about what they can do in a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>An important part of this approach is using time as a way to measure attention. Attention is limited and difficult to measure, but time is easy to measure. By using time as a benchmark, you can organize your work better. This idea is in line with Parkinson&rsquo;s law, which states that work takes up the time available for it. By setting a clear end time, you force yourself to work more efficiently and prevent tasks from taking longer than necessary. This also helps to reduce indecision, as you spend less time constantly re-planning and prioritizing.</p>
<p>Finally, by scheduling a stop moment, you can better deal with interruptions and unexpected events. This helps you find a balance between work and rest, which is important for long-term productivity and well-being. It is a simple but effective way to organize your work day and ensure that you achieve your goals without overworking yourself.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/scan/nsv066">Research shows</a> that regularly practicing mindfulness meditation can lead to a smaller amygdala. This part of the brain is important because a smaller amygdala often means you have less stress and can concentrate better. When the amygdala is less active, we are less easily distracted by things around us or by our own thoughts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, studies indicate that mindfulness meditation not only changes the size of the amygdala but also how it interacts with other parts of the brain. This means that the amygdala communicates differently with, for example, the prefrontal cortex. These changes help us manage our emotions better and concentrate more effectively. As a result, people procrastinate less often because they can focus their attention better on what they need to do.</p>
<p>The great thing about mindfulness meditation is that you don&rsquo;t need much time or effort to experience these benefits. Research shows that even a short, intensive period of mindfulness, such as a three-day retreat, can cause lasting changes in the brain. This means that mindfulness meditation is an easy and effective way to improve your mental clarity and focus. It is therefore a valuable practice for anyone struggling with concentration and procrastination.</p>

			 <p>Research has shown that higher CO2 levels in office environments are associated with decreased performance on cognitive tests, such as the Stroop test, and an increase in reaction times for attention disorders. This suggests that a well-ventilated work environment is not only important for health, but also for maintaining mental sharpness and productivity.</p>
<p>A productive work environment requires more than just a well-designed space; air quality plays an equally important role. Poor air quality, caused by high concentrations of CO2 and particles, can lead to decreased concentration and cognitive abilities. Therefore, it is essential that workspaces are well-ventilated to keep the air clean and optimize mental performance.</p>

			 <p>Research by Hershfield and colleagues, based on data from 35,000 people, shows that a lack of free time leads to increased stress and lower subjective well-being. This is not surprising, as too little time for relaxation and personal activities can result in a feeling of exhaustion and dissatisfaction. However, the research also reveals that too much free time is not always better. From about five hours of free time per day, well-being starts to decline again, unless this time is filled with social activities.</p>
<p>Free time is essential for rest and recovery, but an excess can lead to a sense of purposelessness. This is because a large part of our free time is often consumed by distractions such as mobile phones and social media, which can ultimately feel like wasted time. It is important to find a balance where free time is not only sufficient for relaxation, but also spent meaningfully. This can be achieved, for example, by engaging in activities that promote personal growth or stimulate social interactions.</p>

			 <p>Regular thinking walks can have a significant positive impact on your brain, thinking, creativity and memory. Research shows that walking, especially in the morning, not only increases your energy level, but also improves your creativity and problem-solving ability. An experiment conducted by Oppezzo at Stanford University showed that students who walked before taking a creativity test scored 60 percent higher on creativity scores than those who sat. This suggests that physical activity such as walking stimulates the brain and promotes new ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>In addition, walking in nature offers additional benefits. The Attention Restoration Theory suggests that natural environments can restore your attention and refresh your mind, contributing to improved memory and concentration. The lower temperatures and fresh air in the morning can also have a invigorating effect, promoting your mental clarity and discipline throughout the day. While walking in the city also offers benefits, the peace and beauty of nature can add an extra dimension of relaxation and inspiration. It is important to experiment with different environments and activities, such as listening to music or podcasts, to discover what works best for your personal productivity and well-being.</p>

			 <p>In our modern world, we often receive a lot of information that is easy to understand but doesn&rsquo;t really help us gain deeper knowledge. It&rsquo;s tempting to view reading as something passive, like watching TV or YouTube videos, especially when we&rsquo;re tired. But to truly benefit from the information, it&rsquo;s important to consciously set aside time where we can fully concentrate on reading. This means avoiding distractions and focusing on understanding the text.</p>
<p>Quality time for reading means not only reading the words but also actively thinking about what they mean. This can be aided by taking notes, which enhances our attention and focus. By taking notes, we force ourselves to rephrase and better understand the text in our own words. This helps us remember and apply the information in different situations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to find the right moments for this kind of reading. Instead of reading when we&rsquo;re tired, it&rsquo;s better to choose times when we are alert and open to new information. This might mean scheduling specific times for deep reading, away from hustle and distractions. By valuing these moments, we can improve our reading and move from superficial information processing to building valuable knowledge.</p>

			 <p>Irreversible decisions, also known as &ldquo;one-way doors,&rdquo; require careful and thoughtful consideration. It is important to thoroughly assess the situation and seek advice if necessary before making a decision that cannot be undone. This helps prevent regret and ensures you don&rsquo;t end up in an undesirable situation.</p>
<p>Some decisions are permanent, but there are also many decisions you can reverse, the so-called &ldquo;two-way doors.&rdquo; These decisions can be made more quickly and with less concern because the consequences are not final. If such a decision doesn&rsquo;t work out well, you can go back and try something else. It&rsquo;s important to know what type of decision you are making so you can use your time and energy wisely.</p>
<p>Take your time with important decisions. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be indecisive, but rather think consciously and smartly. By calmly considering the consequences and risks, you can make decisions with more confidence. This helps prevent mistakes and gives you a sense of control and responsibility over your choices and their impact on your life.</p>

<p>Most people perform worse when they try to do multiple things at once. This is because the human brain has difficulty dividing its attention well over different tasks. Research has shown that multitasking often leads to less productivity and more errors. But there is a small group of 2.5% of people who can multitask well. They seem to have a special ability to use their attention and thinking skills efficiently.</p>
<p>The ability to do multiple things at once without performing worse varies from person to person and can be seen as a skill that can be developed. Most people cannot multitask well, but the fact that 2.5% of people can shows that there are different levels of multitasking.</p>

			 <p>Meals that are high in carbohydrates can affect our reaction speed. This is because carbohydrates can increase the production of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that has a calming effect, which can lead to relaxation and less alertness. This can be useful if you want to relax, but it can be a disadvantage if you need to react quickly, such as when driving or performing difficult tasks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, meals high in protein can distract you more quickly. Proteins contain amino acids like tyrosine that stimulate the production of dopamine and norepinephrine. These substances help you stay alert and focused, but too much of them can cause you to become more easily distracted and have trouble concentrating. This can be particularly challenging in situations where you need to pay attention and stay focused for a long time.</p>
<p>It is important to find a good balance between carbohydrates and proteins, depending on what you are going to do. If you need to do something that requires good concentration and quick reactions, it may help to eat fewer carbohydrates and opt for a meal with a bit more protein. On the other hand, if you are going to do something that requires less concentration, a meal high in carbohydrates can help you feel relaxed and calm.</p>

			 <p>When constantly switching from one task to another, so-called &lsquo;switching costs&rsquo; arise. These costs include the time and mental energy needed to reorient yourself to the new task, let go of the details of the previous task (attention residue), and fully concentrate on the new task. This process can take several minutes, which means that frequent task switching can lead to a significant decrease in productivity.</p>
<p>By handling tasks sequentially instead of in parallel, these switching costs can be minimized. Once you start a task, it is more efficient to continue it for as long as possible until it is completed. This eliminates the need to switch constantly and allows you to fully focus on the task at hand. Research has shown that subjects who repeatedly perform the same task work faster and more efficiently than when constantly switching tasks.</p>
<p>Additionally, studies have shown that employees lose a significant portion of their time by frequently switching between applications and websites. This constant switching can lead to a loss of 9% of their working time. By consciously choosing to monotask and handle tasks in a logical order, employees can increase their productivity and improve the quality of their work. It is therefore crucial to create a work environment where unnecessary interruptions are minimized and focus on one task at a time is promoted.</p>

			 <p>Taking the time to think about, dream of, and look forward to future activities is an essential part of happiness and satisfaction in life. Research suggests that not only the memory of positive events, but also the anticipation of future events plays a significant role in our overall well-being. By consciously spending time planning and visualizing future activities, we can create a sense of excitement and anticipation that enriches our daily lives.</p>
<p>The process of anticipation offers us the opportunity to mentally prepare and enjoy the anticipation. This can range from planning a vacation to looking forward to a dinner with friends. It is important not to underestimate these moments of anticipation, as they make a significant contribution to our joy in life. By regularly taking the time to dream about future activities, we can provide ourselves with a source of constant joy and motivation.</p>
<p>Additionally, consciously thinking about future activities can help us to be more focused and purposeful. It allows us to determine our priorities and direct our time and energy towards what is truly important to us. This can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life, where we not only enjoy the activities themselves, but also the journey towards them. In short, taking the time to dream and look forward to the future is a valuable investment in our own happiness and well-being.</p>

			 <p>Linking desired behavior to a clear cue is a smart way to change behavior. This idea is similar to making &ldquo;if-then&rdquo; plans, where you decide in advance what you will do in a particular situation. By choosing a clear cue that reminds you of the desired behavior, it becomes easier to exhibit this behavior automatically and regularly. This works like a habit: the cue triggers a routine that provides a reward, encouraging you to repeat the behavior.</p>
<p>Implementation intentions help you achieve your goals by making desired behavior happen automatically. By deciding in advance what you will do in a certain situation, it becomes easier to stick to your plans. For example, you might decide to meditate for five minutes every morning after brushing your teeth. Brushing your teeth then becomes the cue to start meditating, making it a fixed part of your daily routine.</p>
<p>By automating behavior with clear signals and specific plans, the process becomes more predictable and requires less mental energy. This leaves more room for other tasks, which can improve your productivity and effectiveness. By linking desired behavior to a clear signal, it becomes easier to develop and maintain positive habits. This increases the likelihood of achieving your personal and professional goals.</p>

			 <p>The basic principle of the Getting Things Done (GTD) system, developed by David Allen, is that your memory is not the right tool for keeping track of your to-do list. As long as you have a good system that systematically gets tasks out of your head, your system meets this basic principle. This means that you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to organize tasks by context, follow the five steps, or do weekly maintenance.</p>
<p>David Allen emphasizes that anything that helps to get something out of someone&rsquo;s head and creates more cognitive space and freedom to be present and focus your attention where you want, without distraction, could also be GTD. For example, <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2018/07/is-there-anything-besides-gtd/">if you could hire 40 people to follow you everywhere</a> and to whom you can entrust all ideas or future reminders, and who can guide you through every thinking process at the right time, then you don&rsquo;t need any additional tool or process. That would also be GTD.</p>

			 <p>When people can easily understand information, for example through good sound quality, it positively influences their trust in that information. This is because smooth and clear communication creates a sense of reliability. When information is presented without glitches or disturbances, listeners experience less cognitive load, meaning they have to exert less effort to process the message. This ease leads people to more quickly consider the information as true and reliable.</p>
<p>Research has shown that when information is difficult to process, for example due to poor sound quality or a strong accent, people are more likely to judge the information as less true or convincing. This effect occurs even when the difficulty arises from insignificant features, such as the color of the text or the pronunciation of a name. The idea is that anything that makes processing information difficult creates a barrier to the trust people have in that information.</p>
<p>Good sound quality and clear communication thus play a crucial role in how information is received and evaluated. By ensuring that information is easy to understand, speakers and organizations can increase the trust of their audience. This underscores the importance of attention to detail in communication, such as the clarity of the audio and the articulation of the speaker, to have a positive impact on how the message is received.</p>

			 <p>A Zettelkasten is a flexible system in which you write down and connect ideas and thoughts in an organized way. This helps you think better by combining reading and writing. By putting your thoughts on paper, you build a network of knowledge that helps you rediscover and use old insights.</p>
<p>The idea of a Zettelkasten as a conversation partner means that you have an equal relationship with your notes. Your Zettelkasten is a reliable partner that helps you organize and develop your thoughts. In turn, you add new information and insights to the system. This collaboration ensures that your Zettelkasten is not just a place to store things, but also an active part of your thinking process that helps you explore and understand complex ideas.</p>
<p>According to Niklas Luhmann, one cannot think well without writing. Writing helps to clarify differences and important points that are embedded in ideas. By writing, you create a reliable partner in your notes that helps process information consistently. This forms a solid foundation for further developing knowledge. In this way, your Zettelkasten becomes a living archive that helps you grow intellectually.</p>

			 <p>Large organizations often try to place employees in fixed roles. These roles are usually intended for the average employee and not for people driven by passion and the desire to excel. As a result, passionate employees may feel limited in their ability to fully utilize their talents. The structures and processes within large organizations are often focused on efficiency and predictability, which can lead to an environment where innovation and personal involvement are less encouraged.</p>
<p>Sometimes the organization and an enthusiastic employee have different goals. What a manager may find unimportant can be very important to the employee. This difference can cause the employee to feel frustrated and undervalued. If their hard work is not noticed or appreciated, it can reduce their motivation and engagement.</p>
<p>Finally, enthusiastic employees may feel excluded in large companies. They may think that their ideas are ignored or viewed with suspicion. This can cause them to withdraw or even leave to find a place where their enthusiasm is appreciated. Therefore, it is important for large companies to create an environment where passion and innovation are encouraged, so that employees can develop and contribute to the company&rsquo;s success.</p>

			 <p>Use a large screen on which you can see both your work document and your reference material side by side. This way, you need to switch between windows less often. This makes it easier to concentrate and helps you work more efficiently.</p>
<p>The idea that a larger screen can increase your productivity comes from being able to see more information at once. This helps you work faster and better, especially if the information is important for what you are doing. With a larger screen, you can, for example, view a document and other necessary information side by side. This allows you to look things up more quickly and reduces the need to search for what you need.</p>

			 <p>Feedback is a useful tool that helps people and organizations improve and grow. It is important to see feedback as an opportunity to learn, even if it sometimes feels uncomfortable or difficult. By appreciating feedback, you create a safe environment where people dare to express their opinions without fear of negative reactions. This ensures good communication and collaboration, which is important for success.</p>
<p>When giving feedback, it is important to do so in a positive and thoughtful manner. Feedback should be intended to help the other person and should be practical so that the recipient can actually do something with it. Also, consider the right timing and manner of giving feedback so that it is well received. By carefully considering the feedback you give, you show respect for the other person and contribute to a culture of understanding and improvement.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that feedback is just a suggestion and you can choose what to do with it. It is normal to sometimes feel attacked when receiving feedback, but try to understand that the other person wants to help you. By being open to feedback and appreciating it, even if you disagree with it, you can grow and improve your skills. The ability to accept and use feedback is a sign of maturity and an important step in your personal development.</p>

			 <p>It is important to connect your notes with each other so that you can build a network of ideas and insights. This helps you not only to store information but also to truly understand and integrate it into your own thought patterns. By linking notes together, you create a system where ideas are related rather than isolated. This ensures that you understand things better and generate new ideas because you actively seek connections and patterns between different pieces of information.</p>
<p>Connecting notes is like having a conversation with your own thoughts. This is similar to the Zettelkasten method, where notes serve as building blocks for a larger whole. By linking notes together, you create a network that helps you organize and deepen your thoughts. This network works like a memory palace, where you can always return to earlier ideas to expand or adjust them. It is a way to actively maintain your knowledge and ensure that it remains useful and applicable.</p>
<p>Connecting notes helps you deepen your knowledge. When you truly understand a new idea and add it to what you already know, it becomes a useful tool in your daily life. This requires discipline and perseverance, as you need to look beyond just first impressions and superficial connections. By actively seeking related notes and merging them, you create a system that ensures important ideas and insights remain vibrant and easily accessible.</p>

			 <p>When you help someone, it is important to provide them with enough information so they can move forward. This doesn&rsquo;t mean overwhelming them with details, but sharing the key points and useful knowledge they need to progress.</p>
<p>In addition to providing information, it is important to boost the person&rsquo;s confidence. This can be done by showing how the knowledge they gain can help not only them but also others. When people see that their knowledge and skills can positively impact others, they often feel more motivated and confident. This can be achieved, for example, by encouraging them to give advice to friends, which not only deepens their own understanding but also increases their confidence.</p>
<p>In training sessions and workshops, encouraging mutual advice can be a powerful way to enhance participants' confidence and motivation. By giving participants the opportunity to share their knowledge and help others, they discover their own skills and the value they can offer. This not only aids their own learning process but also fosters a culture of collaboration and support, ultimately leading to a more engaged and confident group of people.</p>

			 <p>Most decisions in life are not final. These decisions, also known as Type 2 decisions, can easily be reversed if they do not yield the desired result. This is different from Type 1 decisions, which have consequences that are difficult or impossible to reverse. By acting quickly on decisions that can be reversed, we can save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on overthinking and analyzing.</p>
<p>The Pareto principle, which states that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts, can help with this. Instead of striving for complete certainty, which is often not possible, we can make decisions based on the most important 20% of information we have. This makes the decision-making process faster and allows us to act and learn from the results more quickly.</p>
<p>Taking quick decisions that can easily be reversed gives us the opportunity to test what works and what doesn&rsquo;t in practice. Often, you only truly know if a decision is good when you try it out. If the result is not good, you can easily adjust or reverse the decision. This process of deciding, testing, and adjusting allows for a flexible approach, enabling us to make progress faster and respond better to changes.</p>

			 <p>When you rewrite a text in your own words, you have to think carefully about what is written and what it means. This helps you to understand the main ideas and arguments of the writer and to express them in a way that is clear to you. By doing this, you gain a better understanding of the text because you are not just reading, but also actively engaging with the information.</p>
<p>Rephrasing helps you to better understand a text. Just like with modern art, it is important to know what the writer means and in what context the text was written. By repeating a text in your own words, you think about the context and how it connects to what you already know. This can give you new insights and help you to better understand the writer&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>Finally, rewriting a text helps you to learn better and understand its meaning. It gives you the opportunity to engage in a conversation with the writer and discover what he or she means. By actively engaging with the text, you cannot only understand it better but also appreciate it and add it to what you already know. This makes reading an engaging and educational experience, where you not only absorb information but also build new knowledge.</p>

			 <p>Multitasking means trying to do multiple things at once. This causes your attention to be divided, making it harder to focus on one task. When your attention is divided, you are more likely to make mistakes or miss important details. As a result, you often have to spend more time correcting these mistakes, which makes you less productive. Research shows that most people are not good at multitasking without their work suffering.</p>
<p>Multitasking can also lead to &ldquo;attention residue.&rdquo; This means that when you switch from one task to another, part of your attention remains on the previous task. This makes it harder to fully concentrate on the new task, reducing your efficiency. Constantly switching between tasks can also be tiring, making it harder to think clearly and make good decisions.</p>
<p>To be more productive, it is often better to focus on one task at a time, also known as monotasking. By giving your full attention to one task, you can complete it faster and with fewer errors. This means not only finishing faster but also producing higher quality work. Although some people are good at multitasking, this is not true for most people. Therefore, it is usually better to avoid multitasking for tasks that require a lot of attention..</p>

			 <p>When you write information in your own words, you really need to understand what it is about. This helps you remember the information better and form your own opinion. It is an active way to engage with new ideas, rather than just reading what others have written.</p>
<p>It is important to use your own words because there is a big difference between highlighting text and writing down your own thoughts. Highlighting and making notes usually happens while reading, but taking notes happens while thinking. By using your own words, you move from passive reading to active thinking. This helps you think more deeply about what you read and gain new ideas and insights that you might otherwise miss.</p>
<p>Additionally, writing down your thoughts in your own words can help you clarify and better understand your ideas. Writing forces you to organize your thoughts, which can lead to a better understanding of difficult topics. It also helps you convey your own opinions and arguments more clearly. In short, using your own words to express your thoughts is important for personal and intellectual growth.</p>

			 <p>This happens because the things you see influence how you feel. Seeing others working hard reminds you to stay focused yourself. This idea is often used in places like libraries and cafes, where people work together and create a productive atmosphere.</p>
<p>When you see others working hard, it can make you feel like you need to work harder too. This is because you feel responsible and experience social pressure. Research shows that people try harder when they see others performing a difficult task. Working in an environment with focused people can help you concentrate better and be more productive. Therefore, try working in a coffee shop or library, where you are surrounded by others who are also working.</p>

			 <p>Research into the use of sit-stand desks shows that these desks do not directly lead to higher productivity at work. Although they are popular for reducing the drawbacks of prolonged sitting, they have little impact on how well people perform their tasks.</p>
<p>However, sit-stand desks can help create a healthier work environment by offering the option to alternate between sitting and standing. This can lead to a better work experience and well-being, which may have a positive impact on productivity in the long term. For immediate productivity improvement, other factors such as work processes and technology are likely more important.</p>

			 <p>Three core principles of effectiveness and productivity. It starts with identifying the right tasks that contribute to your goals and priorities. This means being able to distinguish what is truly important from what merely seems urgent. The concept of &ldquo;do the right things&rdquo; comes into play here, where you focus on tasks that have the greatest impact on your long-term goals.</p>
<p>Next, it is crucial to execute these tasks in the right way. This involves using methods and techniques that are efficient and effective. For example, by starting with simple steps and gradually adding complexity, you can better manage and complete the task. It is also important to minimize interruptions and focus on one task at a time, as multitasking reduces productivity.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to find the right timing to perform these tasks. This means planning your workday so that you tackle the most demanding tasks when your energy and concentration are at their peak. It is also helpful to group tasks and complete them in batches to increase efficiency. By finding a balance between focused work and adequate free time, you can maximize your productivity without burnout. Finding the right timing helps you to be consistently and sustainably productive.</p>

			 <p>When making yearly or quarterly plans, I always fail to account for my diminished productivity in august due to the really hot afternoons.</p>

			 <p>All my Apple devices are relatively old. My philosophy is to use them as long as I reasonably can.</p>
<p>This also means that usually after the WWDC I only have one burning question: will I be able to update my devices?</p>
<p>Last year, Apple did not include my late 2013 iMac in the list, so it still runs Catalina (not an issue so far).</p>
<p>This year there will be no casualties.</p>
<p>I will be able to update my iPhone 7; even the 6S is still supported so it looks like I will be able to reach the 6 year usage target.</p>
<p>Also my iPad Air 2 is updatable, even though it is tha last device on the list so this will probably be the last update.</p>
<p>Historically there has been a lot of talk about Apple‚Äôs planned obsolescence and even though the devices are hard to service by third-parties, six years of OS updates is very good.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I finally did something I should done several years ago: spring cleaning my personal effectiveness blog <a href="https://canasto.es">El Canasto</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I removed several ancient landing pages.</li>
<li>I updated the <a href="https://canasto.es/aviso-legal">privacy policy</a>.</li>
<li>I created a brand new <a href="https://canasto.es/acerca">About</a> page.</li>
<li>I set up a (still unpublished) page for an upcoming podcast.</li>
<li>I added the obligatory GDPR disclaimer to several forms.</li>
<li>I removed a dysfunctional piece of JavaScript from the header code.</li>

			 <p>Today I received my <a href="https://www.rode.com/accessories/vxlrplus">R√òDE VXLR+</a>, a small device to connect my lavelier mic to my audio interface. The VXLR+ converts the 48V phantom power provided by the audio interface into 3‚Äì5V needed by my lavelier mic.</p>
<p>Until now I always used my lavelier mic with my phone, but for a while I‚Äôve wanted to connect it to my computer, so I have more freedom of movement when doing my online workshops.</p>
<p>However, my first attempt to use the VXLR+ was a failure since as soon as I connected it to the interface it generated a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Today I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to investigate, but tomorrow I want to try out a few things before deciding whether to return it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Whenever I want to learn something, I am highly motivated and want to start right away. If you make me wait until your next group starts, I have probably already found an alternative way to learn.</p>
<p>And the few times I did enroll in a cohort-based training I had huge difficulties following the pace of the course. They either go too fast or too slow for me, which is really frustrating. My weeks are irregular and not all your material is equally useful, so I would like to accelerate and slow down at certain moments in the course.</p>
<p>I understand the motivational benefits of going through a course together with a group of likeminded people, but those effects can be accomplished just as well (albeit with a little more effort from the course maker) by creating a community around the course.</p>

			 <p>I have been using <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for my feed reading since early 2011 (that‚Äôs over a decade!), so of course I immediately updated to version 5 last October.</p>
<p>Only now, five months later, have I started looking at the new features in this version and I really love them! üíï</p>
<p>I disconnected the app from <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> and <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> (my feed server and read later service) and started using the built-in iCloud Feeds and iCloud Read Later services.</p>
<p>But the biggest improvement is <a href="https://bionic-reading.com/en/en-insight/">Bionic Reading</a>! Added to Reeder in version 4 (2019), it looks weird but actually works! I read with more focus and attention and am less distracted.</p>
<p>I switch Bionic Reading off when I triage my feeds, but when I switch too the Read Later section I turn it on for some slow and focused reading.</p>
<p>Have you tried Bionic Reading in Reeder or any other app?</p>

			 <p>After seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BeCc_Q_ZSk">this video</a> by Shu Omi I wanted to try out the <a href="https://www.sortedapp.com/">Sorted¬≥</a> app for scheduling my tasks.</p>
<p>I see a bright future for hyperscheduling tools, since they are the easiest way to be aware of the volume of current commitments. Timeblocking can quickly turn into a rescheduling Tetris, but automated tools such as Sorted and SkedPal eliminate this issue.</p>
<p>That said, I really liked the sorted interface.  They have some innovative ways to select and modify multiple items.</p>
<p>However, there is one important feature I am missing: <strong>due dates</strong>. I can work without do dates, but being able to control my deadlines is essential for me.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I write on my iPad, there are two problems which drive me nuts. Today I will explain one of these issues.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am well aware that this is a very first-world problem, but I expect Apple to care about the little details.</p>
<p>The issue arrises when I am writing a text and need to insert a special character, such as the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign. On my iPhone I can find this symbol in a logical, easy to understand way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign is not on the main keyboard, I tap the ‚Äò123‚Äô button to go to the numerical keyboard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are some characters on this keyboard, but not the symbol I was looking for. However, where the ‚Äò123‚Äô previously was, I now see ‚Äò#+=‚Äô, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign. There it is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That was easy and intuitive. Now let&rsquo;s see what usually happens when I try to do the same basic thing on my iPad:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Though there are more characters available, the ‚Äò+‚Äô symbol is not there. Yes, I know I can swipe down the ‚Äò√ß‚Äô key, but for the sake of this argument pretend that is not the case, as not all characters are available to swipe down and my fingers fail in swiping far enough about 20% of the time.</p>
<p>Just like on the iPhone, I have a button labeled ‚Äò.?123‚Äô to get to the numerical keyboard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the numerical keyboard I once again see the ‚Äò#+=‚Äô button, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is my issue, since the ‚Äò+‚Äô button is nowhere to be seen on the third keyboard. What went wrong?
The answer is on the second screen, so lets get back:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The problem is caused by the label of the button which brings us to the special characters keyboard. The button is labeled as ‚Äò#+=‚Äô just like the iPhone, but in this case all three characters shown on the button are already on the previous keyboard.</p>
<p>If Apple would simply change the characters shown on the button to characters actually on the third keyboard (I propose ‚Äò&gt;|^‚Äô), my monkey brain would not make the mistake to press it when I&rsquo;m looking for the ‚Äò+‚Äô character.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just deleted <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a> from my phone. I have tried it for two weeks and have come to the conclusion that the platform in its current state does not provide any value to me.</p>
<p>The first week I tried using it as intended.</p>
<p>I betrayed the privacy of my contacts by uploading their information to the Clubhouse server and followed all of those who were already on the platform.</p>
<p>The first few days I listened in on a few rooms to understand how the platform works. Since about half of the rooms discuss about Clubhouse, this was easy enough. Then I went to the second stage, and once in a while, when I thought I had something useful to share I requested stage access. I even met a few new people.</p>
<p>After a week the constant stream of notifications started to bother me, so I dialled down the notification frequency to ‚ÄúVery infrequent‚Äú.</p>
<p>This week I also started thinking about why Clubhouse is such a success and why I don&rsquo;t feel it is a good fit for me.</p>
<p>First, the barrier to enter is very low. You&rsquo;re immediately welcomed by your friends, even if you didn&rsquo;t upload your contacts, since your friends already did. You can just enter and leave rooms until you find something interesting.</p>
<p>For me the biggest issue has been finding interesting rooms. It may be because of my contacts, but I found that in most rooms they talk either about what is Clubhouse, about online marketing or about both. Sometimes I found an interesting room in the ‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù list, but always at an inconvenient time. Furthermore, you can add future rooms to you calendar, but I&rsquo;d rather simply receive a notification within the app when the room starts.</p>
<p>I have met some people who spend several hours a day in Clubhouse, but that is not how I want to use social networks. I want to connect at a time that is convenient for me, and have an interesting conversation at that very moment.
Ah, and I prefer conversations with a small group of people instead of big rooms of listeners.</p>
<p>As it is right now, Clubhouse is set up as a conference center, with a few people speaking on stage and many listeners. I would prefer to see a version set up as a bar, where I can join a small table where everyone participates.</p>
<p>Until then, goodbye Clubhouse.</p>

			 <p>The past two days I have been hanging around in <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a>.</p>
<p>So far I like it, though I would like to see a broader spectrum of conversation themes. So far, since the platform is full with online marketers, the main topics are &ldquo;What is Clubhouse?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can I use this platform for marketing my business?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think audio is the perfect medium for establishing conversations, since it&rsquo;s more personal and faster to produce than written text and it&rsquo;s easier to get professional quelity than video.</p>
<p>That said, Clubhouse is a closed environment. Surely, soon there will be Clubhouse clones in many forms, but I doubt any open platform will get enough traction to pass Clubhouse as the most popular option.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to have a conversation with you on Clubhouse. You can find me as always as <a href="https://micro.blog/JeroenSangers">@JeroenSangers</a>.</p>

			 <p>Since last summer, we are in the market for a new iMac üñ• to replace a 7-year old MacBook Air üíª. The MacBook served us well for occasional work, but in the era of remote work we really need a bigger screen.</p>
<p>We prefer not to buy an Intel computer on the verge of a new architecture launch so we postponed the buying decision to today. In the unlikely event that Apple announces a new iMac with Ô£ø Silicon, we will purchase it right away. Otherwise, we won‚Äôt wait any longer and buy the current Intel-based model.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html">23 years of blogging</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-11-10 15:42:11 &#43;0100">Nov 10, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>23 years ago, I decided to add a page to my website where I explain what has been going on in my life. A few years later I learned that there was a name for such a page: a <strong>web log</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since then.</p>
<p>I have changed the blogging engine several times. The first page was made in Microsoft FrontPage, followed by hand-crafted Server Side Includes (SSI), the NewsPro CGI script and Movable Type, my favorite blogging engine of all times. Later, I decided that tweaking servers, databases and scripts was no longer a good use of my time, so I parked the blog on the hosted version of WordPress. And finally, this year I made the switch to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>Also the contents of the blogposts have changed in those years. Starting with a monthly post in Dutch summing up previous months activities in my life, I changed to writing in English when I migrated to Spain and wanted to keep an international group of friends up-to-date on my life here. When I got bored explaining my life I slowly shifted to a mixture of technology, humor, music and web standards. There also have been several years with hardly any new posts, as I focused on my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href="https://canasto.es">el Canasto</a>. As of last year, I am back to blogging again (mostly in English, but sometimes in Dutch or Spanish), (un)focused on a mixture of personal themes, interesting stuff I found on the web and some technology.</p>
<p>As for the future of this blog, seen my recent interest in publishing more (I even wish to publish daily), I think it is safe to say that the blog won‚Äôt go anywhere. Now that I have kept it alive for 23 years, I surely want to make sure to celebrate its 25th anniversary in two years.</p>

			 <p>In all the years of its existence, I have used several tools to maintain this site. From the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft FrontPage</li>
<li>NewsPro</li>
<li>Movable Type</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
</ul>
<p>Today marks the start of a new era, since I now officially joined the <a href="http://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> movement and migrated my 23-year old personal blog to <a href="http://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p>The import went flawless, and it was easy to set-up.</p>
<p>My only gripe is that I am still waiting for HTTPS to be activated, since appears to be done manually by the staff.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t request HTTPS while I haven&rsquo;t changed my DNS setting. This means that I&rsquo;m having a little bit of downtime, since all visitors will get an error message while HTTPS is not activated.</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s no issue, since I don‚Äôt get many visitors anymore (this site peaked fourteen years ago).</p>

			 <p>This morning I was checking my data in the health app, when I noticed two new sections: Symptoms and Mobility.</p>
<p>Both could be useful, but as a walking enthusiast, the Mobility metrics caught my eye:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Four of the new mobility types, <strong>Step Length</strong>, <strong>Walking Asymmetry</strong>, <strong>Walking Speed</strong>, and <strong>Double Support Time</strong> have a paragraph similar to the screenshot above.</p>
<p>That means that no external device is needed to collect this data, as long a I carry my iPhone in my pocket, which I always do.</p>
<p>One question remains though: How can I activate this function? I found no options in the settings. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait for the final release to find out‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Last week I started writing up my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personal Knowledge Management Workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as part of that workflow.</p>
<p>You know, the best notes are about note taking, just like the most popular blogs are about blogging and the most popular YouTube videos are about creating YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Back to my notes.</p>
<p>When describing the concept of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->garbage in = garbage out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†I realised that it had been ages since I pruned the RSS feeds I consult each day during breakfast.</p>
<p>So I left my notes to take a deep dive into my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inoreader<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account. This turned out to be a multi-hour project, so I chunked the task as any productive human would do.</p>
<p>Then, when checking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†between two chunks, I ran into a post called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feed Reading By Social Distance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Ton Zijlstra. I loved the idea!</p>
<p>Until now I have always organised my feeds by¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->interestingness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, using numbered folders:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After reading Tom&rsquo;s post, I first renamed all my feeds with the author name. As Tom said: feeds express a personal relation.</p>
<p>I unsubscribed from most business and group blogs, with a few exceptions for some blogs run by two or three people I know well.</p>
<p>Then I dedicated several hours to reorganise the 242 remaining feeds into social distance based folders:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While reviewing all those feeds I also made sure they are all configured to use the ‚Äòhttps‚Äô protocol, that they use the current domain name (some blogs moved from using the platform&rsquo;s subdomain to having their own domain) and to use a current feed address.</p>
<p>Speaking of the latter, it surprised me to see that several blogs, including some high volume sites, still channel their feeds through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedburner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So there we are, all feeds organised and read. Not the only thing I can do to procrastinate a bit more is write about it on my blog‚Ä¶</p>

<p>&ndash; Douglas Adams in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last Chance to See<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I am no scientific in any way, but still remember the importance of the above statement from my chemistry classes. As an example, when you want to test the pH of a liquid using a piece of litmus paper, you have to make sure that the amount of liquid is large enough to eliminate the effects of the pH change inducted by the piece of litmus paper. In other words, using litmus paper to test the pH degree of a drop of liquid has a huge error margin.</p>
<p>I have this principle in mind with most things I measure. The inclusion of a piece of JavaScript on the pages of my web site in order to have Google Analytics collect data about my visitors has an effect on the user experience: the page loads a little bit slower. However, Google&rsquo;s infrastructure is fast enough so that the increase in load time is hardly noticeable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Many Twitter users also want to measure the efficiency and popularity of their tweets. The most common method of doing this is by using an intermediate server, the &lsquo;URL shortener&rsquo;, which registers each visit to the destination site.</p>
<p>In the first years of Twitter, URL shorteners such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit.ly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were necessary to prevent long URLs from using too many of the available 140 characters in a tweet. However, in 2011Twitter implemented their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own URL shortener<!-- raw HTML omitted --> inside their service so that each URL, including the ones passed through another shortener, only use 20 characters. Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>
<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet. Once again, this was true in the past, but nowadays Twitter gives <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excellent statistics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the number of favourites, retweets and answers to each tweet on their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->statistics page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Twitter&rsquo;s own shortener and external services is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transparency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you&rsquo;re linking to if you don&rsquo;t use an external shortener &ndash; and therefore just Twitter&rsquo;s service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>
<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Single Point of Failure<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>
<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expectation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was that tweets with shortened links get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clicked less<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit.ly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>
<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service, which was invoked by adding the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>
<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chi-squared<!-- raw HTML omitted --> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <!-- raw HTML omitted -->calculate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more successful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (p = 0.0439).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not have any benefits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for me and it even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reduces clicks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>

			 <p>Version 2 of the popular OS X task management application <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Omnifocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is about to be released today. I have been testing the beta versions for some time and have seen how the software matured little by little.</p>
<p>Version 2 defers from the previous version in almost every aspect; it contains new features such as the review and forecast perspectives and also the user interface has been modernised. Especially the latter gave rise to many discussions on the support forums about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->data density of the new design<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Eventually, the Omni Group <!-- raw HTML omitted -->published a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hack<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to change the layout of the task list back to a table of tasks more similar to Omnifocus 1.</p>
<p>This made me wonder what other &lsquo;secret&rsquo; configuration options exist. So far, I have been able to compile the following list.</p>
<p>All configuration options are activated by opening a special URL starting with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in your browser, which opens Omnifocus and applies the configuration. The URLs in the list are clickable to apply the configuration directly form this post.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to switch to the compact layout, which only uses one line per task.  Note that this layout is experimental and still has some issues. To return to the default layout you can use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The alternative layout looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a perspective grouped by context, you&rsquo;ll see that empty perspectives will also show up in the main outline, to mike it easier to reassign tasks by dragging them to another context. If you would rather not see them, you can remove the empty contexts from the main outline with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can also pass the parameter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->true<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to reactivate the empty contexts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you put a project on hold, it&rsquo;s tasks will still show up in the forecast view. The reasoning is that even though the project is on hold, its tasks still have a due date. If you prefer not to see those tasks on the forecast view, disable them using <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to restore the default setting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This &lsquo;hack&rsquo; is a little bit more complicated. The issue was that the order of the perspectives in the sidebar could not be reorganised. Note that in the final release the default perspectives behave just like any other perspective, and can be organised in any way you like it. However, if you want to freak out with URL schemes, this is the way:</p>
<p>The default perspectives are on top (Inbox, Projects, Contexts&hellip;), followed by any starred perspectives. To add another perspective, you first have to star the perspective and open the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get a list of the current tabs. Note the ID of the starred perspective, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hdDT8UyDkVe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in this case:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once you know the ID of your custom perspective, you can define the order of the tabs with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whenever you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clip<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something from another application, the Quick Entry window shows up so you can specify some further meta-information about the task &ndash; project, context, dates&hellip; &ndash; and change the task description. If you would rather send the clipped information directly to the Omnifocus inbox, use the configuration URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are two setting for configuring the synchronisation interval. First, you can set the maximum sync time &ndash;in seconds &ndash; with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (this sets the maximum to 10 minutes). Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to restore the default setting of one hour.</p>
<p>The other option is for setting how long after making an edit Omnifocus should synchronise. The URL is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get back to the default setting of one minute.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have setup your mac to use the &lsquo;Graphite&rsquo; appearance instead of the default &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; theme, Omnifocus will have black and white icons in the toolbar instead of the modern coloured icons. If you prefer this to be different, you can use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to force the use of coloured buttons or <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get the black and white icons in the toolbar. As usual, with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> you&rsquo;ll go back to the default setting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This option was contributed by Colter in the comments of this post. When in Forecast view, you can drag a task to another date in the calendar to change its due date. You can change the defer date instead by holding the ‚åò key. If you would like to change the defer date by default, you can use the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re using folders, OmniFocus will show the complete path in the project selection drop-down list using a colon as the hierarchy separation character, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personal : Finance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can configure the character used to separate the project hierarchy with the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-setting?OFMNamedObjectHierarchicalNameSeparator=%20:%20<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->%20<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the code for a space).</p>
<p>Please leave a comment if you know of any other configuration option for Omnifocus 2; I will keep this post up-to-date.</p>

			 <p>In preparation for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iCloud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> launch in autumn, I have been thinking about its impact on my use of Apple services. Our family uses several <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iDevices<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the better syncing options offered by iCloud will be very welcome. However, I have some concerns about purchasing and synching.</p>
<p>At this moment I use two different accounts to access Apple&rsquo;s services: I have a regular Apple ID which I use for purchasing Apps and home sharing media, and I also have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MobileMe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account for synching data between my Macbook and the iPhone. The MobileMe account is used just by me, while all iDevices share the same Apple ID for the obvious reason that I don&rsquo;t want to purchase apps twice. Furthermore, by using two separate accounts we are able to access all iTunes libraries from the AppleTV, without being obliged to synchronize calendars as well, as those are being synched using another account. In short: the Apple ID identifies the family/home, while MobileMe is used to identify a person.</p>
<p>When Apple activates iCloud, my Apple ID will also become the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->token<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for synching information, which is a problem for me. I would like to continue using the Apple ID to make purchases for the whole family and stream media between the devices of our family, while on the other hand each member needs a personal ID for synching calendars, mail accounts and other personal data. When Apple closes MobileMe I will be forced to sync my calendar through iCloud, but my wife has no interest at all in my appointments (and vice versa).</p>
<p>As far as I have been able to find out, iCloud will not offer such granularity. I assume that my situation is quite common and that many families with several devices will face the same issue. Does anybody know a solution for this problem, or do we simply have to wait for the final version of iCloud and hope that Apple has already a solution?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Google has released a new security measure to help you protect your ever increasing amount of data stored on their servers. This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2-step authentication<!-- raw HTML omitted --> means that when you log in to your Google account with your username and password, you will receive a code by SMS message. Only after entering this code you will be able to get to your data.</p>
<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data on Google&rsquo;s servers (I hardly ever use Gmail or Google Docs, mainly just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Reader<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) I thought that it was a good idea to activate this service &ndash; better safe than sorry, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I went ahead and activated the service. The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup verification codes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky &lsquo;finder&rsquo; the possibility to get into your Google account <!-- raw HTML omitted -->without<!-- raw HTML omitted --> needing the SMS confirmation.</p>
<p>I immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that &ndash;with the current roaming rates in Europe&ndash; they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Satisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for iPhone, FlipBook, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for iPad, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Earth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.</p>
<p>I know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google&rsquo;s servers. To me it makes no sense that &ndash;even though one application increased its security&ndash; the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.</p>
<p>I finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can&rsquo;t use Google anymore as my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenID provider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web &ndash;those that require registration&ndash; I want to comment on. Too much of a hassle to be functional&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After some weeks of work &ndash;though I only spend 1-2 hours every week on this project&ndash; I am re-releasing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->brain tags<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have lost the count of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->version numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of this blog, but is should probably the 6th or 7th overhaul. I am very excited about it, as I see it as a fresh start with some important changes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After many, many years, I have exported all data from my old <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installation, and installed a fresh copy of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Melody<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on a fresh new account. For those who are not familiar with those two applications, Melody is a fork Movable Type version 4.</p>
<p>I choose to move to Melody for several reasons. First of all, I was not completely happy with the latest versions of Movable Type, which added a lot of unneeded bloat, such as the possibility to create <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sites<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In fact, Movable Type obliges you to first create a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be able to create a weblog. But the biggest reason is the fact that support for Movable Type is decreasing, now that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->owner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is focussed on advertising, and development on Movable Type takes place in Japan.</p>
<p>Melody was created by two former employees of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash;one of them was product manager for Movable Type&ndash; and a very active community member. They have already been able to solve a lot of the main issues in Movable Type in Melody, and I simply trust more in them than in the current developers of Movable Type.</p>
<p>A final note on the change: while both Melody and Movable Type can handle multiple blogs and I traditionally have managed all my blogs from a single installation, I am now separating them again. This way I can make my customizations without making my other blogs more complex. It also gives me a way to test out things.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Melody comes with a very nice minimalistic theme as the default theme, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DePo Clean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I decided to keep it. For the moment I haven&rsquo;t personalized the templates, though I did fix some minor bugs in the theme. Once I figure out how to make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->diff<!-- raw HTML omitted --> files, I will probably submit the patches to the Melody developers.</p>
<p>I do have a list of wishes and desires for the theme, so don&rsquo;t be surprised when things change over time.</p>

<p>Even though the combined Akismet and Typepad spam filters are very effective, I still had to deal with several comments in the moderation queue every week. Since nowadays there are plenty of other ways to express your opinion, I have disabled the comments function. If you want to share your opinion, feel free to send me a [tweet]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->6<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When importing the old entries, I left out all decorational images. In the last years, I always accompanied each post with an image to make the post more attractive. Those images are now gone, you will only find images which help making my point. I want the focus to be on my words, and will also try to write longer, more thoughtful posts from now on.</p>
<p>I am very excited about this new start. What do you think?</p>

			 <p>The mobile revolution is shaking up the software market. Old paradigms (bigger is better) disappear and new ones are created.</p>
<p>One area where these changes are specifically noticeable is the relation between applications and the file system.</p>
<p>Most computing environments are in what I call the second generation, where the file system is the dominant part of this relation. The file is the centre of our activities. To start working we open a file and the associated application is automatically launched. We only start application directly when we want to create a new file.</p>
<p>This has not always been like this: in the past (first generation) the applications were the core, where applications gave access to data on the mainframe or in databases. There are some situations where we work in applications without having any idea of the underlying file- or database structure. E-mail is one of the uses of this system.</p>
<p>Like I said, the mobile revolution is changing this again. Mobile operating systems as iOS, Symbian and Android give very limited access to the file system and force us back to the mainframe era. Even the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> operating systems don&rsquo;t give you direct access to the file system anymore, but rather a virtual system mounted on top of the real file system.</p>
<p>It looks like file system abstraction is the future, but I don&rsquo;t think that applications will be the centre of our universe. The operating system of the future won&rsquo;t be centred on files or applications, but will use processes and tasks as the leading parameter.</p>
<p>In the operating system of the future, you will be able to say that you want to write, and a simple text editor will open. The moment you access more advanced editing functions, the application will automatically switch to another editing engine. Of course, you text is automatically saved and can be used in many ways.</p>
<p>In the future, operating systems will actually help you being productive. Trust me.</p>

			 <p>A recent trend in the blogosphere has been to add <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweets as comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on posts. I understand where this comes from, as in general commenting on blog posts has decreased in favour of twittering. By adding all tweets mentioning your blog posts, your posts look more alive and will probably attract more readers.</p>
<p>Whenever I think about features for my blogs, I always ask myself what the value is for my readers. In the case of tweets as comments, I look for the answer based on my own experiences. It happens frequently that I find an interesting post with let&rsquo;s say 20 comments. When I finished reading this, otherwise interesting, blog post and get ready for participating in the conversation, I find out that there actually are only two real comments, followed by a tweet of the author and 17 retweets adding absolutely nothing to the post or the conversation. Immediately my motivation to participate in the conversation is gone and I quickly move on to the next blog.</p>
<p>Although in theory tweets are comments about your posts (or at least mentioning the post), they hardly ever contribute to the discussion. If you absolutely want to display the tweets on your blog post, go ahead, but don&rsquo;t mix them with the comments. If in the example above the tweets would have been separated from the comments and the blogs metadata would have shown me that the post has 2 comments and 18 tweets, I would not be so disappointed and probably would have left a comment as well.</p>

<p>When I have time I will try to fix it or I will simply remove the fancy AJAX part. I&rsquo;ll keep you informed.</p>

			 <p>One of the most interesting parts for web site owners are the access statistics, and Google Analytics offers one of the most complete statistics solutions, which I use on a weekly basis for my most successful blog <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Besides being a typical blog with pages, I offer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->calendars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for downloading, and of course I also want to track those downloads. When two years ago I started with the downloads I search Google&rsquo;s help files for a solution to track them, and found a small javascript sniplet that when a visitor clicks on a download link registers the download as a pageview. This trick allowed me to analyse the downloads.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this trick is that it inflates the pageviews, and I never have been completely satisfied about this solution. You can imagine my happiness when last week I discovered the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Tracking<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feature, designed specifically to track downloads, videoplays, etc.</p>
<p>I quickly changed my code to use a javascript sniplet like the following:</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last weekend I attended the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evento Blog Espa√±a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> conference in Seville, and one of the more attractive talks on the schedule was called 2.0 services and technology in business by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Luis Su√°rez<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, technology evangelist at IBM.</p>
<p>Luis explained how he stopped using e-mail completely and replaced the functionality by a variety of web 2.0 tools, each specialized for a specific task. When he started talking, I remembered how Tim Ferriss also &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; e-mail in his book.</p>
<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The 4-Hour Workweek<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Tim explains how he only reads his e-mail a few times per day while an autoresponder tells the senders to use the phone instead for more urgent messages. I have read it several times, but I still can&rsquo;t see where the productivity increase comes from. I&rsquo;d rather check my e-mail twice a day to reduce phone calls. In my opinion, phone calls are a bigger time waster that e-mail. When someone phones you, that person decides for you that the issue he is phoning about is at that moment more important than all other issues you are working on. A phone call is almost always an interruption in your workflow, while e-mail is part of the workflow. Of course, there are times when a phone call is justified, for example when a customer is having technical problems that stopped his business. The idea is to use the right tool for the job, and in the past years I have spend quite some time explaining that the phone usually is not the right tool and that e-mail or IM for more time-dependant questions are more adequate.</p>
<p>Using the right tool for the job is exactly why Luis Su√°rez stopped using e-mail and changed it for instant messaging, wikis, blogs, rss, bookmark services, quickr, etc. In principle I agree with Luis that e-mail is not always the best tool to use, but at this moment there is a scattering problem when using web 2.0 tools. I already noticed this when I try to convince people to stop phoning me and use IM instead. There is a myriad of IM tools and protocols available, and to be able to communicate with all my customers I need ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Messenger, Skype and GTalk. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of them!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I am a tech savvy guy, so I can handle this (all accounts are nicely accessible from one client: Digsby), but this surely is no option for many other people, who already find it very difficult to install one IM client.</p>
<p>Now imagine the same thing happening with all other functions of e-mail. To collaborate on a document there are dozens of services available. Of course I will choose one of them, but will me customer also use that? Of course not, they use Google Docs instead of a wiki. And as I cooperate with more people, my shared work will be shattered across the internet. I remember a customer send me a link to an interesting article, but where is it? I need to maintain a database to know that this particular customer uses Delicious to share bookmarks.</p>
<p>You can say a lot about e-mail. It is not the perfect tool for collaboration or status reporting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it is a standard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Everybody has e-mail, and everybody knows how to use it. And if you work together with many customers, using web 2.0 solutions will not be an option in the majority of cases, until there will be a common protocol or tool such as Digsby for IM that allows people using different services for a functionality to cooperate.</p>

			 <p>Today I launched the new design for Brain Tags. For a while I have been using the default theme provided by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but after updating the blogging engine to version 4.2 I decided to make some changes to make fully use of the new features offered by this version.</p>
<p>The theme I used is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mid-Century<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and is a good example of the possibilities of the latest version of Movable Type Pro. To improve speed and stability, I used a static publishing model, while using cached modules for some of the sidebar widgets. That way I can easily update for example my Latest Comments widget without having to rebuild all individual archive files.</p>
<p>With this redesign I also stopped using Google Adsense, as the income generated was simply too low to justify its use.</p>
<p>In the coming days I will probably be making some little adjustments to adapt the new design to my tastes and needs.</p>

			 <p>That is the question I have been asking myself a lot this year. In the past I always had a clear answer to this question, but lately I struggle with the aim of this site, which is why it has been very silent over here.</p>
<p>The first incarnation of Brain Tags was simply to inform my friends abroad about what was going on in my life, which was a very novel idea back in 1997.
The second incarnation of Brain Tags in 2001 still had the same aim, but intense due to my emigration to Spain.</p>
<p>After some years the content started shifting to include web design and other technology topics. I got settled in Spain, and my daily life was not so interesting anymore‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And now that blogging has become very mainstream (my wifes mobile phone comes with a blogging client installed!) and there are a thousand blogs writing essentially the same, I wonder what the place of Brain Tags is.</p>
<p>For a while I thought about closing Brain Tags, but then I decided that I do have a very clear and sometimes unique opinion about many subjects. So I do want to continue writing here, but probably in a different format. I think that shorter articles with some original thinking (less copying/forwarding stuff from others) will be the way to go. I will also incorporate some other things such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> steams etc. in the blog design.</p>
<p>Be prepared for changes, Brain Tags is alive!</p>

			 <p>First there where blogs, then came the e-books and now there are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interactive Learning Environments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (ILE). Building an ILE is a novel way of sharing your knowledge. For the last two months I have been following the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Teaching Sells<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†course, and I am very enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p>The course is divided into five parts: Instructional design, marketing, creating multi-media content, business models and building membership sites. The more technical parts are not that interesting for me (just some links to the software used is enough for me), but the other three courses are well worth the money. Furthermore, the forums already brought some very good contacts, and I might be setting up some joint-ventures to start building membership sites.</p>
<p>My first ILE project will probably be a Spanish productivity course (what else?), on which I will start working in a few months (of course I am already doing some brainstorming now‚Ä¶)</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s continue our trip through the history of Brain Tags at 1998, my second year of blogging.</p>
<p>I celebrated my birthday party in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->De Jeugdhof<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and after cleaning the floor we forgot to close the fire hose. The next morning when we came back to finish cleaning we encountered a swimming pool instead of our cleaned floor. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oops<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I also went to Africa and visited the very interesting country of Lesotho. Of course, still being a rookie blogger I only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slightly mentioned<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this instead of writing a post with high Google juice. Missed change indeed.</p>
<p>I also had the worst skin problems I remember and had to stay home for several days because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my face was severely infected<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still don&rsquo;t know what caused it (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->allergy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?, stress?), but fortunately it didn&rsquo;t return after 1998.</p>
<p>Then there were of course some stories about Jong Nederland, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kaderschouw<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Night of 16+<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, planning the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EuroContact<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the famous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->volleyball tournament<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Utrecht district.</p>

			 <p>As I have been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogging for 10 years<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now, I thought it would be a nice idea to look back at almost 1000 posts on my sites. Today an overview of the year it all started: 1997.</p>
<p>Though I already had a personal web page for some years, I didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time on it. My main interests these days were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jong Nederland<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In November I had a great weekend with all JN volunteers on a national level, and in December I joined a Fimcap meeting in Rome.

			 <p>Two years ago, reflections were cool and something new. Reflections gave your web site or your application a crisp look.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even the big operating systems and television stations have reflections and thus reflections as a design element are outdated. I am surprised, even irritated, by the big number of startups still using reflections in their logo or their screendumps only to look &lsquo;cool&rsquo;.</p>

			 <p>I could simply write here that I am too busy to write on Brain Tags, but I guess it is more interesting for you to read what I am doing currently. So this is a short list of my most interesting current projects:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a project on which I have been working for a long time (not always as active as now) and which should have been finished a long time ago. I am now finishing off the new design, after which we can finally show the world the work we have been doing. Working on a graphical design is quite an adventure for a technical person like me. I can easily tell whether I like a design or not, but to make one yourself is a whole different thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hopping along with the Fimcap redesign, I am also reworking the site where I station my side-business. Both sites are built on eZ Publish, so I use the experiences on ons site to advance on another. I am also working to leverage some of the karma I got with blogging to new profitable projects under the Brytenet umbrella. You will read more about that when these plans have crystallized a little bit more. Anyway, currently the Brytenet site is off-line while I restructure the content, but before next week I hope to be open for business again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is still one room in our house where we didn&rsquo;t do anything since we moved in, the room where our visitors sleep. Those who have visited us can confirm that the beds in that room have had their time. So we are going to use our holiday in November to get rid of the current furniture and paint the room. In the mean time we are already looking for two new beds and a wardrobe to provide our guests with better rest and ourselves with more storage room.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally I started an on-line course about making on-line courses (?) called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Teaching Sells<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will probably help me getting all that information I have been absorbing over the past years out of my head and into my wallet. I am sure some very interesting new projects will arise from that course.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The blogs are still there, and will stay, though I am considering stopping to write on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>When I started using the default templates coming with Movable Type 4, I missed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recent Comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget. Below I explain how you can add create this widget and ass it to your sidebar in true MT4 style.</p>
<p>In the Movable Type administrative interface, go to Design &gt; Templates &gt; Template Modules and open either the ‚ÄòSidebar - 2 Column Layout‚Äô or the ‚ÄòSidebar - 3 Column Layout‚Äô template module, depending on which one you are using. Scroll down until you find a line with `` and paste the following code just above that line (you can of course also choose another position for the recent comments widget):</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-archives widget&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&ldquo;widget-header&rdquo;&gt;Recent Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-content&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&ldquo;widget-list&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;li class=&ldquo;widget-list-item&rdquo;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&gt; on &lt;a&lt;br /&gt;href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now in any template where you want to show the recent comments (e.g. the main index template or the individual archive template) you add the following line: ``
Rebuild your weblog, and it should show you the five latest comments in the sidebar, just as you can see on this blog.</p>

			 <p>Widgets are the fastest and easiest way to configure your sidebar. Just open up the widget administrator and drag and drop widgets on the sidebar. A great feature for novice bloggers, who don&rsquo;t have the technical knowledge to tweak sidebar templates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the default Movable Type templates don&rsquo;t use widgets, which means that to enable widgets on your site you will have to tweak the sidebar template‚Ä¶ ouch!</p>
<p>I know, the default sidebar template offers a far more advanced features than the widget engine can offer, with variables and MTIf constructions. The default sidebar template is a lot cooler without widgets, but also very hard to tweak.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the default sidebar template should include a check on the number of widgets configured. If no widgets have been configured, it should show the fancy sidebar, but as soon as I configure widgets, it should hide the normal sidebar and show the widgets. This is also what many templates in WordPress do and gives you the both of two sides: a fancy sidebar for starters which is easily adaptable by weblog owners.</p>

			 <p>As of today, Brain Tags is not a stand alone blog anymore, but uses my central Movable Type installation at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ai-No<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Hopefully you haven&rsquo;t noticed anything of the changes, as I have been able to limit the downtime to only two minutes (the time necessary to delete an account from the web server and configure an add-on domain.</p>
<p>As Ai-No has its own blog which I will use for meta-blogging, there will obviously be less meta-blogging going on over here. So this blog will concentrate more on technology, web development and my life in Spain.

All TinyURLs I receive have a six character identifier, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3bso2z<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A little calculation (six positions with 36 options per position) gives me 2.238.976.116 unique identifiers. More than two billion, that sounds already better. And if they run out of Ids, they can simply use seven or eight characters, which I still consider tiny. Eight positions give 2.984.555.162.628 (2 trillion!) unique identifiers!</p>
<p>It is clear: TinyURL is here to stay.</p>

			 <p>Now that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type 4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been released and leaped ahead of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the old discussion of static publishing versus dynamic publishing shows up again. Movable Type by default uses static publishing (it generates static HTML files with are served to the visitor) while WordPress uses dynamic publishing (all content is served directly from the database). What method is better?</p>
<p>As usual, the answer is: it depends‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Static publishing requires less server resources per visit, but it takes longer before updates (entries, comments and template changes) are visible. With dynamical publishing, your changes are immediately visible to your visitors, but you&rsquo;ll need more power to serve those pages.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For most bloggers it won&rsquo;t make any difference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as they hardly tweak their templates and receive few comments and visitors. However, if you like tweaking your templates, you might want to go dynamic, and popular blogs are better off going static.</p>
<p>But wait, I can hear you think: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there are some very popular blogs using WordPress‚Ä¶<!-- raw HTML omitted --> That&rsquo;s right, and without exception they use some kind of caching method to lower the server stress. On the other side, Movable Type can also run in dynamic mode (which is what I use for this blog), and you can specify for each template whether it should be served statically or dynamically, allowing you to optimize your site&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: for low-traffic sites, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you publish static or dynamic. If you have many visitors you probable want to use static or hybrid publishing.</p>

			 <p>The productivity guru of the moment, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim Ferriss<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, writes in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how he was able to reduce the amount of e-mail received by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->setting up an autoresponder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to tell that he only reads his e-mail once a day and that it is better to phone him for urgent matters.</p>
<p>I believe him, when he tells that this technique has reduced his e-mail load significantly. But what he doesn&rsquo;t tell is what happened to the number of telephone conversations he received. In my case, I notice a clear increase in telephone calls when I am very busy and cannot answer e-mails within the usual 12 hours. And guess what, when I am very busy, the last thing I am waiting for are telephone calls! When somebody phones me, that person decides what I will be doing for the next two minutes and when I will give attention to him (now!), while with e-mail I am the one deciding who should get my attention and when.</p>
<p>Tim&rsquo;s trick only works because his workload is very low. When you&rsquo;re workload is higher and you need to spend more time in the zone, it makes more sense to change your voice mail message to tell people that you can only be reached by phone during one hour a day and that they get faster response when they send their inquiry by e-mail.</p>

			 <p>For quite some time I have been happily using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coComment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For those who don&rsquo;t know this service: coComment basically keeps track of the comments you leave on web sites. If you&rsquo;re like me, reading and commenting on many sites, it can be difficult to track the replies to your comments. coComment captures your comment and tracks the conversations started by those comments on a single page instead of having to revisit all sites you&rsquo;ve commented on.</p>
<p>Yesterday coComment released a new version, bringing more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->social<!-- raw HTML omitted --> features. By doing that, they threw out the real value of their service: tracking conversations. The new page reserves 75% of screen real estate for groups, friends, favourites and neighbours, leaving just enough space for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only five conversations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Furthermore, all my conversations have been marked as unread, and I could not find an option to mark them all as read. This is not an upgrade, this is a downgrade!</p>

			 <p>Whenever I had an idea for a blog post, I used to create a new entry on that particular blog, jot down my idea, and save the post as a draft. As soon as I had more time, I checked the list with draft posts, chose a draft, and finished the post.</p>
<p>What had worked perfectly for a long time, lately became a burden. The problem is that over the time I have collected a great number of interesting themes to write about, resulting in a big amount of drafts. Some of those drafts only contain an URL, while other are more elaborated. In short, it became too difficult to find out quickly what was what.</p>
<p>So now I have changed my blogging workflow. I transferred all my ideas to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Notebook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where they are nicely ordered per blog. On that page I can see all ideas with their actual content at a single page. One glance on my Notebook, and I can quickly decide what to write. Furthermore, with the Google Notebook Firefox extension I am able to select a text on a random web page and copy it together with the address of the page to my Notebook.</p>
<p>From now on, drafts in my blogging software are actually pieces I already have started to write, which usually are only a few. This set-up keeps things clear, and speeds up my blogging workflow.</p>

<p>The traditional source of music was the radio, but when travelling long distances in several countries, you&rsquo;ll loose your station every two hours. The past years we brought some CDs with us, but CDs are bulky and we can only take a few of them.</p>

			 <p>Last week <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> released the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta for Movable Type version 4<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Until last weekend I didn&rsquo;t have the time to have a look at it, but Sunday I downloaded the files and copied them to my server.</p>
<p>Of course things went wrong, as was to be expected with a beta release. I know that you never should install beta releases on a production environment, but I took the risk anyway as this weblog is partly a playing ground. I am a long-time Movable Type user, and suspect that my database is full of legacy data of old settings and plugins.</p>
<p>After copying the files, I went to the new MT Dashboard, and found out that all images had been scrambled. I suspected that my FTP application accidentally had uploaded them in ASCII mode, so copied them again in binary mode, without result. I checked the files I had downloaded from Six Apart, and yes, they were scrambled as well. So I downloaded the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tar.gz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file instead of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zip<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, uploaded the images again, and the images came up correctly.</p>
<p>The second problem I encountered was more serious. The dashboard showed up OK, but whenever I tried to access one of the blogs, I got an error message:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->invalid permissions for author 1 at lib/MT/Author.pm line 337<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This one took a little bit more to solve, but at the end I found out that newly created users don&rsquo;t have this problem. After comparing all settings in the database between my old users and the new user, I found the culprit: In the table &lsquo;mt_permission&rsquo; I found duplicate record for my user ID with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->permision_blog_id = 0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After removing the duplicate records, the error did not appear any more.</p>
<p>Now I am able to get into my blogs, and as you see, write new items. However, as soon as I publish a new entry I get another error message: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fallback Is Required At Lib/mt/util.pm Line 1331<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I haven&rsquo;t solved this error yet, but found out that I can simply rebuild my site to make the entry appear.</p>
<p>As you can see, I also changed the design of the site. I was getting fed up with the previous design, and at the same time wanted to see what new template features came with MT4, so I reset the templates to the new minimalist theme. The coming days I will be studying and tweaking this design to my own tastes, so things might change a little bit.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed already is that the default templates do not use the widget manager, basically because the new sidebar template module offers filtering by template type, giving the possibility to show a different sidebar on different types of pages.</p>
<p>Other things they copied from WordPress are Pages and a file manager (with tagging!!!).</p>
<p>There are still some other things to be fixed, such as activating trackbacks. In the blog&rsquo;s configuration I see that this has been deactivated on a system level, which is not the case. So far I like MT4 a lot. It is fast, pleasant looking and I am happy with new features such as the file manager, entry auto-save and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interactive template errors<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Though my spamfilters, SpamLookup in combination with Akismet, catch really a lot of comment- and trackback spam on this blog, there is still too much spam slipping through. Since I don&rsquo;t have the time to check my site to see whether comment spam has been published, I have changed my configuration to automatically moderate comments and trackbacks on entries older than twee weeks on which no comment has been posted in the previous week.</p>
<p>This allows me to batch-process the moderation queue, while still making sure that comments on active threads still show up immediately.</p>

			 <p>My latest weblog <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a big success, with more and more readers every day.</p>
<p>Every week a few other weblogs link to articles from El Canasto and therefore I expected my PageRank to increase, but to my big surprise Google decided to lower the PageRank for El Canasto last week. It went from five down to four, and I have no idea why.</p>
<p>Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t care about it, but in this case El Canasto was about to enter in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Top 500<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Spanish weblogs, and I expected an increase of visitors when arriving to that point, but the PageRank is one of the factors used to calculate popularity. The decrease in PageRank set me back to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->position 650<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

			 <p>In order for a weblog to be successful, an author needs to write with personality. A weblog needs its own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voice<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And I have to be honest and admit that Brain Tags was missing a voice lately. I did post regulary, but most of the content was picked elsewhere and republished here.</p>
<p>But the voice is back! Of course I will still occasionally post a nice video, but will also start writing again about technology, travelling and my life in general. As a true <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> adept, I added this commitment to my list of responsibilities (20.000 feet), and started thinking about some projects to undertake to blow new life in this site.</p>
<p>In November I will celebrate the 10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> anniversary of my weblog, and will plan some extra activities here for all people who have followed me throughout the years.
Stay tuned!</p>

			 <p>I am on the road again. Today I am traveling from Barcelona to Cyprus, spending over ten hours in airplanes and airports. No distractions, just me, so I could get a lot of job done. I carry a laptop computer, and already wrote some documents, I checked my e-mail and read all interesting news in Google Reader. I am in the ‚Äòflow‚Äô, but will soon have to stop working. My laptop is running out of batteries, and I still have about half the trip to go. I searched in every corner of the airport, but haven&rsquo;t found a single power outlet!</p>
<p>Many travellers nowadays carry laptop computers and other electronic devices, and most of those devices need electricity. Batteries only serve for some hours, so power outlets in airports would be useful to many travellers. I can&rsquo;t imagine the number of productive hours lost each year in Milano alone! Please airports, give us power outlets.</p>

			 <p>A little bit more than one month ago, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I started a new weblog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> called &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; in which I write about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and personal productivity.</p>
<p>Until now I have written 28 posts meaning that I have been able to keep up with my initial schedule of at least one post every two days. I found it easy to find new material, and usually have about 10 posts in he pipeline.</p>
<p>The people have received the new blog very well. I have received 30 comments/trackbacks. Quite some bloggers have found my blog and have reposted or linked to my articles. The most popular post is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my translation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Seah&rsquo;s compact calendar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for 2007 with 2850 unique views. At this moment I am receiving about 200-400 visitors per day.</p>
<p>So far it has been a very positive experience for me. Even though it costs me a little bit more time to write in Spanish, I enjoy using this language and already learned some more. Of course I tell my visitors that I am not a native speaker, and hope they are willing to forgive my errors.</p>

			 <p>I just wanted to look up some information, and I remembered having read about it in a webfeed in Google Reader. Without thinking I opened up Google Reader, ready to type in my query, but there was no search box!</p>
<p>How is it possible that the world&rsquo;s biggest search company releases a product suited for search without adding a search function??? Google, you are missing a huge opportunity here.</p>

			 <p>Today I published the first entry on a new weblog: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>El Canasto is my first blog in Spanish and has been created for two reasons. The first reason is that I have found very little material in Spanish about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lifehacks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the topics I like to read about. There is clearly something missing in the Spanish weblog spectrum. The second reason is that I really want to improve my Spanish language skills, but don&rsquo;t have the discipline to sit down and study. However, writing about stuff I like might give me the drive to learn more.</p>
<p>To set up El Canasto I used WordPress and the minimalistic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cutline<!-- raw HTML omitted --> theme. I spent some days making sure every word in the template has been translated correctly into Spanish, and have many plans more for optimizing the look &amp; feel of this new site. But for the moment, it is more important to get rolling, so I published a first little entry. My plan is to maintain a higher posting frequency than on this blog or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as I have much material and a lot of ideas for this blog.</p>
<p>For now I would like all my readers to have a look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Pareto principle was named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of income in Italy was received by 20% of the Italian population, but the same principle can be found in many other situations.</p>
<p>In most businesses, 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales. And technical departments know that 80% of the problems are caused by only 20% of the clients. This is very interesting information for managers, who can use these numbers to steer their sales and support departments.</p>
<p>But how can we correlate the Pareto numbers for these two departments? Are the 20% that purchase the most the same customers that use most of your organization&rsquo;s resources? Well, experience tells us that this is not the case: there usually are customers buying for huge amounts without ever needing the support department. The two Pareto principle are not correlated, so if we only look at the small group of customers responsible for 80% of the sales, you will find once again that 20% of that group is using 80% of the resources.</p>
<p>As there is no correlation, I can easily divide my customers into four distinct groups:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I put those four groups in a specific order. The first group is worth the most, as they bring in a lot of money at low costs and the fourth group is the most difficult group.</p>
<p>So should you just drop the customers in the fourth group? Of course not, as we are talking about a principle and not a fixed categorization. If you drop group four, and look again at the numbers, you will see that once again 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales and 80% of the resources are used by only 20% of the clients. Customers who were in to top 20% before, not rank lower simple because you have less customers. If I have 100 clients, there are 20 clients in the top 20%, but if I drop 50 of them, the top 20% will be formed by only 10 customers. Of course, if you have to drop customers, because you haven&rsquo;t got enough resources, make sure you drop clients from the fourth group, as the clients in the other three groups are worth more.</p>

			 <p>A while ago I tried out the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Reader<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and haven&rsquo;t looked back at my old <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RSSBandit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ever after. It ran very smoothly since the start, and I just love the &lsquo;River of News&rsquo; view.</p>
<p>But lately the experience has decreased. The last few days Google News feels slow, taking about 2-3 seconds to go from one article to the next one when I press the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->J<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key, which was also noticed by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Scoble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I also noticed that sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t load all my unread items as it did before; after reading about fifty articles, I reach the bottom, while there are still many unread items waiting for me to be read. This is not a big issue, as I can simply press the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to refresh.
The last days I noticed another glitch: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zombie articles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Google Reader tells me &lsquo;Your reading list has no unread items&rsquo;, while at the same time it shows that I have two unread articles from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tech.memeorandum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For me, this is the most irritating glitch, as I have to leave my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->River of News<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to open the specific feed, change my setting to show all articles and go down the list to find the zombie.</p>
<p>Google Reader still is my preferred reader, and I hope they will solve these glitches soon.</p>

			 <p>Sometime, thing that have been in place for many years get in the way. In such cases, it is better to get rid of them.</p>
<p>Today, I said goodbye to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->music jukebox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the place where for the past two years you could find tasty music. In this age of streaming music and video, there is no need any more to share MP3 files. Sites like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last.fm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandora<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are of greater help for discovering new music you like.</p>
<p>I also removed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jeroensangers.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site. Until now, that page showed an ugly photo of me (is it even possible to have a pretty photo at all?) and some links to my various sites. I am going to rethink the purpose of that site, which will probably contain more dynamic content. Until then, the site is in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stealth mode<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Just like most other weblogs, this site has its ups and downs, and you might have noticed that it has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->down<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lately. I am quite busy at the moment, working parallel at several projects.</p>
<p>The company I work for is preparing for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SIMO<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trade show in Madrid, where we will present the new versions of our products. Though I won&rsquo;t be present at the show (my responsibilities lie outside Spain) I do have a lot of extra work concerning translating and testing the new software.</p>
<p>Then I am working on the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> web site. This weekend we are going to finish the forum functionality and start working on the design. We already did some brainstorming and I am happy that we are all more or less on the same line. Once the design is finished we will start using the first parts of the new site, and gradually transfer more functionality.</p>
<p>Once in a while I also work a little bit on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BryteNet hosting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Little by little the customers are coming in, but as everything is running smoothly and automated, I don&rsquo;t have much work on it.</p>
<p>And finally there is the blogging thing. I am planning on taking it more seriously, using Brain Tags for playing around, and doing the real blogging at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I am rethinking my work flow to crank up the posting frequency &ndash;now once a week&ndash; and have a more diverse range of articles. Furthermore I am working on a new weblog in Spanish about <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->GTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>You see, I have plenty of work, so I better stop writing and get something done!</p>

			 <p>Everybody who knows me a little bit will admit it: I am a lazy person. Because I am so lazy I work in the IT industry, dreaming about automating all those boring tasks. Of course, automating tasks is hard work, but I don&rsquo;t want to think about that.</p>
<p>One of the problems I wanted to automate for a very long time is making backups of my PC. I know that it is very important to backup my files, and usually after tweaking my backup system I backup every X days. But after a while I loose interest, and days become weeks, and weeks become months,‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Media choice is another problem with backups, as the amount of data I have is growing exponentially. Back in the MS-DOS days, all important data fitted on e few floppy disks. As I started my studies and got involved in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jong Nederland<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I produced more documents and changed to ZIP disks for my backup. When I started ripping MP3 files, I was forced to change to CD&rsquo;s and DVD&rsquo;s. And now that I am creating my own video&rsquo;s I need even more than that. I thought about buying a USB hard disk, but the thought of spending a lot of money for a medium that will be outdated within two years kept me from going to the store.</p>
<p>And then I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Carbonite Online Backup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Carbonite is a little application that will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->automatically<!-- raw HTML omitted --> backup my files to a server on the internet, without any user interaction. The best part of Carbonite is its price: $5 per month for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unlimited<!-- raw HTML omitted --> storage!!! So for only $5 per month I can sit back and relax, knowing that my files are safe, and I won&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of space in the future.</p>
<p>I quickly downloaded and installed the demo version (15 days free), which promptly began to upload data. Now there was a little problem, as our broadband connection is ADSL, and the A stands for Asynchronous meaning that you can download at high speeds, but have less bandwidth available for uploading. It took me two days to get all my files to the Carbonite server.</p>
<p>When checking what files were present on the Carbonite server, I noticed that there was a lot of crap. In the installation procedure, I had selected that I wanted to backup <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Documents<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which Carbonite had interpreted as being the whole <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Documents and settings<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder, including cached files, etc. I tweaked the settings a little bit, and was able to reduce the backed up volume by one third. I also added some other files such as my ActiveWords database and my Trillian preferences (both installed under <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Program Files<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the whole system up and running for some weeks now, and am very happy with it. My backups are always up-to-date and I don&rsquo;t have to think about copying files anymore.</p>
<p>The only problem I have found is my mailbox. As I typically have e-mail open during the whole day, the inbox file changes continuously. Besides that, the file is rather big, taking a while to upload. The result is that this particular file is hardly ever backed up. I am still looking for a solution, possibly using another tool to create a local copy and adding this copy to Carbonite.</p>
<p>In short: Carbonite is a very good product giving great value for its money.</p>

			 <p>For me the holiday period is not only a period for relaxing, but also a period of reflection. I never make any <!-- raw HTML omitted -->January 1st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> changes to my habits, but usually do so in August or September.</p>
<p>For a while I have been thinking about doing more sports, as most days my physical exercise is limited to the daily walk to the garage to pick up the car. We do occasionally walk in the mountains, but that&rsquo;s not enough. I have been thinking about it for a long time but never found the activity that suited me. My working hours make it difficult to commit to team sports and I don&rsquo;t like the gym as I prefer something in the open air.</p>
<p>This summer it finally occurred me: inline skating could me my thing. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed ice skating in the Netherlands, and like the freedom of making little tours around my hometown. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. Right after coming home I bought myself some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rollerblades<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the Geo II model, and downloaded some braking instructions as I knew that I&rsquo;d had to learn different breaking techniques that I used on ice.</p>
<p>This week I went out skating two times on an empty parking lot. The coming weeks I will go back there to practice my breaking skills before I hit the streets. And you know what the best thing is? I already feel good about myself!</p>

			 <p>One more week to go until the start of our holidays. Yes, we go when everybody else already forgot about their holidays.</p>
<p>Our plans are simple: we are going to spend one week in the Netherlands, and two weeks in Andalusia. We&rsquo;ve tried to visit my family before, but the flights were simply too expensive in the high season. So we decided to use part of our holidays to visit my family and our friends. As we have plenty of time, we will go up by car, saving a few bucks along the way.</p>
<p>After that we plan to spend some days at home to pick up our tent, and drive further down to Andalusia. In the almost five years that I live here, I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of Spain besides Catalonia. Of course there is plenty to see over here, but I feel a little bit ashamed of my lack of knowledge about the other parts of this country. The two weeks we will be spend in the south will be a little start in getting to know more of Spain.</p>

<p>I can, however, update your AdSense login to a non-Gmail address if you prefer. You can simply reply to this email, providing the desired email address in the body of your response, and I&rsquo;ll take care of your request as soon as I&rsquo;m able.</p>

<p>WTF?! Google does not have the possibility to merge accounts???? If I sign up with Yahoo! I can use that e-mail account for AdWords, but I can&rsquo;t use a GMail account?

<p>Yes, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->43 Folders podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is my favourite <!-- raw HTML omitted -->podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are a few reasons why I consider it my favourite. Besides the obvious reasons such as &ldquo;Merlin Mann is a geek like me&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am obsessed with productivity tools&rdquo; there is another difference between the 43 Folders podcast and 99% of all the other podcasts out there.</p>
<p>Most people listen to podcasts during their daily commute. Modern society forces people to spend a ridiculous amount of time travelling, and there are very few things you can do while driving a car. Most commuters listen to music or the radio, but that is a very unproductive activity. If you want to spend your car-time productively, you only have two options: audio-based learning and listening to podcasts. Long commutes are the perfect place for listening podcast, and most podcasters target their show to this group. The result is that most podcasts are either 30 minutes long or 60 minutes long, so listeners have handy building blocks to fill their car time. 30 minutes also gives the podcasters the possibility to add decoration such as jingles and music to their show, making podcasting more entertaining, but less productive.</p>
<p>My commute usually takes less than 10 minutes, so it makes no sense for me to listen to podcasts in the car. I listen to podcasts during my breakfast instead. I only take a sandwich and a coffee for breakfast, so the maximum podcast length is about 15 minutes. I searched around (why do none of the podcast directories have an advanced search feature where I can filter for podcast length?) and found only very few short podcasts. And out of this very few podcasts that fit my needs, 43 folders is my favourite.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have a love/hate relationship with personal finance. Ever since I have a computer I have been trying to get a grip on finances, with changing results.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My first attempt used the example Excel sheet created by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nibud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that came with Microsoft Excel. It was a nice and clever Excel sheet, but still living with my parents I only used part of it. After a while I stopped entering my receipts, and out went the Excel sheet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A little bit later I started playing with Microsoft Access. Access also comes with a financial example file, and I modified and tweaked it to fit my needs. But after all the hacking, all left to be done was entering receipts and numbers, which is a boring job. I guess I still didn&rsquo;t need personal finance, as I left the database alone after some months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some time later, a new phenomenon showed up: internet banking. My bank sent me some diskettes with an application that was able to import bank statements. Now that was easy! At first I tried to manage cash money with that application as well, but soon left that again. Internet banking was a success, as I have managed my bank accounts through that application until I could access my accounts through web pages. When later I started buying and selling stocks and stock options I could do that from the same application. That little application gave an overview of my bank accounts, but I still haven&rsquo;t been able to see where the money was going‚Ä¶</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The situation complicated when I started living together. I was not dealing with my money anymore, it was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our<!-- raw HTML omitted --> money. After some months the question came up: &ldquo;Where does our money go?&rdquo; We talked about it, and decided to implement a low-tech financial planning solution: pen &amp; paper. This worked great for some months, until we had more or less a picture of our expenses. Exit pen &amp; paper.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last year we were planning some big expenses, and I wanted to know whether these were justified, and how much time we would need to recover the invested money. Right about that time I read about an easy budgeting template in Excel, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pear Budget<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I downloaded it, sat down half an hour to fix the categories and the budgets, and have used it ever after. It is easy and fast to maintain, gives a good overview of our spendings. However, lately I had the feeling that I wanted more. Pear Budget shows me where the money is coming from and where it is going, but does not show what we have, and what we are expecting to have in the future. Besides that I wanted to make some changes in the categories I had set up last year, and that would mess up all past numbers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I started to look around for a more complete solution, that could offer me budgeting, but also import bank statements, manage investments, work in several currencies, schedule payments, ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I thought a moment about searching for a Web 2.0 solution, but quickly let go that idea as I wouldn&rsquo;t trust such a personal information to anybody. I looked at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microsoft Money Premium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but that seems a very US centred product, and is overly complex; I do not need my personal finance application to do tax statements.</p>
<p>After a little but more of searching, I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AceMoney<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a cheap but very complete solution that seems to fit my current needs. The user interface is not as shiny as MS Money, but it certainly does the job. Furthermore, AceMoney has been translated into many languages and even loads the local list of banks and categories.</p>

			 <p>As of version 3.31, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> natively supports tags.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are keywords or descriptive terms associated with an item as means of classification. Unlike categories, an item can have many tags to describe the item in several ways. Tags are well known from other (web) applications such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for tagging photos and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->del.icio.us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for tagging links.</p>
<p>The well known weblog search service <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technorati<!-- raw HTML omitted --> introduced tags to weblog entries, and allows for browsing and searching texts on weblogs by tag. Blog entries can be tagged easily by simply placing a few links at the bottom of the entry in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the right format<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[tagname]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> also supports tags, I hoped for a fluent integration with Technorati. Even though the default MT templates do not link the tags shown on the pages to Technorati but rather to an internal tags search on the current weblog, I hoped for a standard implementation in the RSS feed templates spidered by Technorati. And indeed I found a correct looking code:</p>
<p>Technorati automatically converts categories in the RSS feed to tags, and even though MT defines a new namespace, it should work correctly‚Ä¶ But unfortunately, the above code does not add the tag called &ldquo;technorati&rdquo; to the item, but rather the record number &ldquo;31&rdquo;.
When I tried to look up the specification at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag">http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I received a 404, so I still don&rsquo;t know whether Six Apart made a mistake when developing the new feed template or whether Technorati should have parsed the feed. Does anybody know whether either Six Apart of Technorati are working on this issue?</p>

			 <p>One of the biggest problems in scripting and programming is escaping quotes. Quotes have a special meaning, they are usually used for specifying the start and end of a string, such as in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><code>&lt;abbr title=&quot;eXtensible Markup Language&quot;&gt;</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But what happens when the string between the quotes also contains quotes? ‚Ä¶Errors!</p>
<p>There are several ways to prevent this situation. The two most common solutions are escaping the quotes by placing a special symbol in front of it such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and replacing the quote by its character entity reference <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;quote;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Why am I telling this? Well, this morning I was looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technorati<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s Favorites function, and noticed that something went wrong. When adding a site to your favorites, you have the posibility to attach tags to that site. The instructions for adding tags are clear:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t work that way! When I tried to add &ldquo;point of sale&rdquo; as a tag<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The following happened:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Technorati obviously tried to solve the quoting problem by replacing the quotes, but this change has a nasty side effect. Of course I have contacted Technorati about this issue, and will update this post when they reply.</p>

			 <p>Only a week after <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I closed down Brain Links<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Brain Links is back, albeit in a more simpler form. Before, each link had its own page, with a description and the possibility to comment on the link (which was rarely used).

<p>To power Brain Links, I no longer use Movable Type, but created a new widget that fetches the last ten links from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my del.icio.us account<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are no archives, no overview, no categories, no comments,‚Ä¶ just ten interesting links.</p>
<p>In case somebody also wants to create a del.ico.us widget, this is the code I used:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;div class=&ldquo;module-delicious module&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&ldquo;module-header&rdquo;&gt;Brain Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Insert the code above into a new system template called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Widget: del.icio.us linkroll<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and add the widget to a widget manager.

			 <p>After the succesful redesign of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I had gathered some momentum, and continued with the redesign of Brain Tags.</p>
<p>First of all, I reverted back to the basic Movable Type templates, as I had hacked the old templates to a level that made it very difficult to maintain and update. Actually, the latest update to version 3.31 broke my site at several parts.</p>
<p>When all templates were more or lass back to basic, I used the fantastic StyleCatcher plugin to change the look and feel. I selected a style called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make my way<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the Movable Type style contest. I know it is not very original, as there mioght be dozens of other blogs using the same style, but it is far better than I ever could make.</p>
<p>This is where it stands now. I still have some minor issues to fix, which will probably be done next week. What do you think about the new Brain Tags?</p>

			 <p>Since June 2004 I have posted 953 links to interesting, new and funny sites in the Brain Links section of this site. Today I have decided that I will stop adding more links.</p>
<p>I noticed the last months that little by little I am adding less links, and I started to wonder why. I started collecting the Brain Links as a reference site for myself; a place where I could look up those handy sites I saw a month ago. But the reality is that nowadays I hardly look back at all those links. It has literally become a link dump, a black hole for interesting stuff. I guess that subconciously I already figured out that it is not worth the effort anymore.</p>
<p>So exit to Brain Links. Soon I will start remodelling the Brain Tags site, just as I have done with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will probably result in a leaner site that is easier to maintain and update. At that point, the Brain Links will probably disappear completely, though I know that you should not break links..</p>

<p>It has been very quiet on this site, and that usually means that I am working on something. And indeed, I am working on the new site for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Besides that, the temperature in Lleida, almost reaching 40 ¬∞, makes that I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time behind the PC, but rather stay in the water of the swimming pool. As you might be worried what is going on here, I deceided to write a little bit about the new fimcap site.</p>
<p>We decided to implement the new site using the eZ Publish CMS, which allows for multi-lingual content and custom defined content types. This flexibility of course has a price: a steep learning curve. The basics are quite simple, but problems start when you want to modify templates. You literally can control everything, but you have to find the right template. Each page is made up from dozens of little templates, each of which can reside in several places.</p>
<p>Let me explain that in more detail. If you do a fresh installation, your site is configured to use two sets of templates: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->standard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which contains some bare-bones unstyled templates that make sure eZ Publish outputs at least something, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->base<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which adds a little bit of style. Of course, for your own site you want to use your own design, and you can either replace the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->base<!-- raw HTML omitted --> design, or add your own design, which is what we did. Now every time a template is called, eZ Publish first looks in the Fimcap design. If it can&rsquo;t find a template, it will search in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->base<!-- raw HTML omitted --> design, and finally it will fall back to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->standard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> design. So if I want to modify a template, I have to search in that order as well to find the currently used template. After a working for some weeks with the template system, I finally got the hang of it, and am able to find the correct templates quickly‚Ä¶</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re interested in the progress we&rsquo;re making, have a look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new.fimcap.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>When we were close to Andorra this weekend, we hopped over the border to do some shopping. We were looking for a new digital camera, and finally bought the Pentax A10. Of all cameras that matched our requirements, small form factor, minimal 3x optical zoom, quality optics system, the Pentax was the only one offering a usefull additional feature: stabilisation. The problem with small cameras is that it is very difficult to hold it steady, especially when using the zoom function. Stabilisation makes sure that pictures are still sharp under these conditions.</p>
<p>The coming days I will try out our new camera, so you might expect some changes on my photo page again.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have been playing a little bit more with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eZ Publish<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BryteNet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site. One little disappointment was that I could not generate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->friendly URIs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://brytenet.com/forum/">http://brytenet.com/forum/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I have to work with URIs as <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://brytenet.com/index.php?/forum/">http://brytenet.com/index.php?/forum/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. According to the eZ people this is because BryteNet has set up PHP as a CGI process and not through Apache&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mod_php<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which understands the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->accept_path_info<!-- raw HTML omitted --> function. The Brytenet servers implemented PHP as a CGI process for security reasons, and there is no way to change this in an easy way. I still don&rsquo;t understand why this is such a problem, as other PHP applications such as WordPress are able to produce friendly URIs.</p>
<p>Anyway, maintaining a site&rsquo;s content with eZ Publish is very easy. I have been able to set up the whole content structure in no-time, and even made some changes to the default templates. Templating is more daunting, as the template language used is very, very complete. For the moment I have only made some small changes, and have concentrated myself on the actual contents of the site.</p>
<p>Today I also created a Dutch version of the BryteNet site, which was done within 5 minutes! Now I am translating all content, which is done in a very clever way. A single object (text, folder, image,‚Ä¶) can have several translations, and depending on the way you access this object, one version or the other is shown. So going to <a href="http://brytenet.com">http://brytenet.com</a> gives me the default (English) view of the home page, while <a href="http://nl.brytenet.com">http://nl.brytenet.com</a> will show me the Dutch view of the same object. Very neat! I still have to translate the FAQ section, which for the moment will show the default language, even if I request the Dutch view.</p>
<p>When all has been translated into Dutch, I will add Spanish and Catalan too. And probably about the same time I will start tweaking my templates to change the components shown and the layout of the pages. The nicest job, making a unique design for this site, I will keep for the last, as it is the most logical order, and to have something to work to.</p>

			 <p>It has been some time ago since I last posted, so I thought I needed to spend some minutes to explain what is happening.</p>
<p>As usually when a site does not get updated anymore, I was simply too busy. First of all, I have been traveling. And in my case, travelling usually means working many hours (yes, I considder a diner with my client ‚Äòworking‚Äô) and a lack of Internet connections. This time my hotel did have two PC&rsquo;s in the lobby which I used occasionally, but I would have preferred an affordable (free?) WiFi connection in my room.</p>
<p>Besides travelling, I am preparing a datacenter move for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BryteNet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> server. As this is the first time that I am doing such a thing, I want to prepare it very well and get all the details right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for the moment. Until later&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Our house is one of the few places on earth where you can still find a television without remote control.</p>
<p>We have been thinking about upgrading it to one of those modern TFT or plasma screens, but have been waiting for affordable models that incorporate Digital Terrestrial Television. Until today‚Ä¶</p>
<p>DTT is available for some time now, but television sets are still running behind on this. This morning I ran into a very good offer for a Nokia Mediamaster 110 DTT set-top box.</p>

			 <p>I have been looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Personalized Homepage<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->GPH<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) before, but quickly decided that it has no additional use for me.</p>
<p>GPH offers you the possibility to add content (RSS feeds) to the Google Search home page, which is fine if you only use three or four news sources to stay up-to-date. But if you use several more news sources, you probably already use a feed aggregator to read them, and don&rsquo;t need the GPH.</p>
<p>I did like the idea of seeing the weather forecast on the homepage, but unfortunately neither Lleida nor Harmelen are available in the configuration of this widget. Microsoft does this better on their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Start.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> portal, since it does have information for Lleida, and correctly recognizes Harmelen to insert the weather forecast for Utrecht.</p>
<p>Today Google <!-- raw HTML omitted -->published an API<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for GPH, which hopefully will set a lot of creative programmers to work. At this moment I am only interested in two widgets: a better weather widget and an e-mail linked to my normal POP3 or IMAP mail, since I normally don&rsquo;t use GMail.</p>

<p>Looking up addresses is fast. The search function on my Palm and the excellent LookOut plug-in for Outlook are very fast. But updating information cost more. I regularly receive address changes from companies of friends. And if it is a big company I might have dozens of entries for it in my address list, which I have to update one by one. The same happens for friends and family. I usually have two entries for each ‚Äòcouple‚Äô, so I can store birth dates and mobile phone numbers. But they share the same address and home phone.</p>
<p>My ideal PIM application would store ‚Äòcontacts‚Äô in two separate but linked tables: an address and a person. If I change the address, it will change for all persons within that address. Yes, that would be great!</p>

			 <p>I just noticed that I have published exactly 499 entries on Brain Tags. Time to add number 500!!!</p>
<p>So this is number 500, a milestone. Not that it has been difficult to write that much articles, since it took me almost eight years (I wrote the first entry on November 24, 1997). Of course I didn&rsquo;t start writing regularly until I moved to Spain in 2001, when I had written only 27 entries in four years. You can follow my writing progress on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Entries &amp; Comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am still going strong, and still enjoy writing. So much that I am not only writing on Brain Tags, but also write on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->POS blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a Small Place<!-- raw HTML omitted --> business weblog of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BryteNet hosting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue until I reach 1000!!!!</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s continue talking about feed reading. Last week I described the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->five phases of feed reading<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I had observed. Or actually the first four phases are observations, while the fifth phase is purely speculation.</p>
<p>And exactly this fifth phase was the part I received the most feedback on. I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->somebody agreeing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with this tabloid view. I also received this e-mail from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Scoble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have to admit that I did not think a lot about the fifth phase when I wrote it down. It was simple the first idea that came to my mind, and I jotted it down. Raw blogging‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But after reading the reactions, I thought it oer again. What exactly do I expect? How would I like to receive my news?</p>
<p>The tabloid model and Memeorandum do a nice job in selecting, but there is one thing neither of them covers: they are both excellent in selecting the top stories which everybody likes, but fail to select the top stories <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like. There is no personalisation, and feed reading has everything to do with a personal experience.</p>
<p>What we really need is ‚Äòclever‚Äô feed readers, applications that know what I like and what I am not interested in.</p>
<p>My first idea is to use a Bayesian filter, which is already succesfully used to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->identify spam<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->route helpdesk requests<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on a big set of RSS feeds and have it select the most interesting items. I rarely have very original ideas, and there are many people spending more time on feed readers, so somebody must already have had the same idea, and maybe even already worked it out. A little bit of searching lead me to 0xDECAFBAD, who tried it out and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->found that it did not work so well<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I know that the idea is still new, and that this is just one test conducted by one person, but it is clear that more work has to be done in this field. For now I start playing with the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TailRank<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service, which partly solves my problem according to all those people who have written about it the last days.</p>

<p>Inspired by Jason Kottke, I entered phase 4 today. I regrouped all my feeds, and reduced the number of feeds in Bloglines. Furthermore I told Bloglines to notify me only when new items appear in my &lsquo;top&rsquo; folder. The first result has been amazing. I had a busy day, so only read my top feeds. I still have a feeling of what is going on whithout having to spend a lot of time reading.</p>

			 <p>I just received a cheque from Google. They pay whenever I pass $100, which in my case takes a while. But everytime the cheque arrives it is a happy moment.</p>
<p>The arrival of my cheque also triggered a chain of thoughts about advertising on my site. A little bit more than a year ago, I added the Google AdWords to this site. I simply took the existing pages, and looked where I could fit in the AdWords box. Since it was a test, I didn&rsquo;t spent too much time tweaking my templates; I just wanted to know whether it worked. In the past year I have made some minor changes, mainly to try out the AdWords program.</p>
<p>As I said, I had some thoughts about this whole advertising thing. One of these thoughts is that I should rethink the design of my pages so that the advertisements blend in better. If I take advertising seriously, I should also give the ads a better position on my pages (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->above the fold<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) of course without taking too much away from the content.</p>
<p>I also want to try out Chitika, which I heard gives good results as well. I placed some Chitika adds on my site, like the one above, and will monitor it during the next weeks. As you see, Chitika&rsquo;s eMiniMalls look far more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sexy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than Google&rsquo;s AdWords. But are they also more effective?</p>

			 <p>The past 48 hours I have been diving around in our brand new Toyota Corolla Verso, and I feel the King of the road. That feeling mainly comes because this car makes a lot more noise than our previous, old, car, and because it is so much higher. I can look over the cars in front of me, and see much more when I am passing dangerous crossing. In short, I feel more in control, and that is worth a lot when driving in a chaotic Catalan city.</p>

This visit to the Netherlands has been touristic than any previous visit, and we loved every minute of it.</p>
<p>Of course the fantastic weather helped a lot; it was sunny every day so we could spend a lot of time outside in nature and on the terrace. We visited amongst others Amsterdam, Utrecht, &rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch, Zeist, Amelisweerd, Lelystad, and Enkhuizen.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a small place<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a new blog I created today. You might be wondering why I am starting a new blog while I even haven&rsquo;t got the time to update Brain tags regularly!

<p>And now I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a small place<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, giving you a view behind the curtains of a small part-time hosting company.</p>
<p>I have started writing about what I did to set it all up, with todays article telling on how I got the idea to start a hosting business. Of course, Brain Tags readers already know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the answer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I included it for completeness.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a small place<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is also the first site I created in WordPress. For the moment the set-up is very basic (I only changed the default templates) but you can expect some more tinkering in the coming weeks. So far I have been impressed by WordPress: the installation was peanuts, and there is plenty of functionality. The user interface is not as sleek as the Movable Type interface, but I value function over looks anyway.</p>

			 <p>Street theatre is nice, since it is small-scale and personal. The acts are small, and the audience is small. That&rsquo;s why they got out of the theatre, and onto the street. That&rsquo;s why it is called street theatre. A great way to get to know street theatre is to visit a theatre festival. Edinburgh has the most famous theatre festival in the world, and T√†rrega has the most famous Spanish festival. T√†rrega happens to be quite close to Lleida, so tonight we&rsquo;ll be walking around in the streets of T√†rrega to see what is happening in the marvellous world of street theatre.</p>
<p>This year we found something curious. There was one show we really liked to see (Toni Alba), but this show is performed in a theatre. The curious thing is that we are going to look at a street theatre artist, those artists that are too small for a theatre, that is so popular that he&rsquo;s playing in a theatre. The other curious thing about this show is that it starts at 1:00 o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>

<p>The street where I live is just inside the ‚Äòblue zone‚Äô, the zone where you have to pay to park on the streets. The payment machines are activated on working days from 9-14 and 16-20, the other hours you don&rsquo;t have to pay.</p>
<p>I never pay, since these hours coincide more or less with my working hours, so I can park my car in front of our door for free. The only exception is the end of the morning: I work until 13:30, and usually arrive home 15 minutes later. So officially I have to pay 15 minutes, 15 eurocent, every day, which I never did until today.</p>
<p>When I come home I always pass the parking control, as they are talking to each other while waiting for the end of their shift. Every day I see them standing on the same corner, and I know that I can park the car in the blue zone without having to be afraid that they will fine me.</p>
<p>The controller on the photo might just have started this job and was simply doing his job, or she does not get along very well with her colleagues or maybe simply had a bad day and wanted to share this feeling ;-).</p>
<p>Anyway, the result was that I ended up paying for 5 minutes of parking to avoid problems.</p>

<p>So now our little Fiat Punto is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->back on eBay<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As I stated before, the car is old, 11 years, but in excellent state, and I am sure it will serve some years more for somebody who takes care about the car. Place your bid, or contact me for more information.</p>

			 <p>We all know that almost all comment spam is coming from virus infected PC&rsquo;s turned into zombies. For a while I suspected that these zombies work with a list of URIs to attack, since attacks always follow the same pattern: suddenly I receive a lot of comments from various IP addresses, but all using the same referrer and posting more or less the same message. Usually attacks take about two days before the comment spam slows down. Very few of all these comments make it through the Movable Type spam filters, and usually adding the URL to the blacklist takes care of them forever.</p>
<p>Since upgrading to version 3.2 I did not receive any single comment spam. The reason is that I forgot to rename the comment script. One of the first measures I took against comment spam was renaming this script, so bots using Google to find spammable sites would not find me. With the latest update, I forgot to do so. Now, the list with spammable URIs these spambots use, contain hundreds of links to a script that does not exist anymore. So they do not even reach my comment-spam filters!</p>
<p>Even better, they fall into another trap. I catch all request for ‚Äòinapropiate‚Äô files as system files and non-existing scripts (formmail.pl), and automatically put their IP address on a blacklist, which is cleaned up after two weeks. This blacklist has been growing like crazy the last week, due to all these MT-spammers requesting the old location.</p>
<p>Until they refresh their list, I can sit back and relax!</p>

			 <p>After I left Harmelen four years ago, I also stopped participating in youth activities. Of course I have done some work for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as their webmaster, but I never visited or participated in any activity.</p>
<p>Last weekend we went to Vall d&rsquo;Aran to spend 24 hours in a Roundabout camp.</p>
<p>Roundabout is a Fimcap project in which two groups from different countries spend their summer camp together. This Roundabout was between three groups (Germany, Malta and Catalonia), and this was the third year of the project. Since we knew the Maltese animators and most of the German animators very well, we visited them to meet our old friends again.</p>
<p>Because the group had been together for already a week and the participants knew each other from former years, we decided to stay on the background to not disturb the group dynamics. That gave us many possibilities to analyse the activity, and compare it to our own experiences. People active within a youth organisation already know that there are huge differences between groups within a single organisation, let alone the differences between different organisations from different countries ‚Äî this is one reason Fimcap is so interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, the atmosphere was very relaxed, and everybody was enjoying the activity. And we? We were very happy to meet our old friends again, and get up-to-date with all the gossip.</p>

			 <p>I just read &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to tip properly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; on lifehacker, and was very surprised to read about pre-tipping:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What a huge bullshit!!! Why did we let it go this far?!</p>
<p>First of all, tipping is a way to express my thanks for the delivered services. If I decide to pay a little bit extra, I decide how much I will give. In many places I read tipping rules like ‚Äúyou should always give 10%‚Äù, but for me there is only one rule: how do I value the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service delivered to me. I put emphasis on extra, since I always assume that normal service is already included in the price. I pay for a coffee, and you bring it. If I read in the quote above that I have to pre-tip in order to encourage the waiter to respond promptly to my needs, I&rsquo;d rather go to another place, since this waiter is simply not doing his job! He should be paid less, not more!</p>
<p>Furthermore, why do we only tip in bars and restaurants? Don&rsquo;t the hairdresser and the cashier of the supermarket work just as much or even more? And who ever gave a tip to the electric co.? OK, skip that last one, since they will never do something extra for me.</p>
<p>The point is, I see tipping as something general. If you do something extra for me, I pay you extra. If you deliver the basic service, e.g. you bring me my cup of coffee when I order one, I pay only the required amount. A tip is something you need to earn!</p>

			 <p>A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the shepherd‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?‚Äù</p>
<p>The shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully-grazing flock and calmly answered, ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p>
<p>The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his IBM Thinkpad and connected it to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas. He sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a response. Finally, he prints out a 130 page report on his miniaturized printer then turns to the shepherd and says‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou have exactly 1586 sheep.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat is correct; take one of the sheep.‚Äùsaid the shepherd.</p>
<p>He watches the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his car. Then the shepherd says: ‚ÄúIf I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my animal?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOK, why not.‚Äù answered the young man.</p>
<p>‚ÄúClearly, you are a consultant.‚Äù said the shepherd.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat&rsquo;s correct.‚Äù says the yuppie, ‚Äúbut how did you guess that?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo guessing required.‚Äù answers the shepherd. ‚ÄúYou turned up here although nobody called you. You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and you don&rsquo;t know crap about my business‚Ä¶ Now give me back my dog.‚Äù</p>

			 <p>Our car is about to reach 300.000 km, and the bills of the garage tell us that it is time to say goodbye to our Fiat Punto and start looking for something else.</p>
<p>The first question,new or second hand?, was quickly answered; as the second hand market is almost inexistent here in Spain. Everybody buys new and keeps driving it until the car reaches the same stage as our current car. We will probably end up buying a new car, unless we are lucky enough to buy a showroom model.</p>
<p>The second question, what kind of car?, was also easily answered: we live in the city centre, so big cars are out of the question. And considered my length and the fact that we regularly use the car to go away with our friends, really small cars are also not suited for us. So that leaves us with the regular tourist cars and MPVs.</p>
<p>Since every brand offers these models, we made up a list of all dealers in Lleida and started to visit them last Saturday. Unfortunately, almost all of them were closed, since the day before was a bank holiday! In the end we managed to visit the dealers for Peugeot and Renault, and came home with a lot of information about these cars.</p>
<p>We also bought some magazines with the typical list of all brands and models in the back, and while browsing all that information I quickly noticed that I simply had way too much information. I need a way to get rid of all surplus of information, I won&rsquo;t buy a Ferrari and don&rsquo;t have the slightest idea whether 150 Nm is OK or not, so fired up Google to search for the table in the car magazines in text or Excel format to play with.</p>
<p>Without success. It seems like all the car sites have been made only for car-enthusiasts. Usually the first selection you have to make is the brand and the model, which is exactly the information I want the site to give me! I am very disappointed in what I found.</p>
<p>When I am looking for a mobile phone of ‚Ç¨50, I have hundreds of sites to help me, but when I am making one of the biggest purchases of my life, I fall into the hands of the salesmen without any help from the Internet.</p>

			 <p>The temperature is slowly rising to a level where there are only two places to stay: inside an air-conditioned office or on the beach. This weekend I choose the latter, resulting in a lot of time to dream‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I thought about this site, and how I am only using a fraction of the available disk space and bandwidth.</p>
<p>What a waste! What if I just sold the space and bandwidth I am not using? Should be easy enough, I already us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cPanel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to manage the site, and I know that an additional script called WebHost Manager is available in which I can create new users and assign hosting packages. I could easily implement this without any additional cost.</p>
<p>What else should I need? A way to receive payments.‚Ä¶ Most hosting providers I dealt with use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2CheckOut<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to receive credit card payments, and I could open a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paypal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account as well. Both payment services take a percentage of the sales amount, both come without any set-up costs or monthly charges, so that&rsquo;s free of risk.</p>
<p>What else? I need to communicate with my clients. Some kind of helpdesk software, which also manages the client&rsquo;s orders and invoices and which can be linked to the two services above to cash in and preferably to WHM so accounts are generated automatically, after all, I rather spend my time on the beach.</p>
<p>There are some very good and complex packages available, but at this moment I am still dreaming, so I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much money, and certainly don&rsquo;t want to pay monthly charges. Google found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->phpCoin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which looks like it could be a good <!-- raw HTML omitted -->face<!-- raw HTML omitted --> towards my clients.</p>
<p>Mmmm, sounds like I could do it. Of course I have to spend some more time on the beach to think about details as the composition of the hosting packages I am going to offer and the name of my little hosting company (I already have some ideasj, and after that I need even more hours to implement all this and make a stunning design for the site. Will this dream ever come true???</p>

			 <p>I am a statistics junkie. I check the access statistics for this site at least once a day. Also the statistics <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FeedBurner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offers get checked regularly, so I know what the interest of my feed readers is.</p>
<p>Both statistics tell me where you come from and what you read while you are here. But that&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>I miss information on that last little bit of information about my website. What do you find interesting and where do you go after reading my texts? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MyBlogLog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gives my that information by tracking the external links you click on. Not with a clumsy redirect, but with elegant java-script. My addiction for statistics is fed again.</p>

			 <p>A little bit more than a year ago, I started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dumping links<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on this site. In a year time I added 650 interesting links, which serve as my knowledge base. It happens more and more that I start looking for information in the linkdump before going to Google. If I know that I have read something before, the chances are quite big I have dumped it there. The linkdump is my little section of the internet, with only the themes I am interested in.</p>

			 <p>With over seven years of blogging experience and after three years working in the international department of a POS software company, it is only logical to create a POS weblog. The point of sale world has a lot in common with normal PCs, but there are some differences. Old hardware (black and white terminals) goes hand-in-hand with the latest technologies (RFID), which make it a very interesting niche market.</p>
<p>Ten minutes clicking around in cPanel and Movable Type, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->POS blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was born! On this site I will publish news about Point Of Sale (POS) hardware and software and everything related to it. Please have a look at it, and let me know what you think about it.</p>

			 <p>Most computers have two input devices: a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse is mainly used to navigate in the GUI, while the keyboard is used to enter data. Both input devices need some training to get used to, though I still picture my father picking up the mouse from the table and moving it through the air.</p>
<p>Experienced mouse users are ably to move the pointer from one side of the screen to the other side to click on a tiny button within a fraction of a second, which is becoming increasingly difficult as the screen resolutions get bigger. Besides moving and aiming the pointer, they know how to use the three buttons and the scroll wheel at the right moment. Advanced mouse users sometimes use mouse-gesture enabled applications to perform even more functions with the mouse.</p>
<p>Experienced keyboard users are able to reach high key rates using all ten fingers. Besides high speed data entry, they also use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CTRL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ALT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> keys to navigate through applications.</p>
<p>I rarely meet persons who have reached the highest levels in using both devices. Mouse‚Äìwizards usually type with two (or three or four) fingers, while keyboard enthusiast loose time navigating. The problem is that we do not have enough hands. Efficient use of both devices requires three hands: two for the keyboard and on for the mouse. Depending on the type of work done mostly frequently, people become either mouse‚Äìaddicted or keyboard‚Äìbound.</p>
<p>In my work, I receive many interrupts and rarely work more than five minutes in the same application. As a result, my primary input device is the mouse. In the past I have tried to learn to type with ten fingers on the old mechanical typewriter of my mother, but due to my mouse use I have fallen back to a two finger system.</p>
<p>But things are changing. As my work slowly shifts from technical support to marketing and sales, I find myself writing more texts. And the more I write, the more I feel limited by my two‚Äìfinger technique. I write slow and make many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->mistakes. So I decided to use the mouse less and improve my typing skills, preferably using all ten fingers. I am aware that this is going to be very difficult, since old habits are hard to shake off and starting to write with ten fingers will initially decrease my typing speed even more, but I am convinced that I will be more efficient in the long term.</p>
<p>I do not have time to do a special training, but would rather learn it be gradually changing my habits. And of course a gadget freak like me needs some tools to help me. So the first step I took was to install <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ActiveWords<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my computer. ActiveWords is a wonderful application in which you configure words to trigger events. To open the Firefox browser, I simply type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and my favourite browser starts. The trick for me is that ActiveWords lets me start applications faster by keyboard than by mouse, even if I use ten fingers to type. Another benefit of ActiveWords is that the Misspellings plug-in corrects my mistypings within any application! It works exactly like the auto correct feature of Microsoft Word, but is works system wide. I have been using ActiveWords for some days now, and even though I sometimes enter the keywords with only two fingers, I am very happy about it.</p>
<p>Another tool which I am planning to use more is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emacs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the amazing extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor. Emacs interests me for its huge range of features, which all can be controlled by keyboard. In the past I have met some Emacs-wizards who were able to write and edit very efficiently and I have used it a little bit in my UNIX days. I am aware that Emacs has a steep learning curve but it looks like a long-term winner for me.</p>
