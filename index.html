			 <p>Whenever I show the new iPhone 13 Mini I bought a few weeks ago to friends or family, often I get the same reaction: ‚ÄúNice! But it&rsquo;s really small‚Ä¶‚Äù.</p>
<p>Yes, it is small, but that is exactly what I want from my mobile phone.</p>
<p>I know that the general consensus about phone sizes is to get the biggest screen possible in the smallest device possible, but my phone use is atypical.</p>
<p>For many people, and especially the younger generations, the phone is their main communication device. It is their most used ‚Äò<em>screen</em>‚Äô, on which they communicate with friends, watch videos, write their notes, read information and many things more.</p>
<p>If I look at the ‚Äòscreens‚Äô in my life, my phone comes at the fourth place.</p>
<p>My main ‚Äòscreen‚Äô is my computer. I not only use it for my work, but also for watching videos, playing games, writing, messaging and reading in my free time.</p>
<p>My second most used ‚Äòscreen‚Äô is my iPad, which I use mainly in our living room and at the patio. This device is mainly for information consumption: books, feeds, saved articles, videos, messaging and social networks. I also use it a lot for looking up information.</p>
<p>At the third position, we have our television. I don&rsquo;t watch a lot of TV, but still use it more than my phone.</p>
<p>That leaves my phone on the fourth position. I hardly ever use it when I am at home, as I usually have a way bigger screen available. For me, the most important function is to be mobile and easy to carry with me. That is why I chose the smallest possible device.</p>

<p>Last year I used my fancy pants camera to participate in the Micro.blog Photoblogging Challenge, but since I got a new phone last week I decided that this would be the perfect occasion for trying out mobile photography in different situations.</p>

<p>Today we finished the first part of the home entrance restyling.</p>
<p>Previously we had dark brown painted doors and brown tiles. We lightened things up by painting the tiles light gray and adding gray chalk paint to the doors for that <em>vintage</em> effect.</p>

			 <p>When the latest version of <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> came out, I decided to try to change my podcast listening workflow and use the built-in queue.</p>
<p>On the home screen, Overcast shows new episodes and I can long press them to add them to the queue.</p>
<p>Though it worked alright, it was more work than my previous workflow, so I switched back to to using my previous list.</p>
<p>I simply have an ‚ÄòAll podcast‚Äô playlist which collects all unplayed episodes. In this list, I have my own podcasts selected as priority podcasts, so they we&rsquo;ll always be on top of the list.</p>
<p>Besides that' I always listen to the episodes in the list in strict chronological order.</p>
<p>My personal rule is that this list can contain a maximum of 5 episodes. If this threshold is passed, I will delete the least interesting episodes to get down to 5.</p>
<p>In the rare occasion my playlist is empty, I will browse through the list of podcasts which I have listened to in the past but to which I am not subscribed.</p>

<p>The full explanation is simple. I do have the Telegram app installed on all my devices, but hardly ever use it to communicate with other people.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This tweet caught my eye this morning:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The issue of turned off cameras in zoom classes is, as many other issues, nuanced.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides in online workshops and can sympathise with both the teacher and the students.</p>
<p>A student might not have the fancy videoconference gear I have, nor a nice background. Maybe they are in their bedroom, maybe there are other people around‚Ä¶ They simply are trying to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>As a trainer, I have only once faced a completely blacked out camera grid while giving my workshop and it was hard.</p>
<p>Without any visual o audible feedback, you don&rsquo;t know whether the participants understand you, whether you have the right rhythm and speed, whether the participants air high in energy or need a break‚Ä¶</p>
<p>However, a good training, whether online or in person, is interactive. The days of the teacher giving a masterclass have long gone. Nowadays we know that learning takes effort and time together is valuable. If a teacher uses this valuable time only to pass information, he or she could better have recorded a video or send the information in written form. Being together does add nothing if there is no interaction.</p>
<p>Rather than passing information, a teacher should use the online session to answer questions, to work in groups on assignments, to discuss‚Ä¶</p>
<p>When the session flows and is interactive, the lack of turned on cameras will be no issue anymore.</p>
<p>And as a last resort, you can also ask a colleague to connect to the session with the camera on, so you hace at least one face to talk to.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A little over three years ago I gifted myself the <a href="https://ouraring.com/taf/dcc3320c00">Oura ring</a>. It served me very well, until the battery got damaged a few months ago after which it needed to be charged every two days. Fortunately, Oura has great service and they replaced my ring.</p>
<p>A few weeks after I received the replacement ring, Oura announced the third generation of the ring, with more and better sensors.</p>
<p>The minimalist in me decided that I have no need for a new ring. After all, mine was just replaced and should last several years without issues. Also, I don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> the ring, it is just something nice to have.</p>
<p>However, with the new ring, Oura also launched a subscription service to access the data gathered by this new ring. The previous model, which I have, does not need a subscription to access the same data. That is one more reason <strong>not</strong> to upgrade, but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I really like having an Oura ring and probably will replace my current ring with a new one once it wears down in a few years. And then I will have to pay the monthly subscription, unless‚Ä¶</p>
<p>If I upgrade now, I am eligible for a lifetime membership, saving a lot of money every  year. Today I made the calculation: If I would like to wear an Oura ring for four more years, it makes sense to upgrade now, so I will save money on the subscription.</p>
<p>It is not what I planned to do, but it makes sense to me.</p>

			 <p>A great tip from the Hulry newsletter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With more and more news sites moving their content behind paywalls, it&rsquo;s getting increasingly hard to read good news articles for free. Although supporting a publication with a paid membership is fantastic, there&rsquo;s a limit to the number of paid subscriptions you can have without breaking your bank. <a href="https://12ft.io/">12ft Ladder</a> will let you read paywalled content on most news sites for free by showing you a cached copy of the article.

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2021/11/07/you-can-do.html">This should be easier, Apple!</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday my father (84 years old) was writing a text message to his friends. While he composed his message, he complained that the order of the keys on the keyboard made no sense to him.</p>
<p>Of course, he never learned to type and never used a computer. ‚ÄúWhy don&rsquo;t they put the letters in alphabetical order?‚Äù
I guess he is right. The QWERTY layout makes sense when you type with all fingers, but probably is not the most efficient layout on small screens.</p>
<p>Immediately a thought came up in my head: ‚ÄùThere&rsquo;s an app for that‚Äú. And yes, you can install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/es/app/abcdef-keyboard/id1465367757?l=en">an alternative keyboard</a> with all letters in alphabetical order for only 0,99‚Ç¨.</p>
<p>To save my father the hassle of purchasing an app, I thought it would be best is I gifted the app. I initiated the process, but quickly ran into a wall, since Apple does not allow me to gift app from my Spanish Apple account to a Dutch Apple account. It surprised me, since we live in a global world‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Up to plan B. I asked my father for his phone and proceeded to purchase the keyboard app. Of course, my father never purchased any app, so I had to set up a payment method for his account. Apple offers several options here:</p>
<p>First there is the credit card/debit card. My father does not have a credit card, but does have a credit card. However, his card number is alphanumerical and the interface only allowed me to enter numbers. So I tried my credit card, but again, Apple won&rsquo;t allow a Spanish credit card be used for a Dutch account.</p>
<p>Then there was the option to use PayPal, which obviously my father hasn&rsquo;t got either.</p>
<p>Next in the list was the option to pay be telephone on selected carriers (of course, no mention of which those selected carriers are). I entered my father&rsquo;s phone number and pressed OK, but nothing happened. I assume that my father&rsquo;s carrier is not one of the selected carriers, but there was no error message at all.</p>
<p>Finally on the list was iDeal, a protocol developed by the Dutch banks specially for online purchases. My father&rsquo;s bank account does support iDeal, but he has never activated it. But my mother did, so the next plan is to have her purchase the app and then install it through family sharing.</p>
<p>I took my mother&rsquo;s phone, and tried to purchase the app, but got an error message telling me that I did not have enough balance on the Apple account. What?</p>
<p>After looking around a little bit, I found out that Apple had not implemented iDeal as a payment method, as most online stores do, but rather as a method to top up the balance on the Apple Account.</p>
<p>So I proceeded to use iDeal to get money on my mother&rsquo;s account. I transferred the minimum amount (1‚Ç¨), got passed to the banking app, accepted the transaction and got sent back to the App Store, which gave me an erro message. I tried it once more, with the same result. I checked the bank status and effectively saw that I had paid two times an euro to Apple.</p>
<p>5 Minutes later the balance of my mother&rsquo;s account updated and I could finally purchase the keyboard app.</p>
<p>Now I just have to install it on my father&rsquo;s phone. They have family sharing activated, but I could not see my mother&rsquo;s purchases from my father&rsquo;s phone. For that, I had to activate App sharing in the family sharing settings. And when I did that, I got an error message. In order to activate app sharing, you&rsquo;ll need a valid payment method‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I tried, and I tried and even though my mother has Apple Pay, iDeal and a positive balance on het Apple account, according to Apple she has no payment method configured, so there is no way to transfer her purchases to my father&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>What seemed a good idea, spend 0,99‚Ç¨ to gift an app to my father, ended up wasting almost an hour of time without being able to purchase the app.</p>
<p>This should not be so difficult Apple!</p>
<p>In the end, I spent another hour to teach my father how to send voice messages s he doesn&rsquo;t have to search for the keys on the keyboard.</p>

			 <p>All my Apple devices are relatively old. My philosophy is to use them as long as I reasonably can.</p>
<p>This also means that usually after the WWDC I only have one burning question: will I be able to update my devices?</p>
<p>Last year, Apple did not include my late 2013 iMac in the list, so it still runs Catalina (not an issue so far).</p>
<p>This year there will be no casualties.</p>
<p>I will be able to update my iPhone 7; even the 6S is still supported so it looks like I will be able to reach the 6 year usage target.</p>
<p>Also my iPad Air 2 is updatable, even though it is tha last device on the list so this will probably be the last update.</p>
<p>Historically there has been a lot of talk about Apple‚Äôs planned obsolescence and even though the devices are hard to service by third-parties, six years of OS updates is very good.</p>

			 <p>Today I received my <a href="https://www.rode.com/accessories/vxlrplus">R√òDE VXLR+</a>, a small device to connect my lavelier mic to my audio interface. The VXLR+ converts the 48V phantom power provided by the audio interface into 3‚Äì5V needed by my lavelier mic.</p>
<p>Until now I always used my lavelier mic with my phone, but for a while I‚Äôve wanted to connect it to my computer, so I have more freedom of movement when doing my online workshops.</p>
<p>However, my first attempt to use the VXLR+ was a failure since as soon as I connected it to the interface it generated a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Today I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to investigate, but tomorrow I want to try out a few things before deciding whether to return it.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I want to learn something, I am highly motivated and want to start right away. If you make me wait until your next group starts, I have probably already found an alternative way to learn.</p>
<p>And the few times I did enroll in a cohort-based training I had huge difficulties following the pace of the course. They either go too fast or too slow for me, which is really frustrating. My weeks are irregular and not all your material is equally useful, so I would like to accelerate and slow down at certain moments in the course.</p>
<p>I understand the motivational benefits of going through a course together with a group of likeminded people, but those effects can be accomplished just as well (albeit with a little more effort from the course maker) by creating a community around the course.</p>

			 <p>I always find it extremely difficult to rate books, movies and tv series.
First, whenever something is actually bad, I simply don&rsquo;t finish it and also cannot be bothered to rate it.
And when omething is good I have a hard time deciding wherer it was good or really good. It&rsquo;s so subjective‚Ä¶ Most works of art have some great parts and some good aspects. What exactly is the difference between ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ and ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ?</p>

<p>Only now, five months later, have I started looking at the new features in this version and I really love them! üíï</p>
<p>I disconnected the app from <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> and <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> (my feed server and read later service) and started using the built-in iCloud Feeds and iCloud Read Later services.</p>
<p>But the biggest improvement is <a href="https://bionic-reading.com/en/en-insight/">Bionic Reading</a>! Added to Reeder in version 4 (2019), it looks weird but actually works! I read with more focus and attention and am less distracted.</p>
<p>I switch Bionic Reading off when I triage my feeds, but when I switch too the Read Later section I turn it on for some slow and focused reading.</p>
<p>Have you tried Bionic Reading in Reeder or any other app?</p>

<p>I see a bright future for hyperscheduling tools, since they are the easiest way to be aware of the volume of current commitments. Timeblocking can quickly turn into a rescheduling Tetris, but automated tools such as Sorted and SkedPal eliminate this issue.</p>
<p>That said, I really liked the sorted interface.  They have some innovative ways to select and modify multiple items.</p>
<p>However, there is one important feature I am missing: <strong>due dates</strong>. I can work without do dates, but being able to control my deadlines is essential for me.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I write on my iPad, there are two problems which drive me nuts. Today I will explain one of these issues.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am well aware that this is a very first-world problem, but I expect Apple to care about the little details.</p>
<p>The issue arrises when I am writing a text and need to insert a special character, such as the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign. On my iPhone I can find this symbol in a logical, easy to understand way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign is not on the main keyboard, I tap the ‚Äò123‚Äô button to go to the numerical keyboard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are some characters on this keyboard, but not the symbol I was looking for. However, where the ‚Äò123‚Äô previously was, I now see ‚Äò#+=‚Äô, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign. There it is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That was easy and intuitive. Now let&rsquo;s see what usually happens when I try to do the same basic thing on my iPad:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Though there are more characters available, the ‚Äò+‚Äô symbol is not there. Yes, I know I can swipe down the ‚Äò√ß‚Äô key, but for the sake of this argument pretend that is not the case, as not all characters are available to swipe down and my fingers fail in swiping far enough about 20% of the time.</p>
<p>Just like on the iPhone, I have a button labeled ‚Äò.?123‚Äô to get to the numerical keyboard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the numerical keyboard I once again see the ‚Äò#+=‚Äô button, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is my issue, since the ‚Äò+‚Äô button is nowhere to be seen on the third keyboard. What went wrong?
The answer is on the second screen, so lets get back:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The problem is caused by the label of the button which brings us to the special characters keyboard. The button is labeled as ‚Äò#+=‚Äô just like the iPhone, but in this case all three characters shown on the button are already on the previous keyboard.</p>
<p>If Apple would simply change the characters shown on the button to characters actually on the third keyboard (I propose ‚Äò&gt;|^‚Äô), my monkey brain would not make the mistake to press it when I&rsquo;m looking for the ‚Äò+‚Äô character.</p>

			 <p>I just deleted <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a> from my phone. I have tried it for two weeks and have come to the conclusion that the platform in its current state does not provide any value to me.</p>
<p>The first week I tried using it as intended.</p>
<p>I betrayed the privacy of my contacts by uploading their information to the Clubhouse server and followed all of those who were already on the platform.</p>
<p>The first few days I listened in on a few rooms to understand how the platform works. Since about half of the rooms discuss about Clubhouse, this was easy enough. Then I went to the second stage, and once in a while, when I thought I had something useful to share I requested stage access. I even met a few new people.</p>
<p>After a week the constant stream of notifications started to bother me, so I dialled down the notification frequency to ‚ÄúVery infrequent‚Äú.</p>
<p>This week I also started thinking about why Clubhouse is such a success and why I don&rsquo;t feel it is a good fit for me.</p>
<p>First, the barrier to enter is very low. You&rsquo;re immediately welcomed by your friends, even if you didn&rsquo;t upload your contacts, since your friends already did. You can just enter and leave rooms until you find something interesting.</p>
<p>For me the biggest issue has been finding interesting rooms. It may be because of my contacts, but I found that in most rooms they talk either about what is Clubhouse, about online marketing or about both. Sometimes I found an interesting room in the ‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù list, but always at an inconvenient time. Furthermore, you can add future rooms to you calendar, but I&rsquo;d rather simply receive a notification within the app when the room starts.</p>
<p>I have met some people who spend several hours a day in Clubhouse, but that is not how I want to use social networks. I want to connect at a time that is convenient for me, and have an interesting conversation at that very moment.
Ah, and I prefer conversations with a small group of people instead of big rooms of listeners.</p>
<p>As it is right now, Clubhouse is set up as a conference center, with a few people speaking on stage and many listeners. I would prefer to see a version set up as a bar, where I can join a small table where everyone participates.</p>
<p>Until then, goodbye Clubhouse.</p>

<p>Now that we can&rsquo;t go to the mountains because of the lock-down, my life is a lot cleaner.</p>
<p>There are not many occasions to get my hand dirty anymore. The most muddy situation in my life nowadays occurs when I&rsquo;m cleaning the coffee maker.</p>

			 <p>The past two days I have been hanging around in <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a>.</p>
<p>So far I like it, though I would like to see a broader spectrum of conversation themes. So far, since the platform is full with online marketers, the main topics are &ldquo;What is Clubhouse?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can I use this platform for marketing my business?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think audio is the perfect medium for establishing conversations, since it&rsquo;s more personal and faster to produce than written text and it&rsquo;s easier to get professional quelity than video.</p>
<p>That said, Clubhouse is a closed environment. Surely, soon there will be Clubhouse clones in many forms, but I doubt any open platform will get enough traction to pass Clubhouse as the most popular option.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to have a conversation with you on Clubhouse. You can find me as always as <a href="https://micro.blog/JeroenSangers">@JeroenSangers</a>.</p>

<p>We prefer not to buy an Intel computer on the verge of a new architecture launch so we postponed the buying decision to today. In the unlikely event that Apple announces a new iMac with Ô£ø Silicon, we will purchase it right away. Otherwise, we won‚Äôt wait any longer and buy the current Intel-based model.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html">23 years of blogging</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-11-10 16:42:11 &#43;0200">Nov 10, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>23 years ago, I decided to add a page to my website where I explain what has been going on in my life. A few years later I learned that there was a name for such a page: a <strong>web log</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since then.</p>
<p>I have changed the blogging engine several times. The first page was made in Microsoft FrontPage, followed by hand-crafted Server Side Includes (SSI), the NewsPro CGI script and Movable Type, my favorite blogging engine of all times. Later, I decided that tweaking servers, databases and scripts was no longer a good use of my time, so I parked the blog on the hosted version of WordPress. And finally, this year I made the switch to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>Also the contents of the blogposts have changed in those years. Starting with a monthly post in Dutch summing up previous months activities in my life, I changed to writing in English when I migrated to Spain and wanted to keep an international group of friends up-to-date on my life here. When I got bored explaining my life I slowly shifted to a mixture of technology, humor, music and web standards. There also have been several years with hardly any new posts, as I focused on my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href="https://canasto.es">el Canasto</a>. As of last year, I am back to blogging again (mostly in English, but sometimes in Dutch or Spanish), (un)focused on a mixture of personal themes, interesting stuff I found on the web and some technology.</p>
<p>As for the future of this blog, seen my recent interest in publishing more (I even wish to publish daily), I think it is safe to say that the blog won‚Äôt go anywhere. Now that I have kept it alive for 23 years, I surely want to make sure to celebrate its 25th anniversary in two years.</p>

			 <p>Wise words from James Clear in his newsletter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid calendar debt. Don‚Äôt spend (free) time you haven‚Äôt earned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A meeting is like a loan: it is time you haven&rsquo;t earned yet. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since sometimes the inversion is worth it. Just be aware of this fact whenever you make a time-commitment.</p>

			 <p>In all the years of its existence, I have used several tools to maintain this site. From the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft FrontPage</li>
<li>NewsPro</li>
<li>Movable Type</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
</ul>
<p>Today marks the start of a new era, since I now officially joined the <a href="http://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> movement and migrated my 23-year old personal blog to <a href="http://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p>The import went flawless, and it was easy to set-up.</p>
<p>My only gripe is that I am still waiting for HTTPS to be activated, since appears to be done manually by the staff.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t request HTTPS while I haven&rsquo;t changed my DNS setting. This means that I&rsquo;m having a little bit of downtime, since all visitors will get an error message while HTTPS is not activated.</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s no issue, since I don‚Äôt get many visitors anymore (this site peaked fourteen years ago).</p>

<p>Four of the new mobility types, <strong>Step Length</strong>, <strong>Walking Asymmetry</strong>, <strong>Walking Speed</strong>, and <strong>Double Support Time</strong> have a paragraph similar to the screenshot above.</p>

			 <p>Last week I started writing up my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personal Knowledge Management Workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as part of that workflow.</p>
<p>You know, the best notes are about note taking, just like the most popular blogs are about blogging and the most popular YouTube videos are about creating YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Back to my notes.</p>
<p>When describing the concept of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->garbage in = garbage out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†I realised that it had been ages since I pruned the RSS feeds I consult each day during breakfast.</p>
<p>So I left my notes to take a deep dive into my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inoreader<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account. This turned out to be a multi-hour project, so I chunked the task as any productive human would do.</p>
<p>Then, when checking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†between two chunks, I ran into a post called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feed Reading By Social Distance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Ton Zijlstra. I loved the idea!</p>
<p>Until now I have always organised my feeds by¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->interestingness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, using numbered folders:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After reading Tom&rsquo;s post, I first renamed all my feeds with the author name. As Tom said: feeds express a personal relation.</p>
<p>I unsubscribed from most business and group blogs, with a few exceptions for some blogs run by two or three people I know well.</p>
<p>Then I dedicated several hours to reorganise the 242 remaining feeds into social distance based folders:</p>

<p>While reviewing all those feeds I also made sure they are all configured to use the ‚Äòhttps‚Äô protocol, that they use the current domain name (some blogs moved from using the platform&rsquo;s subdomain to having their own domain) and to use a current feed address.</p>
<p>Speaking of the latter, it surprised me to see that several blogs, including some high volume sites, still channel their feeds through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedburner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So there we are, all feeds organised and read. Not the only thing I can do to procrastinate a bit more is write about it on my blog‚Ä¶</p>

<p>&ndash; Douglas Adams in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last Chance to See<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I am no scientific in any way, but still remember the importance of the above statement from my chemistry classes. As an example, when you want to test the pH of a liquid using a piece of litmus paper, you have to make sure that the amount of liquid is large enough to eliminate the effects of the pH change inducted by the piece of litmus paper. In other words, using litmus paper to test the pH degree of a drop of liquid has a huge error margin.</p>
<p>I have this principle in mind with most things I measure. The inclusion of a piece of JavaScript on the pages of my web site in order to have Google Analytics collect data about my visitors has an effect on the user experience: the page loads a little bit slower. However, Google&rsquo;s infrastructure is fast enough so that the increase in load time is hardly noticeable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Many Twitter users also want to measure the efficiency and popularity of their tweets. The most common method of doing this is by using an intermediate server, the &lsquo;URL shortener&rsquo;, which registers each visit to the destination site.</p>
<p>In the first years of Twitter, URL shorteners such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit.ly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were necessary to prevent long URLs from using too many of the available 140 characters in a tweet. However, in 2011Twitter implemented their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own URL shortener<!-- raw HTML omitted --> inside their service so that each URL, including the ones passed through another shortener, only use 20 characters. Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>
<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet. Once again, this was true in the past, but nowadays Twitter gives <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excellent statistics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the number of favourites, retweets and answers to each tweet on their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->statistics page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Twitter&rsquo;s own shortener and external services is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transparency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you&rsquo;re linking to if you don&rsquo;t use an external shortener &ndash; and therefore just Twitter&rsquo;s service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>
<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Single Point of Failure<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>
<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expectation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was that tweets with shortened links get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clicked less<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit.ly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>
<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service, which was invoked by adding the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#tweko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>
<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chi-squared<!-- raw HTML omitted --> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <!-- raw HTML omitted -->calculate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more successful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (p = 0.0439).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not have any benefits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for me and it even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reduces clicks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>

			 <p>Version 2 of the popular OS X task management application <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Omnifocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is about to be released today. I have been testing the beta versions for some time and have seen how the software matured little by little.</p>
<p>Version 2 defers from the previous version in almost every aspect; it contains new features such as the review and forecast perspectives and also the user interface has been modernised. Especially the latter gave rise to many discussions on the support forums about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->data density of the new design<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Eventually, the Omni Group <!-- raw HTML omitted -->published a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hack<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to change the layout of the task list back to a table of tasks more similar to Omnifocus 1.</p>
<p>This made me wonder what other &lsquo;secret&rsquo; configuration options exist. So far, I have been able to compile the following list.</p>
<p>All configuration options are activated by opening a special URL starting with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in your browser, which opens Omnifocus and applies the configuration. The URLs in the list are clickable to apply the configuration directly form this post.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to switch to the compact layout, which only uses one line per task.  Note that this layout is experimental and still has some issues. To return to the default layout you can use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The alternative layout looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a perspective grouped by context, you&rsquo;ll see that empty perspectives will also show up in the main outline, to mike it easier to reassign tasks by dragging them to another context. If you would rather not see them, you can remove the empty contexts from the main outline with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can also pass the parameter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->true<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to reactivate the empty contexts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you put a project on hold, it&rsquo;s tasks will still show up in the forecast view. The reasoning is that even though the project is on hold, its tasks still have a due date. If you prefer not to see those tasks on the forecast view, disable them using <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to restore the default setting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This &lsquo;hack&rsquo; is a little bit more complicated. The issue was that the order of the perspectives in the sidebar could not be reorganised. Note that in the final release the default perspectives behave just like any other perspective, and can be organised in any way you like it. However, if you want to freak out with URL schemes, this is the way:</p>
<p>The default perspectives are on top (Inbox, Projects, Contexts&hellip;), followed by any starred perspectives. To add another perspective, you first have to star the perspective and open the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get a list of the current tabs. Note the ID of the starred perspective, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hdDT8UyDkVe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in this case:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once you know the ID of your custom perspective, you can define the order of the tabs with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whenever you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clip<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something from another application, the Quick Entry window shows up so you can specify some further meta-information about the task &ndash; project, context, dates&hellip; &ndash; and change the task description. If you would rather send the clipped information directly to the Omnifocus inbox, use the configuration URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are two setting for configuring the synchronisation interval. First, you can set the maximum sync time &ndash;in seconds &ndash; with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (this sets the maximum to 10 minutes). Use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to restore the default setting of one hour.</p>
<p>The other option is for setting how long after making an edit Omnifocus should synchronise. The URL is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get back to the default setting of one minute.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have setup your mac to use the &lsquo;Graphite&rsquo; appearance instead of the default &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; theme, Omnifocus will have black and white icons in the toolbar instead of the modern coloured icons. If you prefer this to be different, you can use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to force the use of coloured buttons or <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get the black and white icons in the toolbar. As usual, with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> you&rsquo;ll go back to the default setting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This option was contributed by Colter in the comments of this post. When in Forecast view, you can drag a task to another date in the calendar to change its due date. You can change the defer date instead by holding the ‚åò key. If you would like to change the defer date by default, you can use the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re using folders, OmniFocus will show the complete path in the project selection drop-down list using a colon as the hierarchy separation character, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personal : Finance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can configure the character used to separate the project hierarchy with the URL <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->omnifocus:///change-setting?OFMNamedObjectHierarchicalNameSeparator=%20:%20<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->%20<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the code for a space).</p>
<p>Please leave a comment if you know of any other configuration option for Omnifocus 2; I will keep this post up-to-date.</p>

			 <p>In preparation for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iCloud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> launch in autumn, I have been thinking about its impact on my use of Apple services. Our family uses several <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iDevices<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the better syncing options offered by iCloud will be very welcome. However, I have some concerns about purchasing and synching.</p>
<p>At this moment I use two different accounts to access Apple&rsquo;s services: I have a regular Apple ID which I use for purchasing Apps and home sharing media, and I also have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MobileMe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account for synching data between my Macbook and the iPhone. The MobileMe account is used just by me, while all iDevices share the same Apple ID for the obvious reason that I don&rsquo;t want to purchase apps twice. Furthermore, by using two separate accounts we are able to access all iTunes libraries from the AppleTV, without being obliged to synchronize calendars as well, as those are being synched using another account. In short: the Apple ID identifies the family/home, while MobileMe is used to identify a person.</p>
<p>When Apple activates iCloud, my Apple ID will also become the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->token<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for synching information, which is a problem for me. I would like to continue using the Apple ID to make purchases for the whole family and stream media between the devices of our family, while on the other hand each member needs a personal ID for synching calendars, mail accounts and other personal data. When Apple closes MobileMe I will be forced to sync my calendar through iCloud, but my wife has no interest at all in my appointments (and vice versa).</p>
<p>As far as I have been able to find out, iCloud will not offer such granularity. I assume that my situation is quite common and that many families with several devices will face the same issue. Does anybody know a solution for this problem, or do we simply have to wait for the final version of iCloud and hope that Apple has already a solution?</p>

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2011/06/28/googles-step-verification.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-06-28 16:58:01 &#43;0200">Jun 28, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Google has released a new security measure to help you protect your ever increasing amount of data stored on their servers. This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2-step authentication<!-- raw HTML omitted --> means that when you log in to your Google account with your username and password, you will receive a code by SMS message. Only after entering this code you will be able to get to your data.</p>
<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data on Google&rsquo;s servers (I hardly ever use Gmail or Google Docs, mainly just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Reader<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) I thought that it was a good idea to activate this service &ndash; better safe than sorry, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I went ahead and activated the service. The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup verification codes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky &lsquo;finder&rsquo; the possibility to get into your Google account <!-- raw HTML omitted -->without<!-- raw HTML omitted --> needing the SMS confirmation.</p>
<p>I immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that &ndash;with the current roaming rates in Europe&ndash; they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Satisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for iPhone, FlipBook, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for iPad, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Earth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.</p>
<p>I know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google&rsquo;s servers. To me it makes no sense that &ndash;even though one application increased its security&ndash; the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.</p>
<p>I finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can&rsquo;t use Google anymore as my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenID provider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web &ndash;those that require registration&ndash; I want to comment on. Too much of a hassle to be functional&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After some weeks of work &ndash;though I only spend 1-2 hours every week on this project&ndash; I am re-releasing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->brain tags<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have lost the count of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->version numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of this blog, but is should probably the 6th or 7th overhaul. I am very excited about it, as I see it as a fresh start with some important changes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After many, many years, I have exported all data from my old <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installation, and installed a fresh copy of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Melody<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on a fresh new account. For those who are not familiar with those two applications, Melody is a fork Movable Type version 4.</p>
<p>I choose to move to Melody for several reasons. First of all, I was not completely happy with the latest versions of Movable Type, which added a lot of unneeded bloat, such as the possibility to create <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sites<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In fact, Movable Type obliges you to first create a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be able to create a weblog. But the biggest reason is the fact that support for Movable Type is decreasing, now that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->owner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is focussed on advertising, and development on Movable Type takes place in Japan.</p>
<p>Melody was created by two former employees of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash;one of them was product manager for Movable Type&ndash; and a very active community member. They have already been able to solve a lot of the main issues in Movable Type in Melody, and I simply trust more in them than in the current developers of Movable Type.</p>
<p>A final note on the change: while both Melody and Movable Type can handle multiple blogs and I traditionally have managed all my blogs from a single installation, I am now separating them again. This way I can make my customizations without making my other blogs more complex. It also gives me a way to test out things.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Melody comes with a very nice minimalistic theme as the default theme, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DePo Clean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I decided to keep it. For the moment I haven&rsquo;t personalized the templates, though I did fix some minor bugs in the theme. Once I figure out how to make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->diff<!-- raw HTML omitted --> files, I will probably submit the patches to the Melody developers.</p>
<p>I do have a list of wishes and desires for the theme, so don&rsquo;t be surprised when things change over time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even though the combined Akismet and Typepad spam filters are very effective, I still had to deal with several comments in the moderation queue every week. Since nowadays there are plenty of other ways to express your opinion, I have disabled the comments function. If you want to share your opinion, feel free to send me a [tweet]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->6<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When importing the old entries, I left out all decorational images. In the last years, I always accompanied each post with an image to make the post more attractive. Those images are now gone, you will only find images which help making my point. I want the focus to be on my words, and will also try to write longer, more thoughtful posts from now on.</p>
<p>I am very excited about this new start. What do you think?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The mobile revolution is shaking up the software market. Old paradigms (bigger is better) disappear and new ones are created.</p>
<p>One area where these changes are specifically noticeable is the relation between applications and the file system.</p>
<p>Most computing environments are in what I call the second generation, where the file system is the dominant part of this relation. The file is the centre of our activities. To start working we open a file and the associated application is automatically launched. We only start application directly when we want to create a new file.</p>
<p>This has not always been like this: in the past (first generation) the applications were the core, where applications gave access to data on the mainframe or in databases. There are some situations where we work in applications without having any idea of the underlying file- or database structure. E-mail is one of the uses of this system.</p>
<p>Like I said, the mobile revolution is changing this again. Mobile operating systems as iOS, Symbian and Android give very limited access to the file system and force us back to the mainframe era. Even the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> operating systems don&rsquo;t give you direct access to the file system anymore, but rather a virtual system mounted on top of the real file system.</p>
<p>It looks like file system abstraction is the future, but I don&rsquo;t think that applications will be the centre of our universe. The operating system of the future won&rsquo;t be centred on files or applications, but will use processes and tasks as the leading parameter.</p>
<p>In the operating system of the future, you will be able to say that you want to write, and a simple text editor will open. The moment you access more advanced editing functions, the application will automatically switch to another editing engine. Of course, you text is automatically saved and can be used in many ways.</p>
<p>In the future, operating systems will actually help you being productive. Trust me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A recent trend in the blogosphere has been to add <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweets as comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on posts. I understand where this comes from, as in general commenting on blog posts has decreased in favour of twittering. By adding all tweets mentioning your blog posts, your posts look more alive and will probably attract more readers.</p>
<p>Whenever I think about features for my blogs, I always ask myself what the value is for my readers. In the case of tweets as comments, I look for the answer based on my own experiences. It happens frequently that I find an interesting post with let&rsquo;s say 20 comments. When I finished reading this, otherwise interesting, blog post and get ready for participating in the conversation, I find out that there actually are only two real comments, followed by a tweet of the author and 17 retweets adding absolutely nothing to the post or the conversation. Immediately my motivation to participate in the conversation is gone and I quickly move on to the next blog.</p>
<p>Although in theory tweets are comments about your posts (or at least mentioning the post), they hardly ever contribute to the discussion. If you absolutely want to display the tweets on your blog post, go ahead, but don&rsquo;t mix them with the comments. If in the example above the tweets would have been separated from the comments and the blogs metadata would have shown me that the post has 2 comments and 18 tweets, I would not be so disappointed and probably would have left a comment as well.</p>

			 <p>One of the most interesting parts for web site owners are the access statistics, and Google Analytics offers one of the most complete statistics solutions, which I use on a weekly basis for my most successful blog <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Besides being a typical blog with pages, I offer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->calendars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for downloading, and of course I also want to track those downloads. When two years ago I started with the downloads I search Google&rsquo;s help files for a solution to track them, and found a small javascript sniplet that when a visitor clicks on a download link registers the download as a pageview. This trick allowed me to analyse the downloads.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this trick is that it inflates the pageviews, and I never have been completely satisfied about this solution. You can imagine my happiness when last week I discovered the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Tracking<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feature, designed specifically to track downloads, videoplays, etc.</p>
<p>I quickly changed my code to use a javascript sniplet like the following:</p>

<p>Last weekend I attended the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evento Blog Espa√±a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> conference in Seville, and one of the more attractive talks on the schedule was called 2.0 services and technology in business by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Luis Su√°rez<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, technology evangelist at IBM.</p>
<p>Luis explained how he stopped using e-mail completely and replaced the functionality by a variety of web 2.0 tools, each specialized for a specific task. When he started talking, I remembered how Tim Ferriss also &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; e-mail in his book.</p>
<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The 4-Hour Workweek<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Tim explains how he only reads his e-mail a few times per day while an autoresponder tells the senders to use the phone instead for more urgent messages. I have read it several times, but I still can&rsquo;t see where the productivity increase comes from. I&rsquo;d rather check my e-mail twice a day to reduce phone calls. In my opinion, phone calls are a bigger time waster that e-mail. When someone phones you, that person decides for you that the issue he is phoning about is at that moment more important than all other issues you are working on. A phone call is almost always an interruption in your workflow, while e-mail is part of the workflow. Of course, there are times when a phone call is justified, for example when a customer is having technical problems that stopped his business. The idea is to use the right tool for the job, and in the past years I have spend quite some time explaining that the phone usually is not the right tool and that e-mail or IM for more time-dependant questions are more adequate.</p>
<p>Using the right tool for the job is exactly why Luis Su√°rez stopped using e-mail and changed it for instant messaging, wikis, blogs, rss, bookmark services, quickr, etc. In principle I agree with Luis that e-mail is not always the best tool to use, but at this moment there is a scattering problem when using web 2.0 tools. I already noticed this when I try to convince people to stop phoning me and use IM instead. There is a myriad of IM tools and protocols available, and to be able to communicate with all my customers I need ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Messenger, Skype and GTalk. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of them!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I am a tech savvy guy, so I can handle this (all accounts are nicely accessible from one client: Digsby), but this surely is no option for many other people, who already find it very difficult to install one IM client.</p>
<p>Now imagine the same thing happening with all other functions of e-mail. To collaborate on a document there are dozens of services available. Of course I will choose one of them, but will me customer also use that? Of course not, they use Google Docs instead of a wiki. And as I cooperate with more people, my shared work will be shattered across the internet. I remember a customer send me a link to an interesting article, but where is it? I need to maintain a database to know that this particular customer uses Delicious to share bookmarks.</p>
<p>You can say a lot about e-mail. It is not the perfect tool for collaboration or status reporting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it is a standard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Everybody has e-mail, and everybody knows how to use it. And if you work together with many customers, using web 2.0 solutions will not be an option in the majority of cases, until there will be a common protocol or tool such as Digsby for IM that allows people using different services for a functionality to cooperate.</p>

			 <p>Today I launched the new design for Brain Tags. For a while I have been using the default theme provided by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but after updating the blogging engine to version 4.2 I decided to make some changes to make fully use of the new features offered by this version.</p>
<p>The theme I used is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mid-Century<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and is a good example of the possibilities of the latest version of Movable Type Pro. To improve speed and stability, I used a static publishing model, while using cached modules for some of the sidebar widgets. That way I can easily update for example my Latest Comments widget without having to rebuild all individual archive files.</p>
<p>With this redesign I also stopped using Google Adsense, as the income generated was simply too low to justify its use.</p>
<p>In the coming days I will probably be making some little adjustments to adapt the new design to my tastes and needs.</p>

			 <p>That is the question I have been asking myself a lot this year. In the past I always had a clear answer to this question, but lately I struggle with the aim of this site, which is why it has been very silent over here.</p>
<p>The first incarnation of Brain Tags was simply to inform my friends abroad about what was going on in my life, which was a very novel idea back in 1997.
The second incarnation of Brain Tags in 2001 still had the same aim, but intense due to my emigration to Spain.</p>
<p>After some years the content started shifting to include web design and other technology topics. I got settled in Spain, and my daily life was not so interesting anymore‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And now that blogging has become very mainstream (my wifes mobile phone comes with a blogging client installed!) and there are a thousand blogs writing essentially the same, I wonder what the place of Brain Tags is.</p>
<p>For a while I thought about closing Brain Tags, but then I decided that I do have a very clear and sometimes unique opinion about many subjects. So I do want to continue writing here, but probably in a different format. I think that shorter articles with some original thinking (less copying/forwarding stuff from others) will be the way to go. I will also incorporate some other things such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> steams etc. in the blog design.</p>
<p>Be prepared for changes, Brain Tags is alive!</p>

<p>The course is divided into five parts: Instructional design, marketing, creating multi-media content, business models and building membership sites. The more technical parts are not that interesting for me (just some links to the software used is enough for me), but the other three courses are well worth the money. Furthermore, the forums already brought some very good contacts, and I might be setting up some joint-ventures to start building membership sites.</p>
<p>My first ILE project will probably be a Spanish productivity course (what else?), on which I will start working in a few months (of course I am already doing some brainstorming now‚Ä¶)</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s continue our trip through the history of Brain Tags at 1998, my second year of blogging.</p>
<p>I celebrated my birthday party in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->De Jeugdhof<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and after cleaning the floor we forgot to close the fire hose. The next morning when we came back to finish cleaning we encountered a swimming pool instead of our cleaned floor. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oops<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I also went to Africa and visited the very interesting country of Lesotho. Of course, still being a rookie blogger I only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slightly mentioned<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this instead of writing a post with high Google juice. Missed change indeed.</p>
<p>I also had the worst skin problems I remember and had to stay home for several days because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my face was severely infected<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still don&rsquo;t know what caused it (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->allergy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?, stress?), but fortunately it didn&rsquo;t return after 1998.</p>
<p>Then there were of course some stories about Jong Nederland, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kaderschouw<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Night of 16+<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, planning the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EuroContact<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the famous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->volleyball tournament<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Utrecht district.</p>

			 <p>Two years ago, reflections were cool and something new. Reflections gave your web site or your application a crisp look.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even the big operating systems and television stations have reflections and thus reflections as a design element are outdated. I am surprised, even irritated, by the big number of startups still using reflections in their logo or their screendumps only to look &lsquo;cool&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Get over it. Reflections are soooo 2005.</p>

			 <p>I could simply write here that I am too busy to write on Brain Tags, but I guess it is more interesting for you to read what I am doing currently. So this is a short list of my most interesting current projects:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a project on which I have been working for a long time (not always as active as now) and which should have been finished a long time ago. I am now finishing off the new design, after which we can finally show the world the work we have been doing. Working on a graphical design is quite an adventure for a technical person like me. I can easily tell whether I like a design or not, but to make one yourself is a whole different thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hopping along with the Fimcap redesign, I am also reworking the site where I station my side-business. Both sites are built on eZ Publish, so I use the experiences on ons site to advance on another. I am also working to leverage some of the karma I got with blogging to new profitable projects under the Brytenet umbrella. You will read more about that when these plans have crystallized a little bit more. Anyway, currently the Brytenet site is off-line while I restructure the content, but before next week I hope to be open for business again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is still one room in our house where we didn&rsquo;t do anything since we moved in, the room where our visitors sleep. Those who have visited us can confirm that the beds in that room have had their time. So we are going to use our holiday in November to get rid of the current furniture and paint the room. In the mean time we are already looking for two new beds and a wardrobe to provide our guests with better rest and ourselves with more storage room.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally I started an on-line course about making on-line courses (?) called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Teaching Sells<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will probably help me getting all that information I have been absorbing over the past years out of my head and into my wallet. I am sure some very interesting new projects will arise from that course.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The blogs are still there, and will stay, though I am considering stopping to write on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>When I started using the default templates coming with Movable Type 4, I missed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recent Comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget. Below I explain how you can add create this widget and ass it to your sidebar in true MT4 style.</p>
<p>In the Movable Type administrative interface, go to Design &gt; Templates &gt; Template Modules and open either the ‚ÄòSidebar - 2 Column Layout‚Äô or the ‚ÄòSidebar - 3 Column Layout‚Äô template module, depending on which one you are using. Scroll down until you find a line with `` and paste the following code just above that line (you can of course also choose another position for the recent comments widget):</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-archives widget&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&ldquo;widget-header&rdquo;&gt;Recent Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-content&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&ldquo;widget-list&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;li class=&ldquo;widget-list-item&rdquo;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&gt; on &lt;a&lt;br /&gt;href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now in any template where you want to show the recent comments (e.g. the main index template or the individual archive template) you add the following line: ``
Rebuild your weblog, and it should show you the five latest comments in the sidebar, just as you can see on this blog.</p>

			 <p>Widgets are the fastest and easiest way to configure your sidebar. Just open up the widget administrator and drag and drop widgets on the sidebar. A great feature for novice bloggers, who don&rsquo;t have the technical knowledge to tweak sidebar templates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the default Movable Type templates don&rsquo;t use widgets, which means that to enable widgets on your site you will have to tweak the sidebar template‚Ä¶ ouch!</p>
<p>I know, the default sidebar template offers a far more advanced features than the widget engine can offer, with variables and MTIf constructions. The default sidebar template is a lot cooler without widgets, but also very hard to tweak.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the default sidebar template should include a check on the number of widgets configured. If no widgets have been configured, it should show the fancy sidebar, but as soon as I configure widgets, it should hide the normal sidebar and show the widgets. This is also what many templates in WordPress do and gives you the both of two sides: a fancy sidebar for starters which is easily adaptable by weblog owners.</p>

			 <p>As of today, Brain Tags is not a stand alone blog anymore, but uses my central Movable Type installation at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ai-No<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Hopefully you haven&rsquo;t noticed anything of the changes, as I have been able to limit the downtime to only two minutes (the time necessary to delete an account from the web server and configure an add-on domain.</p>
<p>As Ai-No has its own blog which I will use for meta-blogging, there will obviously be less meta-blogging going on over here. So this blog will concentrate more on technology, web development and my life in Spain.

			 <p>Lately, especially since I use Twitter, I receive a lot of URLs in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TinyURL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> format. That made me think: if TinyURL gives out a unique URL each time it is used, when will they run out of URLs?</p>
<p>On their site they state that they have more than 42 million of them, which doesn&rsquo;t sound like an awful lot. All TinyURLs I receive have a six character identifier, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3bso2z<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A little calculation (six positions with 36 options per position) gives me 2.238.976.116 unique identifiers. More than two billion, that sounds already better. And if they run out of Ids, they can simply use seven or eight characters, which I still consider tiny. Eight positions give 2.984.555.162.628 (2 trillion!) unique identifiers!</p>
<p>It is clear: TinyURL is here to stay.</p>

			 <p>Now that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type 4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been released and leaped ahead of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the old discussion of static publishing versus dynamic publishing shows up again. Movable Type by default uses static publishing (it generates static HTML files with are served to the visitor) while WordPress uses dynamic publishing (all content is served directly from the database). What method is better?</p>
<p>As usual, the answer is: it depends‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Static publishing requires less server resources per visit, but it takes longer before updates (entries, comments and template changes) are visible. With dynamical publishing, your changes are immediately visible to your visitors, but you&rsquo;ll need more power to serve those pages.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For most bloggers it won&rsquo;t make any difference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as they hardly tweak their templates and receive few comments and visitors. However, if you like tweaking your templates, you might want to go dynamic, and popular blogs are better off going static.</p>
<p>But wait, I can hear you think: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there are some very popular blogs using WordPress‚Ä¶<!-- raw HTML omitted --> That&rsquo;s right, and without exception they use some kind of caching method to lower the server stress. On the other side, Movable Type can also run in dynamic mode (which is what I use for this blog), and you can specify for each template whether it should be served statically or dynamically, allowing you to optimize your site&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: for low-traffic sites, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you publish static or dynamic. If you have many visitors you probable want to use static or hybrid publishing.</p>

			 <p>The productivity guru of the moment, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim Ferriss<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, writes in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how he was able to reduce the amount of e-mail received by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->setting up an autoresponder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to tell that he only reads his e-mail once a day and that it is better to phone him for urgent matters.</p>
<p>I believe him, when he tells that this technique has reduced his e-mail load significantly. But what he doesn&rsquo;t tell is what happened to the number of telephone conversations he received. In my case, I notice a clear increase in telephone calls when I am very busy and cannot answer e-mails within the usual 12 hours. And guess what, when I am very busy, the last thing I am waiting for are telephone calls! When somebody phones me, that person decides what I will be doing for the next two minutes and when I will give attention to him (now!), while with e-mail I am the one deciding who should get my attention and when.</p>
<p>Tim&rsquo;s trick only works because his workload is very low. When you&rsquo;re workload is higher and you need to spend more time in the zone, it makes more sense to change your voice mail message to tell people that you can only be reached by phone during one hour a day and that they get faster response when they send their inquiry by e-mail.</p>

			 <p>For quite some time I have been happily using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coComment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For those who don&rsquo;t know this service: coComment basically keeps track of the comments you leave on web sites. If you&rsquo;re like me, reading and commenting on many sites, it can be difficult to track the replies to your comments. coComment captures your comment and tracks the conversations started by those comments on a single page instead of having to revisit all sites you&rsquo;ve commented on.</p>
<p>Yesterday coComment released a new version, bringing more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->social<!-- raw HTML omitted --> features. By doing that, they threw out the real value of their service: tracking conversations. The new page reserves 75% of screen real estate for groups, friends, favourites and neighbours, leaving just enough space for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only five conversations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Furthermore, all my conversations have been marked as unread, and I could not find an option to mark them all as read. This is not an upgrade, this is a downgrade!</p>

			 <p>Whenever I had an idea for a blog post, I used to create a new entry on that particular blog, jot down my idea, and save the post as a draft. As soon as I had more time, I checked the list with draft posts, chose a draft, and finished the post.</p>
<p>What had worked perfectly for a long time, lately became a burden. The problem is that over the time I have collected a great number of interesting themes to write about, resulting in a big amount of drafts. Some of those drafts only contain an URL, while other are more elaborated. In short, it became too difficult to find out quickly what was what.</p>
<p>So now I have changed my blogging workflow. I transferred all my ideas to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Notebook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where they are nicely ordered per blog. On that page I can see all ideas with their actual content at a single page. One glance on my Notebook, and I can quickly decide what to write. Furthermore, with the Google Notebook Firefox extension I am able to select a text on a random web page and copy it together with the address of the page to my Notebook.</p>
<p>From now on, drafts in my blogging software are actually pieces I already have started to write, which usually are only a few. This set-up keeps things clear, and speeds up my blogging workflow.</p>

			 <p>Holiday is over, the hard life is back!</p>
<p>After a bad start, our holiday was great! We spend one week in St-George&rsquo;s-de-Didonne (tasting oysters and great wines at the beach) and one week in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port (hiking in the mountains and eating some of the best tapas).</p>
<p>One of the first things I did after coming back was fixing this site by upgrading Movable Type to the latest beta release. Of course I know that I shouldn&rsquo;t have upgrated the software just before leaving for vacation, but I took the bet and lost‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Next week we&rsquo;ll be going camping in France. That means amongst others that we will be making quite some kilometres, and if you know me a little bit you know that I am not that fond of travelling large hours.</p>
<p>One way to make the trip more pleasant is music.</p>
<p>The traditional source of music was the radio, but when travelling long distances in several countries, you&rsquo;ll loose your station every two hours. The past years we brought some CDs with us, but CDs are bulky and we can only take a few of them.</p>
<p>For this year&rsquo;s trip, I bought a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Belkin TuneBase FM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, allowing us to listen to all the music stored on MJ&rsquo;s iPod.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The TuneBase converts the iPod into a radio station. It has four button to select pre-stored frequencies and up and down buttons for manually selecting frequencies. All we have to do is tune our car radio to the TuneBase frequency, and we can listen to all the music stored on the iPod.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re ready for the trip!</p>

			 <p>Last week <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> released the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta for Movable Type version 4<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Until last weekend I didn&rsquo;t have the time to have a look at it, but Sunday I downloaded the files and copied them to my server.</p>
<p>Of course things went wrong, as was to be expected with a beta release. I know that you never should install beta releases on a production environment, but I took the risk anyway as this weblog is partly a playing ground. I am a long-time Movable Type user, and suspect that my database is full of legacy data of old settings and plugins.</p>
<p>After copying the files, I went to the new MT Dashboard, and found out that all images had been scrambled. I suspected that my FTP application accidentally had uploaded them in ASCII mode, so copied them again in binary mode, without result. I checked the files I had downloaded from Six Apart, and yes, they were scrambled as well. So I downloaded the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tar.gz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file instead of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zip<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, uploaded the images again, and the images came up correctly.</p>
<p>The second problem I encountered was more serious. The dashboard showed up OK, but whenever I tried to access one of the blogs, I got an error message:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->invalid permissions for author 1 at lib/MT/Author.pm line 337<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This one took a little bit more to solve, but at the end I found out that newly created users don&rsquo;t have this problem. After comparing all settings in the database between my old users and the new user, I found the culprit: In the table &lsquo;mt_permission&rsquo; I found duplicate record for my user ID with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->permision_blog_id = 0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After removing the duplicate records, the error did not appear any more.</p>
<p>Now I am able to get into my blogs, and as you see, write new items. However, as soon as I publish a new entry I get another error message: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fallback Is Required At Lib/mt/util.pm Line 1331<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I haven&rsquo;t solved this error yet, but found out that I can simply rebuild my site to make the entry appear.</p>
<p>As you can see, I also changed the design of the site. I was getting fed up with the previous design, and at the same time wanted to see what new template features came with MT4, so I reset the templates to the new minimalist theme. The coming days I will be studying and tweaking this design to my own tastes, so things might change a little bit.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed already is that the default templates do not use the widget manager, basically because the new sidebar template module offers filtering by template type, giving the possibility to show a different sidebar on different types of pages.</p>
<p>Other things they copied from WordPress are Pages and a file manager (with tagging!!!).</p>
<p>There are still some other things to be fixed, such as activating trackbacks. In the blog&rsquo;s configuration I see that this has been deactivated on a system level, which is not the case. So far I like MT4 a lot. It is fast, pleasant looking and I am happy with new features such as the file manager, entry auto-save and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interactive template errors<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Though my spamfilters, SpamLookup in combination with Akismet, catch really a lot of comment- and trackback spam on this blog, there is still too much spam slipping through. Since I don&rsquo;t have the time to check my site to see whether comment spam has been published, I have changed my configuration to automatically moderate comments and trackbacks on entries older than twee weeks on which no comment has been posted in the previous week.</p>
<p>This allows me to batch-process the moderation queue, while still making sure that comments on active threads still show up immediately.</p>

<p>But the voice is back! Of course I will still occasionally post a nice video, but will also start writing again about technology, travelling and my life in general. As a true <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> adept, I added this commitment to my list of responsibilities (20.000 feet), and started thinking about some projects to undertake to blow new life in this site.</p>

			 <p>If you buy a brand new PC with Windows Vista, you might find a big surprise when Vista does not look the same as the Vista in the showroom.

Depending of the results of this test, certain features of Vista are enabled or disabled to give you the optimal performance.</p>
<p>This is great from a technical point of view, but makes it difficult to know exactly what you are buying. Only at home you will find your Experience index and see what has been disabled.

			 <p>I am on the road again. Today I am traveling from Barcelona to Cyprus, spending over ten hours in airplanes and airports. No distractions, just me, so I could get a lot of job done. I carry a laptop computer, and already wrote some documents, I checked my e-mail and read all interesting news in Google Reader. I am in the ‚Äòflow‚Äô, but will soon have to stop working. My laptop is running out of batteries, and I still have about half the trip to go. I searched in every corner of the airport, but haven&rsquo;t found a single power outlet!</p>
<p>Many travellers nowadays carry laptop computers and other electronic devices, and most of those devices need electricity. Batteries only serve for some hours, so power outlets in airports would be useful to many travellers. I can&rsquo;t imagine the number of productive hours lost each year in Milano alone! Please airports, give us power outlets.</p>

			 <p>A little bit more than one month ago, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I started a new weblog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> called &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; in which I write about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and personal productivity.</p>
<p>Until now I have written 28 posts meaning that I have been able to keep up with my initial schedule of at least one post every two days. I found it easy to find new material, and usually have about 10 posts in he pipeline.</p>
<p>The people have received the new blog very well. I have received 30 comments/trackbacks. Quite some bloggers have found my blog and have reposted or linked to my articles. The most popular post is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my translation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Seah&rsquo;s compact calendar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for 2007 with 2850 unique views. At this moment I am receiving about 200-400 visitors per day.</p>
<p>So far it has been a very positive experience for me. Even though it costs me a little bit more time to write in Spanish, I enjoy using this language and already learned some more. Of course I tell my visitors that I am not a native speaker, and hope they are willing to forgive my errors.</p>

			 <p>Today I published the first entry on a new weblog: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>El Canasto is my first blog in Spanish and has been created for two reasons. The first reason is that I have found very little material in Spanish about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lifehacks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the topics I like to read about. There is clearly something missing in the Spanish weblog spectrum. The second reason is that I really want to improve my Spanish language skills, but don&rsquo;t have the discipline to sit down and study. However, writing about stuff I like might give me the drive to learn more.</p>
<p>To set up El Canasto I used WordPress and the minimalistic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cutline<!-- raw HTML omitted --> theme. I spent some days making sure every word in the template has been translated correctly into Spanish, and have many plans more for optimizing the look &amp; feel of this new site. But for the moment, it is more important to get rolling, so I published a first little entry. My plan is to maintain a higher posting frequency than on this blog or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as I have much material and a lot of ideas for this blog.</p>
<p>For now I would like all my readers to have a look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Canasto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/11/24/two-faces-of.html">Two faces of the Pareto Principle in business</a></h1>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Pareto principle was named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of income in Italy was received by 20% of the Italian population, but the same principle can be found in many other situations.</p>
<p>In most businesses, 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales. And technical departments know that 80% of the problems are caused by only 20% of the clients. This is very interesting information for managers, who can use these numbers to steer their sales and support departments.</p>
<p>But how can we correlate the Pareto numbers for these two departments? Are the 20% that purchase the most the same customers that use most of your organization&rsquo;s resources? Well, experience tells us that this is not the case: there usually are customers buying for huge amounts without ever needing the support department. The two Pareto principle are not correlated, so if we only look at the small group of customers responsible for 80% of the sales, you will find once again that 20% of that group is using 80% of the resources.</p>
<p>As there is no correlation, I can easily divide my customers into four distinct groups:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I put those four groups in a specific order. The first group is worth the most, as they bring in a lot of money at low costs and the fourth group is the most difficult group.</p>
<p>So should you just drop the customers in the fourth group? Of course not, as we are talking about a principle and not a fixed categorization. If you drop group four, and look again at the numbers, you will see that once again 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales and 80% of the resources are used by only 20% of the clients. Customers who were in to top 20% before, not rank lower simple because you have less customers. If I have 100 clients, there are 20 clients in the top 20%, but if I drop 50 of them, the top 20% will be formed by only 10 customers. Of course, if you have to drop customers, because you haven&rsquo;t got enough resources, make sure you drop clients from the fourth group, as the clients in the other three groups are worth more.</p>

			 <p>A while ago I tried out the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Reader<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and haven&rsquo;t looked back at my old <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RSSBandit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ever after. It ran very smoothly since the start, and I just love the &lsquo;River of News&rsquo; view.</p>
<p>But lately the experience has decreased. The last few days Google News feels slow, taking about 2-3 seconds to go from one article to the next one when I press the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->J<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key, which was also noticed by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Scoble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I also noticed that sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t load all my unread items as it did before; after reading about fifty articles, I reach the bottom, while there are still many unread items waiting for me to be read. This is not a big issue, as I can simply press the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to refresh.
The last days I noticed another glitch: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zombie articles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Google Reader tells me &lsquo;Your reading list has no unread items&rsquo;, while at the same time it shows that I have two unread articles from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tech.memeorandum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For me, this is the most irritating glitch, as I have to leave my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->River of News<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to open the specific feed, change my setting to show all articles and go down the list to find the zombie.</p>
<p>Google Reader still is my preferred reader, and I hope they will solve these glitches soon.</p>

<p>Today, I said goodbye to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->music jukebox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the place where for the past two years you could find tasty music. In this age of streaming music and video, there is no need any more to share MP3 files. Sites like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last.fm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandora<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are of greater help for discovering new music you like.</p>
<p>I also removed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jeroensangers.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site. Until now, that page showed an ugly photo of me (is it even possible to have a pretty photo at all?) and some links to my various sites. I am going to rethink the purpose of that site, which will probably contain more dynamic content. Until then, the site is in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stealth mode<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Just like most other weblogs, this site has its ups and downs, and you might have noticed that it has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->down<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lately. I am quite busy at the moment, working parallel at several projects.</p>
<p>The company I work for is preparing for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SIMO<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trade show in Madrid, where we will present the new versions of our products. Though I won&rsquo;t be present at the show (my responsibilities lie outside Spain) I do have a lot of extra work concerning translating and testing the new software.</p>
<p>Then I am working on the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> web site. This weekend we are going to finish the forum functionality and start working on the design. We already did some brainstorming and I am happy that we are all more or less on the same line. Once the design is finished we will start using the first parts of the new site, and gradually transfer more functionality.</p>
<p>Once in a while I also work a little bit on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BryteNet hosting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Little by little the customers are coming in, but as everything is running smoothly and automated, I don&rsquo;t have much work on it.</p>
<p>And finally there is the blogging thing. I am planning on taking it more seriously, using Brain Tags for playing around, and doing the real blogging at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I am rethinking my work flow to crank up the posting frequency &ndash;now once a week&ndash; and have a more diverse range of articles. Furthermore I am working on a new weblog in Spanish about <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->GTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>You see, I have plenty of work, so I better stop writing and get something done!</p>

			 <p>Everybody who knows me a little bit will admit it: I am a lazy person. Because I am so lazy I work in the IT industry, dreaming about automating all those boring tasks. Of course, automating tasks is hard work, but I don&rsquo;t want to think about that.</p>
<p>One of the problems I wanted to automate for a very long time is making backups of my PC. I know that it is very important to backup my files, and usually after tweaking my backup system I backup every X days. But after a while I loose interest, and days become weeks, and weeks become months,‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Media choice is another problem with backups, as the amount of data I have is growing exponentially. Back in the MS-DOS days, all important data fitted on e few floppy disks. As I started my studies and got involved in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jong Nederland<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I produced more documents and changed to ZIP disks for my backup. When I started ripping MP3 files, I was forced to change to CD&rsquo;s and DVD&rsquo;s. And now that I am creating my own video&rsquo;s I need even more than that. I thought about buying a USB hard disk, but the thought of spending a lot of money for a medium that will be outdated within two years kept me from going to the store.</p>
<p>And then I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Carbonite Online Backup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Carbonite is a little application that will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->automatically<!-- raw HTML omitted --> backup my files to a server on the internet, without any user interaction. The best part of Carbonite is its price: $5 per month for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unlimited<!-- raw HTML omitted --> storage!!! So for only $5 per month I can sit back and relax, knowing that my files are safe, and I won&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of space in the future.</p>
<p>I quickly downloaded and installed the demo version (15 days free), which promptly began to upload data. Now there was a little problem, as our broadband connection is ADSL, and the A stands for Asynchronous meaning that you can download at high speeds, but have less bandwidth available for uploading. It took me two days to get all my files to the Carbonite server.</p>
<p>When checking what files were present on the Carbonite server, I noticed that there was a lot of crap. In the installation procedure, I had selected that I wanted to backup <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Documents<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which Carbonite had interpreted as being the whole <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Documents and settings<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder, including cached files, etc. I tweaked the settings a little bit, and was able to reduce the backed up volume by one third. I also added some other files such as my ActiveWords database and my Trillian preferences (both installed under <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Program Files<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the whole system up and running for some weeks now, and am very happy with it. My backups are always up-to-date and I don&rsquo;t have to think about copying files anymore.</p>
<p>The only problem I have found is my mailbox. As I typically have e-mail open during the whole day, the inbox file changes continuously. Besides that, the file is rather big, taking a while to upload. The result is that this particular file is hardly ever backed up. I am still looking for a solution, possibly using another tool to create a local copy and adding this copy to Carbonite.</p>
<p>In short: Carbonite is a very good product giving great value for its money.</p>

<p>We found Cal paller a very special place. The location is fantastic and the 18th century mansion has been restored with great care of detail. There are many little corners where you can sit down and relax. Eva and Pep, the owners of the place, are very caring and the food Eva prepared us for supper was absolutely fabulous.</p>

			 <p>For me the holiday period is not only a period for relaxing, but also a period of reflection. I never make any <!-- raw HTML omitted -->January 1st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> changes to my habits, but usually do so in August or September.</p>
<p>For a while I have been thinking about doing more sports, as most days my physical exercise is limited to the daily walk to the garage to pick up the car. We do occasionally walk in the mountains, but that&rsquo;s not enough. I have been thinking about it for a long time but never found the activity that suited me. My working hours make it difficult to commit to team sports and I don&rsquo;t like the gym as I prefer something in the open air.</p>
<p>This summer it finally occurred me: inline skating could me my thing. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed ice skating in the Netherlands, and like the freedom of making little tours around my hometown. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. Right after coming home I bought myself some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rollerblades<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the Geo II model, and downloaded some braking instructions as I knew that I&rsquo;d had to learn different breaking techniques that I used on ice.</p>
<p>This week I went out skating two times on an empty parking lot. The coming weeks I will go back there to practice my breaking skills before I hit the streets. And you know what the best thing is? I already feel good about myself!</p>

			 <p>One more week to go until the start of our holidays. Yes, we go when everybody else already forgot about their holidays.</p>
<p>Our plans are simple: we are going to spend one week in the Netherlands, and two weeks in Andalusia. We&rsquo;ve tried to visit my family before, but the flights were simply too expensive in the high season. So we decided to use part of our holidays to visit my family and our friends. As we have plenty of time, we will go up by car, saving a few bucks along the way.</p>
<p>After that we plan to spend some days at home to pick up our tent, and drive further down to Andalusia. In the almost five years that I live here, I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of Spain besides Catalonia. Of course there is plenty to see over here, but I feel a little bit ashamed of my lack of knowledge about the other parts of this country. The two weeks we will be spend in the south will be a little start in getting to know more of Spain.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yes, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->43 Folders podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is my favourite <!-- raw HTML omitted -->podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are a few reasons why I consider it my favourite. Besides the obvious reasons such as &ldquo;Merlin Mann is a geek like me&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am obsessed with productivity tools&rdquo; there is another difference between the 43 Folders podcast and 99% of all the other podcasts out there.</p>
<p>Most people listen to podcasts during their daily commute. Modern society forces people to spend a ridiculous amount of time travelling, and there are very few things you can do while driving a car. Most commuters listen to music or the radio, but that is a very unproductive activity. If you want to spend your car-time productively, you only have two options: audio-based learning and listening to podcasts. Long commutes are the perfect place for listening podcast, and most podcasters target their show to this group. The result is that most podcasts are either 30 minutes long or 60 minutes long, so listeners have handy building blocks to fill their car time. 30 minutes also gives the podcasters the possibility to add decoration such as jingles and music to their show, making podcasting more entertaining, but less productive.</p>
<p>My commute usually takes less than 10 minutes, so it makes no sense for me to listen to podcasts in the car. I listen to podcasts during my breakfast instead. I only take a sandwich and a coffee for breakfast, so the maximum podcast length is about 15 minutes. I searched around (why do none of the podcast directories have an advanced search feature where I can filter for podcast length?) and found only very few short podcasts. And out of this very few podcasts that fit my needs, 43 folders is my favourite.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have a love/hate relationship with personal finance. Ever since I have a computer I have been trying to get a grip on finances, with changing results.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My first attempt used the example Excel sheet created by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nibud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that came with Microsoft Excel. It was a nice and clever Excel sheet, but still living with my parents I only used part of it. After a while I stopped entering my receipts, and out went the Excel sheet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A little bit later I started playing with Microsoft Access. Access also comes with a financial example file, and I modified and tweaked it to fit my needs. But after all the hacking, all left to be done was entering receipts and numbers, which is a boring job. I guess I still didn&rsquo;t need personal finance, as I left the database alone after some months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some time later, a new phenomenon showed up: internet banking. My bank sent me some diskettes with an application that was able to import bank statements. Now that was easy! At first I tried to manage cash money with that application as well, but soon left that again. Internet banking was a success, as I have managed my bank accounts through that application until I could access my accounts through web pages. When later I started buying and selling stocks and stock options I could do that from the same application. That little application gave an overview of my bank accounts, but I still haven&rsquo;t been able to see where the money was going‚Ä¶</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The situation complicated when I started living together. I was not dealing with my money anymore, it was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our<!-- raw HTML omitted --> money. After some months the question came up: &ldquo;Where does our money go?&rdquo; We talked about it, and decided to implement a low-tech financial planning solution: pen &amp; paper. This worked great for some months, until we had more or less a picture of our expenses. Exit pen &amp; paper.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last year we were planning some big expenses, and I wanted to know whether these were justified, and how much time we would need to recover the invested money. Right about that time I read about an easy budgeting template in Excel, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pear Budget<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I downloaded it, sat down half an hour to fix the categories and the budgets, and have used it ever after. It is easy and fast to maintain, gives a good overview of our spendings. However, lately I had the feeling that I wanted more. Pear Budget shows me where the money is coming from and where it is going, but does not show what we have, and what we are expecting to have in the future. Besides that I wanted to make some changes in the categories I had set up last year, and that would mess up all past numbers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I started to look around for a more complete solution, that could offer me budgeting, but also import bank statements, manage investments, work in several currencies, schedule payments, ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I thought a moment about searching for a Web 2.0 solution, but quickly let go that idea as I wouldn&rsquo;t trust such a personal information to anybody. I looked at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microsoft Money Premium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but that seems a very US centred product, and is overly complex; I do not need my personal finance application to do tax statements.</p>
<p>After a little but more of searching, I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AceMoney<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a cheap but very complete solution that seems to fit my current needs. The user interface is not as shiny as MS Money, but it certainly does the job. Furthermore, AceMoney has been translated into many languages and even loads the local list of banks and categories.</p>

			 <p>As of version 3.31, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> natively supports tags.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are keywords or descriptive terms associated with an item as means of classification. Unlike categories, an item can have many tags to describe the item in several ways. Tags are well known from other (web) applications such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for tagging photos and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->del.icio.us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for tagging links.</p>
<p>The well known weblog search service <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technorati<!-- raw HTML omitted --> introduced tags to weblog entries, and allows for browsing and searching texts on weblogs by tag. Blog entries can be tagged easily by simply placing a few links at the bottom of the entry in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the right format<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[tagname]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> also supports tags, I hoped for a fluent integration with Technorati. Even though the default MT templates do not link the tags shown on the pages to Technorati but rather to an internal tags search on the current weblog, I hoped for a standard implementation in the RSS feed templates spidered by Technorati. And indeed I found a correct looking code:</p>
<p>Technorati automatically converts categories in the RSS feed to tags, and even though MT defines a new namespace, it should work correctly‚Ä¶ But unfortunately, the above code does not add the tag called &ldquo;technorati&rdquo; to the item, but rather the record number &ldquo;31&rdquo;.
When I tried to look up the specification at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag">http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I received a 404, so I still don&rsquo;t know whether Six Apart made a mistake when developing the new feed template or whether Technorati should have parsed the feed. Does anybody know whether either Six Apart of Technorati are working on this issue?</p>

			 <p>One of the biggest problems in scripting and programming is escaping quotes. Quotes have a special meaning, they are usually used for specifying the start and end of a string, such as in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><code>&lt;abbr title=&quot;eXtensible Markup Language&quot;&gt;</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But what happens when the string between the quotes also contains quotes? ‚Ä¶Errors!</p>
<p>There are several ways to prevent this situation. The two most common solutions are escaping the quotes by placing a special symbol in front of it such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and replacing the quote by its character entity reference <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;quote;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Why am I telling this? Well, this morning I was looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technorati<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s Favorites function, and noticed that something went wrong. When adding a site to your favorites, you have the posibility to attach tags to that site. The instructions for adding tags are clear:</p>

<p>The following happened:<br>

<p>Technorati obviously tried to solve the quoting problem by replacing the quotes, but this change has a nasty side effect. Of course I have contacted Technorati about this issue, and will update this post when they reply.</p>

			 <p>After the succesful redesign of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I had gathered some momentum, and continued with the redesign of Brain Tags.</p>
<p>First of all, I reverted back to the basic Movable Type templates, as I had hacked the old templates to a level that made it very difficult to maintain and update. Actually, the latest update to version 3.31 broke my site at several parts.</p>
<p>When all templates were more or lass back to basic, I used the fantastic StyleCatcher plugin to change the look and feel. I selected a style called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make my way<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the Movable Type style contest. I know it is not very original, as there mioght be dozens of other blogs using the same style, but it is far better than I ever could make.</p>
<p>This is where it stands now. I still have some minor issues to fix, which will probably be done next week. What do you think about the new Brain Tags?</p>

			 <p>Since June 2004 I have posted 953 links to interesting, new and funny sites in the Brain Links section of this site. Today I have decided that I will stop adding more links.</p>
<p>I noticed the last months that little by little I am adding less links, and I started to wonder why. I started collecting the Brain Links as a reference site for myself; a place where I could look up those handy sites I saw a month ago. But the reality is that nowadays I hardly look back at all those links. It has literally become a link dump, a black hole for interesting stuff. I guess that subconciously I already figured out that it is not worth the effort anymore.</p>
<p>So exit to Brain Links. Soon I will start remodelling the Brain Tags site, just as I have done with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wizard of POS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will probably result in a leaner site that is easier to maintain and update. At that point, the Brain Links will probably disappear completely, though I know that you should not break links..</p>

<p>It has been very quiet on this site, and that usually means that I am working on something. And indeed, I am working on the new site for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Besides that, the temperature in Lleida, almost reaching 40 ¬∞, makes that I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time behind the PC, but rather stay in the water of the swimming pool. As you might be worried what is going on here, I deceided to write a little bit about the new fimcap site.</p>
<p>We decided to implement the new site using the eZ Publish CMS, which allows for multi-lingual content and custom defined content types. This flexibility of course has a price: a steep learning curve. The basics are quite simple, but problems start when you want to modify templates. You literally can control everything, but you have to find the right template. Each page is made up from dozens of little templates, each of which can reside in several places.</p>
<p>Let me explain that in more detail. If you do a fresh installation, your site is configured to use two sets of templates: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->standard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which contains some bare-bones unstyled templates that make sure eZ Publish outputs at least something, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->base<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which adds a little bit of style. Of course, for your own site you want to use your own design, and you can either replace the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->base<!-- raw HTML omitted --> design, or add your own design, which is what we did. Now every time a template is called, eZ Publish first looks in the Fimcap design. If it can&rsquo;t find a template, it will search in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->base<!-- raw HTML omitted --> design, and finally it will fall back to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->standard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> design. So if I want to modify a template, I have to search in that order as well to find the currently used template. After a working for some weeks with the template system, I finally got the hang of it, and am able to find the correct templates quickly‚Ä¶</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re interested in the progress we&rsquo;re making, have a look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new.fimcap.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>FC Barcelona is champion of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚ÄòLiga<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô. If you know me only a little bit, you know that I couldn&rsquo;t care less, right? I only like sports the moment I practice it myself, but do not care about what others are doing. I like playing soccer with friends, though I am a terrible player, but get really bored when looking soccer on the television, to the point that I usually fall asleep.</p>
<p>But when FC Barcelona is involved, I have no choice. Living ‚Äòonly‚Äô 160 kilometers from Barcelona means that Bar√ßa is part of daily life. It is as simple as that, and there is no way around it! Each and every day they appear on the TV news, whether they are preparing for a big match or simply because the players went for a walk.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening hell broke loose in Lleida. After the match everybody went out on the streets to celebrate the victory. There were fireworks, drums, people shouting and singing, but most of all car horns. The streets in the center had collapsed of all the cars driving around like crazy with Bar√ßa flags out of the windows.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind what Bar√ßa does, but I always appreciate a good party!</p>

<p>When we were close to Andorra this weekend, we hopped over the border to do some shopping. We were looking for a new digital camera, and finally bought the Pentax A10. Of all cameras that matched our requirements, small form factor, minimal 3x optical zoom, quality optics system, the Pentax was the only one offering a usefull additional feature: stabilisation. The problem with small cameras is that it is very difficult to hold it steady, especially when using the zoom function. Stabilisation makes sure that pictures are still sharp under these conditions.</p>
<p>The coming days I will try out our new camera, so you might expect some changes on my photo page again.</p>

			 <p>I have been playing a little bit more with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eZ Publish<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BryteNet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site. One little disappointment was that I could not generate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->friendly URIs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://brytenet.com/forum/">http://brytenet.com/forum/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I have to work with URIs as <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://brytenet.com/index.php?/forum/">http://brytenet.com/index.php?/forum/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. According to the eZ people this is because BryteNet has set up PHP as a CGI process and not through Apache&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mod_php<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which understands the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->accept_path_info<!-- raw HTML omitted --> function. The Brytenet servers implemented PHP as a CGI process for security reasons, and there is no way to change this in an easy way. I still don&rsquo;t understand why this is such a problem, as other PHP applications such as WordPress are able to produce friendly URIs.</p>
<p>Anyway, maintaining a site&rsquo;s content with eZ Publish is very easy. I have been able to set up the whole content structure in no-time, and even made some changes to the default templates. Templating is more daunting, as the template language used is very, very complete. For the moment I have only made some small changes, and have concentrated myself on the actual contents of the site.</p>
<p>Today I also created a Dutch version of the BryteNet site, which was done within 5 minutes! Now I am translating all content, which is done in a very clever way. A single object (text, folder, image,‚Ä¶) can have several translations, and depending on the way you access this object, one version or the other is shown. So going to <a href="http://brytenet.com">http://brytenet.com</a> gives me the default (English) view of the home page, while <a href="http://nl.brytenet.com">http://nl.brytenet.com</a> will show me the Dutch view of the same object. Very neat! I still have to translate the FAQ section, which for the moment will show the default language, even if I request the Dutch view.</p>
<p>When all has been translated into Dutch, I will add Spanish and Catalan too. And probably about the same time I will start tweaking my templates to change the components shown and the layout of the pages. The nicest job, making a unique design for this site, I will keep for the last, as it is the most logical order, and to have something to work to.</p>

			 <p>It has been some time ago since I last posted, so I thought I needed to spend some minutes to explain what is happening.</p>
<p>As usually when a site does not get updated anymore, I was simply too busy. First of all, I have been traveling. And in my case, travelling usually means working many hours (yes, I considder a diner with my client ‚Äòworking‚Äô) and a lack of Internet connections. This time my hotel did have two PC&rsquo;s in the lobby which I used occasionally, but I would have preferred an affordable (free?) WiFi connection in my room.</p>

			 <p>I have been looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Personalized Homepage<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->GPH<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) before, but quickly decided that it has no additional use for me.</p>
<p>GPH offers you the possibility to add content (RSS feeds) to the Google Search home page, which is fine if you only use three or four news sources to stay up-to-date. But if you use several more news sources, you probably already use a feed aggregator to read them, and don&rsquo;t need the GPH.</p>
<p>I did like the idea of seeing the weather forecast on the homepage, but unfortunately neither Lleida nor Harmelen are available in the configuration of this widget. Microsoft does this better on their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Start.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> portal, since it does have information for Lleida, and correctly recognizes Harmelen to insert the weather forecast for Utrecht.</p>
<p>Today Google <!-- raw HTML omitted -->published an API<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for GPH, which hopefully will set a lot of creative programmers to work. At this moment I am only interested in two widgets: a better weather widget and an e-mail linked to my normal POP3 or IMAP mail, since I normally don&rsquo;t use GMail.</p>

One copy resides on my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Palm Zire<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 31 which I always take with me, and the other list is my Outlook contacts folder on my Office PC. My address list is growing every day, and each time it costs me more to maintain it.</p>
<p>Looking up addresses is fast. The search function on my Palm and the excellent LookOut plug-in for Outlook are very fast. But updating information cost more. I regularly receive address changes from companies of friends. And if it is a big company I might have dozens of entries for it in my address list, which I have to update one by one. The same happens for friends and family. I usually have two entries for each ‚Äòcouple‚Äô, so I can store birth dates and mobile phone numbers. But they share the same address and home phone.</p>
<p>My ideal PIM application would store ‚Äòcontacts‚Äô in two separate but linked tables: an address and a person. If I change the address, it will change for all persons within that address. Yes, that would be great!</p>

			 <p>Here is something not many people know: an open application window consumes more memory than a minimized window. You can use that in your benefit: if you have a lot of memory in your PC, you might want to keep all windows open to be able to switch faster between applications. On the other hand, if you work on a PC with little memory, it is better to keep as many windows minimized as possible to free memory for the current application.</p>

			 <p>I just noticed that I have published exactly 499 entries on Brain Tags. Time to add number 500!!!</p>
<p>So this is number 500, a milestone. Not that it has been difficult to write that much articles, since it took me almost eight years (I wrote the first entry on November 24, 1997). Of course I didn&rsquo;t start writing regularly until I moved to Spain in 2001, when I had written only 27 entries in four years. You can follow my writing progress on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Entries &amp; Comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am still going strong, and still enjoy writing. So much that I am not only writing on Brain Tags, but also write on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->POS blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a Small Place<!-- raw HTML omitted --> business weblog of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BryteNet hosting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s continue talking about feed reading. Last week I described the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->five phases of feed reading<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I had observed. Or actually the first four phases are observations, while the fifth phase is purely speculation.</p>
<p>And exactly this fifth phase was the part I received the most feedback on. I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->somebody agreeing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with this tabloid view. I also received this e-mail from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Scoble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have to admit that I did not think a lot about the fifth phase when I wrote it down. It was simple the first idea that came to my mind, and I jotted it down. Raw blogging‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But after reading the reactions, I thought it oer again. What exactly do I expect? How would I like to receive my news?</p>
<p>The tabloid model and Memeorandum do a nice job in selecting, but there is one thing neither of them covers: they are both excellent in selecting the top stories which everybody likes, but fail to select the top stories <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like. There is no personalisation, and feed reading has everything to do with a personal experience.</p>
<p>What we really need is ‚Äòclever‚Äô feed readers, applications that know what I like and what I am not interested in.</p>
<p>My first idea is to use a Bayesian filter, which is already succesfully used to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->identify spam<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->route helpdesk requests<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on a big set of RSS feeds and have it select the most interesting items. I rarely have very original ideas, and there are many people spending more time on feed readers, so somebody must already have had the same idea, and maybe even already worked it out. A little bit of searching lead me to 0xDECAFBAD, who tried it out and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->found that it did not work so well<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I know that the idea is still new, and that this is just one test conducted by one person, but it is clear that more work has to be done in this field. For now I start playing with the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TailRank<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service, which partly solves my problem according to all those people who have written about it the last days.</p>

<p>Inspired by Jason Kottke, I entered phase 4 today. I regrouped all my feeds, and reduced the number of feeds in Bloglines.

			 <p>I just received a cheque from Google. They pay whenever I pass $100, which in my case takes a while. But everytime the cheque arrives it is a happy moment.</p>
<p>The arrival of my cheque also triggered a chain of thoughts about advertising on my site. A little bit more than a year ago, I added the Google AdWords to this site. I simply took the existing pages, and looked where I could fit in the AdWords box. Since it was a test, I didn&rsquo;t spent too much time tweaking my templates; I just wanted to know whether it worked. In the past year I have made some minor changes, mainly to try out the AdWords program.</p>
<p>As I said, I had some thoughts about this whole advertising thing. One of these thoughts is that I should rethink the design of my pages so that the advertisements blend in better. If I take advertising seriously, I should also give the ads a better position on my pages (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->above the fold<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) of course without taking too much away from the content.</p>
<p>I also want to try out Chitika, which I heard gives good results as well. I placed some Chitika adds on my site, like the one above, and will monitor it during the next weeks. As you see, Chitika&rsquo;s eMiniMalls look far more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sexy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than Google&rsquo;s AdWords. But are they also more effective?</p>

			 <p>The past 48 hours I have been diving around in our brand new Toyota Corolla Verso, and I feel the King of the road. That feeling mainly comes because this car makes a lot more noise than our previous, old, car, and because it is so much higher. I can look over the cars in front of me, and see much more when I am passing dangerous crossing. In short, I feel more in control, and that is worth a lot when driving in a chaotic Catalan city.</p>
<p>This weekend we&rsquo;re going to make some more kilometres to try out the 6th gear and the cruise control.</p>

			 <p>I feel good!</p>
<p>We just came back from a week&rsquo;s holiday in the Netherlands. The aim of our holiday was to relax, and we succeeded. Instead of running from one ‚Äòobligatory‚Äô visit to another, as we usually do when visiting my home country, this time we put the emphasis on what we want. This visit to the Netherlands has been touristic than any previous visit, and we loved every minute of it.</p>
<p>Of course the fantastic weather helped a lot; it was sunny every day so we could spend a lot of time outside in nature and on the terrace. We visited amongst others Amsterdam, Utrecht, &rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch, Zeist, Amelisweerd, Lelystad, and Enkhuizen.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re back in ‚Äòreal‚Äô life we are already looking forward to our next visit at Christmas time!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a small place<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a new blog I created today. You might be wondering why I am starting a new blog while I even haven&rsquo;t got the time to update Brain tags regularly! The truth is that I am blogging just as much as always, but I spread my writings over several sites to prevent clutter.</p>
<p>If you are interested in my personal life and general writings about technology and travelling, Brain Tags is the place to be.</p>
<p>And if you are interested in news and my opinion about the Point of Sale market, I give you the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->POS Blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And now I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a small place<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, giving you a view behind the curtains of a small part-time hosting company.</p>
<p>I have started writing about what I did to set it all up, with todays article telling on how I got the idea to start a hosting business. Of course, Brain Tags readers already know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the answer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I included it for completeness.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a small place<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is also the first site I created in WordPress. For the moment the set-up is very basic (I only changed the default templates) but you can expect some more tinkering in the coming weeks. So far I have been impressed by WordPress: the installation was peanuts, and there is plenty of functionality. The user interface is not as sleek as the Movable Type interface, but I value function over looks anyway.</p>

			 <p>Street theatre is nice, since it is small-scale and personal. The acts are small, and the audience is small. That&rsquo;s why they got out of the theatre, and onto the street. That&rsquo;s why it is called street theatre. A great way to get to know street theatre is to visit a theatre festival. Edinburgh has the most famous theatre festival in the world, and T√†rrega has the most famous Spanish festival. T√†rrega happens to be quite close to Lleida, so tonight we&rsquo;ll be walking around in the streets of T√†rrega to see what is happening in the marvellous world of street theatre.</p>
<p>This year we found something curious. There was one show we really liked to see (Toni Alba), but this show is performed in a theatre. The curious thing is that we are going to look at a street theatre artist, those artists that are too small for a theatre, that is so popular that he&rsquo;s playing in a theatre. The other curious thing about this show is that it starts at 1:00 o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>

<p>The street where I live is just inside the ‚Äòblue zone‚Äô, the zone where you have to pay to park on the streets. The payment machines are activated on working days from 9-14 and 16-20, the other hours you don&rsquo;t have to pay.</p>
<p>I never pay, since these hours coincide more or less with my working hours, so I can park my car in front of our door for free. The only exception is the end of the morning: I work until 13:30, and usually arrive home 15 minutes later. So officially I have to pay 15 minutes, 15 eurocent, every day, which I never did until today.</p>
<p>When I come home I always pass the parking control, as they are talking to each other while waiting for the end of their shift. Every day I see them standing on the same corner, and I know that I can park the car in the blue zone without having to be afraid that they will fine me.</p>
<p>The controller on the photo might just have started this job and was simply doing his job, or she does not get along very well with her colleagues or maybe simply had a bad day and wanted to share this feeling ;-).</p>
<p>Anyway, the result was that I ended up paying for 5 minutes of parking to avoid problems.</p>

			 <p>We all know that almost all comment spam is coming from virus infected PC&rsquo;s turned into zombies. For a while I suspected that these zombies work with a list of URIs to attack, since attacks always follow the same pattern: suddenly I receive a lot of comments from various IP addresses, but all using the same referrer and posting more or less the same message. Usually attacks take about two days before the comment spam slows down. Very few of all these comments make it through the Movable Type spam filters, and usually adding the URL to the blacklist takes care of them forever.</p>
<p>Since upgrading to version 3.2 I did not receive any single comment spam. The reason is that I forgot to rename the comment script. One of the first measures I took against comment spam was renaming this script, so bots using Google to find spammable sites would not find me. With the latest update, I forgot to do so. Now, the list with spammable URIs these spambots use, contain hundreds of links to a script that does not exist anymore. So they do not even reach my comment-spam filters!</p>
<p>Even better, they fall into another trap. I catch all request for ‚Äòinapropiate‚Äô files as system files and non-existing scripts (formmail.pl), and automatically put their IP address on a blacklist, which is cleaned up after two weeks. This blacklist has been growing like crazy the last week, due to all these MT-spammers requesting the old location.</p>
<p>Until they refresh their list, I can sit back and relax!</p>

			 <p>After I left Harmelen four years ago, I also stopped participating in youth activities. Of course I have done some work for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as their webmaster, but I never visited or participated in any activity.</p>
<p>Last weekend we went to Vall d&rsquo;Aran to spend 24 hours in a Roundabout camp.</p>
<p>Roundabout is a Fimcap project in which two groups from different countries spend their summer camp together. This Roundabout was between three groups (Germany, Malta and Catalonia), and this was the third year of the project. Since we knew the Maltese animators and most of the German animators very well, we visited them to meet our old friends again.</p>
<p>Because the group had been together for already a week and the participants knew each other from former years, we decided to stay on the background to not disturb the group dynamics. That gave us many possibilities to analyse the activity, and compare it to our own experiences. People active within a youth organisation already know that there are huge differences between groups within a single organisation, let alone the differences between different organisations from different countries ‚Äî this is one reason Fimcap is so interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, the atmosphere was very relaxed, and everybody was enjoying the activity. And we? We were very happy to meet our old friends again, and get up-to-date with all the gossip.</p>

			 <p>I just read &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to tip properly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; on lifehacker, and was very surprised to read about pre-tipping:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What a huge bullshit!!! Why did we let it go this far?!</p>
<p>First of all, tipping is a way to express my thanks for the delivered services. If I decide to pay a little bit extra, I decide how much I will give. In many places I read tipping rules like ‚Äúyou should always give 10%‚Äù, but for me there is only one rule: how do I value the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service delivered to me. I put emphasis on extra, since I always assume that normal service is already included in the price. I pay for a coffee, and you bring it. If I read in the quote above that I have to pre-tip in order to encourage the waiter to respond promptly to my needs, I&rsquo;d rather go to another place, since this waiter is simply not doing his job! He should be paid less, not more!</p>
<p>Furthermore, why do we only tip in bars and restaurants? Don&rsquo;t the hairdresser and the cashier of the supermarket work just as much or even more? And who ever gave a tip to the electric co.? OK, skip that last one, since they will never do something extra for me.</p>
<p>The point is, I see tipping as something general. If you do something extra for me, I pay you extra. If you deliver the basic service, e.g. you bring me my cup of coffee when I order one, I pay only the required amount. A tip is something you need to earn!</p>

			 <p>To make dreams come true you need two things: focus and time. Without focus a project takes way too much time, and without time‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyway, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had a dream<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I wanted to come true. With some spare time in the weekend and in the lunch breaks, which are 2¬Ω hours here, the second factor was available. I struggled a little bit more with the first factor, since I tend to jump from database design to logo design to testing out e-mail automation. But I managed to stick to my plan:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Everything is fully operational, but it has a horrible design. I hope to fix all that this week, take my summer holidays and open the site on August 1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the shepherd‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?‚Äù</p>
<p>The shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully-grazing flock and calmly answered, ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p>
<p>The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his IBM Thinkpad and connected it to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas. He sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a response. Finally, he prints out a 130 page report on his miniaturized printer then turns to the shepherd and says‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou have exactly 1586 sheep.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat is correct; take one of the sheep.‚Äùsaid the shepherd.</p>
<p>He watches the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his car. Then the shepherd says: ‚ÄúIf I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my animal?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOK, why not.‚Äù answered the young man.</p>
<p>‚ÄúClearly, you are a consultant.‚Äù said the shepherd.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat&rsquo;s correct.‚Äù says the yuppie, ‚Äúbut how did you guess that?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo guessing required.‚Äù answers the shepherd. ‚ÄúYou turned up here although nobody called you. You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and you don&rsquo;t know crap about my business‚Ä¶ Now give me back my dog.‚Äù</p>

			 <p>Our car is about to reach 300.000 km, and the bills of the garage tell us that it is time to say goodbye to our Fiat Punto and start looking for something else.</p>
<p>The first question,new or second hand?, was quickly answered; as the second hand market is almost inexistent here in Spain. Everybody buys new and keeps driving it until the car reaches the same stage as our current car. We will probably end up buying a new car, unless we are lucky enough to buy a showroom model.</p>
<p>The second question, what kind of car?, was also easily answered: we live in the city centre, so big cars are out of the question. And considered my length and the fact that we regularly use the car to go away with our friends, really small cars are also not suited for us. So that leaves us with the regular tourist cars and MPVs.</p>
<p>Since every brand offers these models, we made up a list of all dealers in Lleida and started to visit them last Saturday. Unfortunately, almost all of them were closed, since the day before was a bank holiday! In the end we managed to visit the dealers for Peugeot and Renault, and came home with a lot of information about these cars.</p>
<p>We also bought some magazines with the typical list of all brands and models in the back, and while browsing all that information I quickly noticed that I simply had way too much information. I need a way to get rid of all surplus of information, I won&rsquo;t buy a Ferrari and don&rsquo;t have the slightest idea whether 150 Nm is OK or not, so fired up Google to search for the table in the car magazines in text or Excel format to play with.</p>
<p>Without success. It seems like all the car sites have been made only for car-enthusiasts. Usually the first selection you have to make is the brand and the model, which is exactly the information I want the site to give me! I am very disappointed in what I found.</p>
<p>When I am looking for a mobile phone of ‚Ç¨50, I have hundreds of sites to help me, but when I am making one of the biggest purchases of my life, I fall into the hands of the salesmen without any help from the Internet.</p>

			 <p>The temperature is slowly rising to a level where there are only two places to stay: inside an air-conditioned office or on the beach. This weekend I choose the latter, resulting in a lot of time to dream‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I thought about this site, and how I am only using a fraction of the available disk space and bandwidth.</p>
<p>What a waste! What if I just sold the space and bandwidth I am not using? Should be easy enough, I already us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cPanel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to manage the site, and I know that an additional script called WebHost Manager is available in which I can create new users and assign hosting packages. I could easily implement this without any additional cost.</p>
<p>What else should I need? A way to receive payments.‚Ä¶ Most hosting providers I dealt with use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2CheckOut<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to receive credit card payments, and I could open a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paypal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account as well. Both payment services take a percentage of the sales amount, both come without any set-up costs or monthly charges, so that&rsquo;s free of risk.</p>
<p>What else? I need to communicate with my clients. Some kind of helpdesk software, which also manages the client&rsquo;s orders and invoices and which can be linked to the two services above to cash in and preferably to WHM so accounts are generated automatically, after all, I rather spend my time on the beach.</p>
<p>There are some very good and complex packages available, but at this moment I am still dreaming, so I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much money, and certainly don&rsquo;t want to pay monthly charges. Google found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->phpCoin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which looks like it could be a good <!-- raw HTML omitted -->face<!-- raw HTML omitted --> towards my clients.</p>
<p>Mmmm, sounds like I could do it. Of course I have to spend some more time on the beach to think about details as the composition of the hosting packages I am going to offer and the name of my little hosting company (I already have some ideasj, and after that I need even more hours to implement all this and make a stunning design for the site. Will this dream ever come true???</p>

			 <p>A trend I noticed on my sites lately: referrer spam is dying out, trackback spam is the main focus of spammers. This makes sense, since most sites only have one page showing their referrer statistics, if shown at all, while they usually accept trackback pings on every page.</p>

			 <p>Most computers have two input devices: a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse is mainly used to navigate in the GUI, while the keyboard is used to enter data. Both input devices need some training to get used to, though I still picture my father picking up the mouse from the table and moving it through the air.</p>
<p>Experienced mouse users are ably to move the pointer from one side of the screen to the other side to click on a tiny button within a fraction of a second, which is becoming increasingly difficult as the screen resolutions get bigger. Besides moving and aiming the pointer, they know how to use the three buttons and the scroll wheel at the right moment. Advanced mouse users sometimes use mouse-gesture enabled applications to perform even more functions with the mouse.</p>
<p>Experienced keyboard users are able to reach high key rates using all ten fingers. Besides high speed data entry, they also use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CTRL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ALT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> keys to navigate through applications.</p>
<p>I rarely meet persons who have reached the highest levels in using both devices. Mouse‚Äìwizards usually type with two (or three or four) fingers, while keyboard enthusiast loose time navigating. The problem is that we do not have enough hands. Efficient use of both devices requires three hands: two for the keyboard and on for the mouse. Depending on the type of work done mostly frequently, people become either mouse‚Äìaddicted or keyboard‚Äìbound.</p>
<p>In my work, I receive many interrupts and rarely work more than five minutes in the same application. As a result, my primary input device is the mouse. In the past I have tried to learn to type with ten fingers on the old mechanical typewriter of my mother, but due to my mouse use I have fallen back to a two finger system.</p>
<p>But things are changing. As my work slowly shifts from technical support to marketing and sales, I find myself writing more texts. And the more I write, the more I feel limited by my two‚Äìfinger technique. I write slow and make many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->mistakes. So I decided to use the mouse less and improve my typing skills, preferably using all ten fingers. I am aware that this is going to be very difficult, since old habits are hard to shake off and starting to write with ten fingers will initially decrease my typing speed even more, but I am convinced that I will be more efficient in the long term.</p>
<p>I do not have time to do a special training, but would rather learn it be gradually changing my habits. And of course a gadget freak like me needs some tools to help me. So the first step I took was to install <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ActiveWords<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my computer. ActiveWords is a wonderful application in which you configure words to trigger events. To open the Firefox browser, I simply type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and my favourite browser starts. The trick for me is that ActiveWords lets me start applications faster by keyboard than by mouse, even if I use ten fingers to type. Another benefit of ActiveWords is that the Misspellings plug-in corrects my mistypings within any application! It works exactly like the auto correct feature of Microsoft Word, but is works system wide. I have been using ActiveWords for some days now, and even though I sometimes enter the keywords with only two fingers, I am very happy about it.</p>
<p>Another tool which I am planning to use more is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emacs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the amazing extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor. Emacs interests me for its huge range of features, which all can be controlled by keyboard. In the past I have met some Emacs-wizards who were able to write and edit very efficiently and I have used it a little bit in my UNIX days. I am aware that Emacs has a steep learning curve but it looks like a long-term winner for me.</p>

			 <p>Why is it so difficult to do? When I buy a phone, I want <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> functions to work. Since yesterday I am using my new phone that came with the new contract. Since this phone has a camera, I would like to take pictures and send them to my friends or publish them on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Well, that is not possible, since I do not have GPRS. Last year I had exactly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the same problem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with Movistar, but that solved itself after a while. But now I want to send my photos, so I checked the Amena site for instructions. Without success. So tonight I will try out the support department. And when I speak to them I can also activate roaming, since they have decided to deactivate it by default since most people never leave the country anyway ;-).</p>

			 <p>People are individualists; we prefer to do things alone and don&rsquo;t care about the others. Fortunately, we are also ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô and realise that we need other people in certain situations. But if this is not strictly necessary, we are selfish. This is a big pity, since we can do so much more when we co-operate!</p>
<p>I was realising this when I was waiting at the luggage belt of the airport. As usual, everybody was bending over the belt to see whether his or her luggage was coming and thereby blocking the view of the people behind him or her, who in their turn had to bend even more over the belt to see something. In this struggle, only the first person is able to see the luggage coming, and is able to get the luggage without problems. All others have two problems: they cannot see their luggage coming, and when they finally see their property, they are not able to get it because of all the people blocking the way. The solution is very simple: if everybody keeps 2 meters distance from the belt, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everybody<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is able to see their luggage coming, and everybody is able to get to the belt to pick up their suitcase. If it is that simple, why won&rsquo;t people do this? Well, mainly because there is no incentive for the first person that has the view and the space no matter the distance to the belt. And when the first person chooses to stay close to the belt, all the others have only one solution: get even closer to the belt!</p>
<p>In my work I encounter the same problem. Whenever I have contact with a possible dealer in a new country, the word <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exclusivity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> falls within the first two conversations. They have seen our product and think it is good and have the idea that they can conquer the whole market because they have a better product. They are so wrong. Dominating a market is extremely difficult and usually does not depend much on the quality of the product (Microsoft?). If you want to sell a lot of our product, all you need is demand, which is difficult to create. The best way to do it is to have many, many dealers. If many dealers are offering this product, it will become visible. And when it is visible, clients start asking for it. This is how we work in the Spanish market. There are 400+ dealers of our product, and in some branches our product has become the ‚Äòde facto‚Äô standard. Local dealers sell a lot more because there are many other dealers offering the same products; they would never have reached those sales using an exclusive product. If only our foreign contacts could have this insight and allow for more competition in their markets. I am 100% sure that they would sell a lot more!</p>
<p>If people would be less individualistic, we could do bigger things!</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s trade show time! The coming weeks I will present our products in two trade shows in Germany. Note to self: start practising German.</p>
<p>The first show is the EuroShop in D√ºsseldorf. Though this show is aimed at end-users, I will go to support our German distributor. We will share the stand with some hardware companies. At the moment I am working vary hard to make leaflets for fashion shops, shoe shops, perfume shops, supermarkets,‚Ä¶ Besides that I am double checking the quality of our German software and arranging a thousand of small things.</p>
<p>I will be in hall 6, stand G30. If you&rsquo;re in the neighbourhood, just drop by and I will show you our products in person.</p>
<p>The CeBIT is a show from which we expect a lot. There are many potential dealers walking around, who might know us from last year. As this is the second year we have a stand on the CeBIT, we are better prepared than last time. I can assure that the posters won&rsquo;t fall from the wall every 15 minutes this year :-D</p>
<p>After my return from the EuroShop I will start working full time for the CeBIT.
Our stand at the CeBIT is located in hall 1, stand 6i14.</p>

			 <p>Referrer spam on this site is increasing daily. Until now I use a two-step method to block them, even though I don&rsquo;t publish my referrers. First of all, I maintain a list of used domain names. I check my referrers every day, and add newly found domains to the list. If a visitor uses one of these domains as referrer, the request is automatically blocked, and the IP address of the visitor is automagically put on a second list, making sure that future visits will be blocked as well. IP addresses stay on the list for one month, to make sure the size of the list does not get out of hand.</p>
<p>I noticed that the domains on my list are all mentioned in the MT-Blacklist. So those referrer spammers are also comment spammers. MT-Blacklist is updated automatically from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clearinghouse<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so needs less maintenance. It would be nice to be able to combine the two methods right?</p>
<p>Today I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->derefspam.pl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a script to use the MT-Blacklist to remove referrer spam from your server log files. At first thought I wanted to install it, but then I realized that all this script does is throw away information, so it won&rsquo;t pollute your statistics. Since I want to be able to see what really happened on my server, I prefer not to throw away this information. After all, these requests have consumed some bandwidth‚Ä¶ A thought was to implement a script for each request, but I am sure that this will slow down my site too much, since database requests take time‚Ä¶ For the moment I stick with my two lists, and hope that spamming will decrease soon.</p>

			 <p>For people who don&rsquo;t know where Lleida is: it lies about 160 km south-west of Barcelona, in the centre of the Segre valley, surrounded by hills. These hills make that Lleida usually is free of wind, which has great influence on the weather in Lleida.</p>
<p>In summer, the lack of wind makes it 5-10¬∞C hotter than e.g. Barcelona, with weeks of 40¬∞C. The inhabitants prefer to spend their free time in the nearby pyrenees or beaches, which have a more pleasant temperature. As a result, Lleida turns into an empty ghost town in summer.</p>
<p>In winter, the lack of wind together with the lower temperatures create a dense fog, which stays for many days. At this moment we haven&rsquo;t seen a single ray of sun during almost two weeks. The frustrating of the fog is that is is very local. 20km outside of Lleida, in any direction, the sun is shining each day, and the temperature is 15-20¬∞ higher! Every day the news shows a clear wheather map, with one small white dot about 160 km south-west of Barcelona. :-(</p>
<p>We desperately want a little bit of wind, which will blow away the fog and show us that the sun still exists. If not, we will leave town in the weekend to get some sun and leave Lleida as a ghost town just like in summer.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow will be the day that many Dutch blogs will show the special action page. The list of participating bloggers is getting bigger and bigger, and includes some prominent bloggers. You can read all about it on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->action page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Today I received the instructions, which consist of simply replacing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->index.html<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page with the action page. This won&rsquo;t work for Movable Type blogs, since MT will overwrite the index.html page when a comment is posted to an entry. Furthermore, I wanted the page to show up for all requests, since many visitors enter the site through Google, and won&rsquo;t see the home page. And finally, I am a lazy person, so I want this to happen automagically.</p>
<p>Therefore I uploaded the file as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actie.html<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and changed my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.htaccess<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file to (temporary) redirect all requests for html pages to the action page. I used the following code:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{TIME_YEAR}%{TIME_MON}%{TIME_DAY} &gt;20050105
RewriteCond %{TIME_YEAR}%{TIME_MON}%{TIME_DAY} &lt;20050107
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} index.s?html$
RewriteRule ^(.*) /actie.html [L,R]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Furthermore I hace changed the action page a little bit. The page basically consisted of a table-based layout, with a single image showing the text. For once I won&rsquo;t complain about table-based layout, since we are working for a good cause, and I value the work they have put into this project. But I did take the freedom to add an alternative text to the image, so that visitors that cannot see the image also know what is going on.</p>

			 <p>My good ol' club <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jong Nederland<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has a new site, based on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mambo Open Source<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†(MOS) CMS. The old site was based on home-brew PHP, and desperately needed a change.</p>
<p>It looks like they have the basic functionality up and running in MOS, but in my opinion they need to work a little bit more on the design. I am sure that they will fix it, since it already looks better than this morning. Of course the horrible &ldquo;Designed for Internet Explorer&rdquo; disclaimer has to go!!!</p>

			 <p>The year 2004 is almost over, which means that it is time for reviews. All important media have a review, so Brain Tags as wel!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lets start with the most important day of this year: August 7. For us the greatest thing of that day was to see all our friends and all our family together. Even though they could not understand each other, it was great to see how they tried to help.</p>
<p>Another personal highlight of 2004 was of course our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->holidays in Thailand<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still have to upload the pictures, but promise that I will do it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>2004 has also been the year of new technology. It started with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a new computer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after cursing on the old one for over two years. I chose a cheap but decent white label box, and expect that it will last seven years as well.</p>
<p>After that came a new cellphone since my &lsquo;old&rsquo; one landed under a car. I am still very happy with my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Siemens M55<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And to bring back some structure in my life, I searched eBay for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PalmOne Zire 31<!-- raw HTML omitted --> PDA. It is used daily, and can&rsquo;t image how I got things done without.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Also my professional life became more interesting, with our participation at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CeBIT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and trips to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cyprus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally, this site. Since it is my hobby, I spend a lot of time tweaking it. This year, I have upgraded the CMS to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->version 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, added a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Link Dump section<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to store links to interesting sites and texts, changed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hosting provider<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since my old provider is going out of business and added a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Music Jukebox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to offer MP3 files.</p>
<p>Quite a good year, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>

			 <p>Since my parents are here to celebrate Christmas with us, we took them to a living nativity scene in Sudanell on the 25<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of December. Each year they show some on the television, but I never actually visited one, so it was interesting for me as well. After buying the entrance tickets, I browsed through the leaflet, and found out that it was not exactly what I expected. I had imagined a place where the main figures would walk around with some animals, but in reality it was a lot more. There were 60 scenes in total with over 250 figures. Furthermore, the figures did not walk around, but stood still as statues. Each scene had been elaborated to the smallest details; everything looked right.</p>
<p>From the clothes to the tools they used! It took us an hour to see all scenes and reach the nativity scene. Besides biblical scenes from the christmas story, there were many scenes showing the life in that era: how to make baskets and soap, the work on the field, etc. We were very impressed. It was a pity that we were not allowed to make photo&rsquo;s, the flash would disturb the figures, but my parents bought a video tape showing all scenes. It is difficult to explain it to others, but we really felt like we were walking around in another era. Next year we surely try to visit another living nativity scene.</p>

			 <p>After the recent messages about comment spam, I have upgraded both Movable Type and MT-Blacklist. Not that my comment spam problem became bigger, since my setup is different enough from the regular MT site to stop them. I have renamed my comment script and, more important, I force commenters to preview. This alone blocks all spam coming in through the comments.</p>
<p>The problem is that once in a while I receive spam through the trackback interface. Since trackbacks, comments on my writings left on other sites, are always generated automatically, I have no way to force a preview and have to use the default workflow. As a result, once in a while a spammer gets through and manages to place many spam on my site before I have the time to add his URL to the blacklist. Of course, after that all spam is deleted with a single click.</p>
<p>Conclusion: So far I am still winning the spam war, but only because I am on top of it with upgrades and by quickly removing spam.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow evening we will take the plane to the Netherlands for a short holiday. We will stay there until Wednesday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that we don&rsquo;t have a lot of opportunities to meet you, since we will spend the weekend with my parents and my sister. In the little time left after the weekend we have many obligations, but will try to meet as much friends as possible. We will bring the DVD of our holidays to keep you away from meeting us. :-D</p>
<p>Wednesday we will also take the photos from our wedding with us to Spain, so there is little time left if you did not see it yet.</p>

			 <p>Today I ran across three situations related to censorship. They are not related to each other, but the coincidence struck me.</p>
<p>First, I found out that my hosting provider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bloghosts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> closed their support forum. Bloghosts gives excellent service and support and I recommend them to everybody looking for a reliable hosting provider. A few weeks ago they had some internal technical problems with their servers, resulting in lost support tickets. While normally support tickets were answered within a few hours, in that period tickets got lost and were not answered. To get the attention of the support staff, some customers started complaining in the support forum. Since normally this forum is very, very quiet, about one post a day, these few people completely took over the forum. The forum is now closed‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Directly after that, I read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Robert Scoble&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are you afraid to blog?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which suffer from a troll called J.Toran. Some commenters requested Robert to remove these comments, but until now they are still there and I expect them to stay there.</p>
<p>And finally D. Keith Robinson wrote about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comment Moderation and Censorship<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after having to remove a whole thread.</p>
<p>As for censorship on this site, until now I only removed commercial comments (spam), but I reserve the right to moderate comments in some other situations as well, as is explained in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comment posting policy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of this site.</p>

<p>Of course not. I don&rsquo;t write about my job because I don&rsquo;t know how my colleagues are going to react. The things happening here simply don&rsquo;t pass to my personal filter; the same filter that blocks all subjects that are too personal.</p>

<p>I am clearly not the only person having these thoughts, and today Robert Scoble tried to convince all of us to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not be afraid to blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He is absolutely right, corporate blogging can give another face to your company.

<p>The jukebox is supposed to handle all requests for MP3 files on Brain Tags. If the requested file exists and the time-out period has not passed yet, the file is served; in all other occasions a list of currently available files is presented.</p>
<p>However, after forwarding MP3 requests to the jukebox, all requests for old MP3 files got redirected to my spamtrap, effectively blocking visitors looking for MP3 files. Of course, I immediately fixed the problem.</p>

			 <p>After all <!-- raw HTML omitted -->problems I encountered last week<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I laid my little video project to rest for a while. Until yesterday; when I felt the itch of an unfinished project. In the mean time I found on the internet how to get around the rendering problem: I simply created another project that contained the problematic scene plus some footage before and after, rendered it to an AVI file, and included this file in my project. A few hours of rendering later I had my DVD!</p>
<p>Happily I inserted the precious disk into our DVD player to admire the result. But‚Ä¶ all sound editing, sound levels and background music, I had done in the project had disappeared and in some scenes the sound was out of sync. Once again I was very disappointed! :-(</p>
<p>I got back on the internet, and search the Pinnacle support forums. There was a huge thread about this problem, which lead me to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FAQ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have to update my software to version 9.0.8 to fix this problem. On the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->download page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I found a huge patch (46 Mb) to update to version 9.1.2. What bothered me most is that this fix is from June, while I purchased the software in September. They simply sold me a defect product, while they had already solved these problems!</p>
<p>I am downloading the patch now, and this afternoon I will buy a DVD+RW disk to try to burn my project again.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The past few weeks I have been working myself into a completely new world: video editing. It all started with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->camera<!-- raw HTML omitted --> we received this spring. Of course we took it with us on holidays, and back home we wondered what to do with the tapes. They contained some nice material, but also a lot of &lsquo;crap&rsquo; produced when trying out the functions of the camera. I wanted to edit the video, and copy the result to a DVD for easy play back.</p>
<p>So I installed the tools that came with the camera on my PC, and connected it to an USB port, only to find out that the software is useless and that USB only supports low quality video. After looking around on the internet a little bit I ordered <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pinnacle Studio DV<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a software suit that comes with a FireWire (IEEE-1394) PCI-card.</p>
<p>After installing the card, I set to work: I copied the tapes to my hard disk, and selected the scenes to be included. I made some dark scenes a little bit lighter, and adjusted the audio levels. After adding some smooth transitions and background music my video was ready for DVD. I set my PC to render for a few hours, and the next morning I had‚Ä¶ an error message! I figured that it must be a full disk, so I cleaned up the disk and set it to render again. The next morning, I found the same error at the exactly same scene; a photo I included in the video.</p>
<p>After a little bit looking around, I found a log file, giving me a more detailed error message: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Max Video Bitrate:8494000 for disc output<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Mmmm. bit rate, that must have something to do with data throughput. Since the problem appeared in a photo, I decided to increase the JPG compression of the file and give it another try. Half a day later I found the same rendering error again. I was getting frustrated, and started to search on the internet, without results. Then I looked in the configuration of Pinnacle Studio, and saw that you could configure the bit rate for DVDs. It was set at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->automatically<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which gave me 60 minutes of video per DVD. Since the error message mentioned a bit rate a little bit above 8Mb, I fixed the bit rate to 8Mb, and let my PC work again&hellip; with the same result as before. Now, I lowered it to 7Mb, and pushed the Create button again. In a few hours I will know whether that has solved the problem, but I have a bad feeling about it‚Ä¶</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update 2004.10.06]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I was right, the error is still there. I did a short test with a project containing only the photos involved, and it rendered correctly. It&rsquo;s time to see how good the support department of Pinnacle is.</p>

			 <p>Each morning before I leave home to go to the office, I take some time to see what is happening in the world. A few years ago, I used newspapers, radio or television for that, but nowadays we have internet. While eating a sandwich and drinking my coffee, I check my e-mail and scan the headlines of about 200 web sites. If I see something interesting, I read it or bookmark it to be read later.</p>
<p>This whole process takes me 20 minutes, thanks to my newsreader which fetches all information from those 200 sites and presents it to me in an easy digestible way.</p>
<p>However, this list of sites I want to keep up with is growing steadily; each week I discover new interesting sites, and add them to my list. When I finished browsing to my list today, I had to run to the office. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to adjust my alarm with 10 minutes to give me the time to read my news.</p>
<p>Just before starting to write all this down, I read that Robert Scoble has exactly the same problem, but worse. He currently checks 915 feeds, and in his entry <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dealing with the information flow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he wonders how scalable feed are, as more and more resources use them. What happens if the number of feeds grows up to 10.000?</p>
<p>I guess what is going to happen is the same as happened to the web. Ten years ago I scanned the NCSA <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is new?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> list. First I looked at this list every week, but soon new sites appeared by thousands, and I left this method to keep up with new sites. Nowadays I use search engines. They are not the same, and don&rsquo;t give met the same feeling, but they scale better. With feeds the same thing is happening: at this moment I follow everything published on some sites, but soon I will have to fall back on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubSub<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to find what I want. I propose they will build some randomness in their queries, so I can still discover some unknown sites, and don&rsquo;t have the feeling that I am reading the same as everybody else.</p>

			 <p>Many people starting to implement the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --> methodology start processing their inboxes full of energy. The first result is usually obtained within a few days: an empty inbox! Everything has been evaluated, using the well know flow chart, and stored in reference files, someday/maybe actions, next actions‚Ä¶ Small tasks (2‚Äìminute rule!) have been finished immediately, and a lot of junk has been thrown away. Great!</p>
<p>Once the big mess is out of the way, you only need to maintain it. Process arriving items as soon as possible, and start working your way through the Next Action list. You even do your first weekly review, to see whether there are any open loops left. You feel that you are getting grip on your workflow.</p>
<p>But usually after two or three weeks, the doubts come up. The processing goes all right, but you have the feeling that actions come in faster than you can finish them. Your N/A list is growing and growing, and looking at your N/A list gives you the same feeling you had before when you opened your inbox. You don&rsquo;t know where to start or how you can set your priorities. You&rsquo;ve lost control.</p>
<p>At this point many people throw GTD out of the window, reasoning that if they spend less time organizing their time, they will have more time for actually doing things. This might be true for some people, but in many cases you simply need to adjust your system to fix the problem. If I have a question about GTD, I always first go to the source. The problem I described here appears on David Allen&rsquo;s site in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FAQ section<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. David&rsquo;s answer is: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If it&rsquo;s &lsquo;too long&rsquo; either you need to get used to a big list of still-undone things [‚Ä¶] or you need to make fewer commitments.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of course this is very true if you implemented the system correctly. But in many cases, the problem is not the amount of commitments, but rather the way these commitments have been entered into the system. Before starting to use GTD, most people work with some kind of to-do list. New GTD users treat their N/A list in exactly the same way as their old list, only now they specify the context of the action. This is wrong, since a task is not the same as a Next Action. Anne Gennett explained it in an excellent way in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The power of the real next action<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In her example, the client needs new glasses. So he creates a N/A &lsquo;Get new glasses&rsquo;. But getting new glasses is not an action! Getting glasses is something you can&rsquo;t do. The real N/A is to email someone for the name of an optometrist, so this is what he should have put in his list.</p>
<p>If you look at a long list that contains items like &lsquo;Get new glasses&rsquo;, you get the feeling that you will never be able to finish the list. But if you put real next actions, your list contains easy to perform steps, and you will see that you can process your next actions more efficiently. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next action is the very first thing you need to do to move on that item.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Even the best drivers sometime get into situations in which they cannot prevent damage.¬†I am not one of the best drivers, so I might get into this kind of situations a little bit more.</p>
<p>This morning when I was driving to the office, I noticed a dog crossing the road. The car coming from the opposite direction stopped, and the dog reached the other side of the road without problems. I was still far away from that point, but I noticed another dog standing next to my side of the road. I imagined that this dog would want to follow his friend, so I slowed down. About ten seconds after spotting the dog, I passed the dog, driving carefully. And exactly at that moment the dog decided to cross the road. I hit the brakes, but could not prevent hitting the poor fellow. Of course I immediately pulled down the car next to the road, and went to look for the dog. However, he was gone ‚Äî I assume he ran away into the orchards next to the road. When I inspected the car, I noticed one bump and a broken spotlight. Tomorrow I will have it repaired.</p>
<p>I would like to use this opportunity to tell the owner of the dog that I am very sorry, but that I could not have prevented it. Sorry‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Recently my server logs show a big increase in requests for a single image, the one shown above. Somebody must be hotlinking this image! Hotlinking is when somebody uses an image on their page, but does not put a copy of the image on their server. Each time somebody views that page, the image is requested from my server. In general, hotlinking images is not polite, since you use bandwidth of somebody else.</p>
<p>This specific image is not mine, I found it on somebody else&rsquo;s page and copied it to my server to use it.</p>
<p>There are several methods to stop hotlinking. You can block all requests that do not come from your own site, so all visitors of that site will see is a red x. Or you can serve another image instead, with a text explaining why hotlinking is bad, or with the Goatse man&hellip; I decided not to do so. First of all, since I have enough bandwidth to serve these sites, and secondly because I thought it would be better to use the image to make some advertising for my site. So I added this site&rsquo;s address to the image, so it will be shown on all sites using this image from my site.</p>

			 <p>That&rsquo;s it! The upgrade went flawless. Everything seems to work fine until now. Of course I haven&rsquo;t tried out any of the new features yet. There are two features I would like to have a look at.</p>
<p>The ability to create subcategories look really sexy, however I have doubts whether my writings need a more complex category structure. I will have to review all items to decide on that.</p>
<p>The feature everybody waited a long time for is dynamic publishing. It simply means that the pages are created <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the fly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which makes posting entries and comments more faster since you don&rsquo;t have to wait for all pages to generate. However, the downside is that each normal view will be slightly slower, since the pages are not cached on the server. I will have to play a little bit with this to see what works best.</p>

			 <p>Almost a week ago we returned from our holiday in Thailand. The fact that I did not write anything about it yet has two reasons:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But since the first page of this site looks very empty, I will write a little bit about our trip.</p>
<p>Unlike all our previous vacations, we did not prepare the trip ourselves, but we decided to get &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; and have a travel agency work out the details for us. That means that we didn&rsquo;t have to think for a single second when we were in Thailand. The planes and the hotels were booked, and each morning they picked us up for yet another interesting excursion. Of course the downside of this is that we only ended up in places cramped with other tourists and did not make any unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>We visited Bangkok, Chang Rai, Chang Mai and Ko Samui. Each of these places offered basically the same: souvenirs, temples, souvenirs, tuk-tuks, souvenirs, great food, souvenirs, massages, souvenirs, fake watches, souvenirs, canals, souvenirs and souvenirs. Besides these basics, each of the places had something special: Bangkok is a true metropolis, Chang Rai has beautiful hills and their tribes, Chang Mai has a lot of traditional handicraft and Ko Samui has of course the beach.</p>
<p>There is much more to tell about our holiday. Maybe I will tell you about it over a good glass of beer, or someday I will write it down here‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>I was always thought that the Netherlands have two languages: Dutch and Frisian. Besides these two languages, many dialects exist. Spain in contrary, has 5 languages: Castilian, Basque, Catalan, Galician and Aragonese.</p>
<p>Today I found out these numbers are wrong. Or not? The languages I mentioned above are the languages that have an official status in those countries, based on history and culture. The real number of languages (linguistically seen) is higher: there are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15 languages in the Netherlands<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 languages in Spain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So Spain, which has twelve times the size of the Netherlands has less languages ‚Äîand less water, but that is another subject‚Äî than the Netherlands.</p>
<p>For the curious readers: in the Netherlands, people speak Achterhoeks, Drents, Dutch, (Western) Frisian, Gronings, Romani (Sinte), Romani (Vlax), Sallands, Stellingwerfs, Twents, Veenkoloniaals, Veluws (East), Veluws (North), Vlaams and Westerwolds. In Spain, the following languages exist: Aragonese, Asturian, Basque, Cal√≥, Catalan-Valencian-Balear, Extremaduran, Fala, Galician, Gascon (Aranese), Quinqui and Spanish.</p>

<p>The XML fan says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time for that! We must train all the audience members to recognise XML, and then start a committee to investigate the possibility of starting negotiations to form a working group to write a paper on the future evolution of emergency-announcement semantics!&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Six months ago I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->set some targets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for myself for this year. Now that I am halfway the year, it is time to evaluate my progress:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My Spanish is definitely better, simply because I have been using it some months more. I planned to study more structurally, but so far I haven&rsquo;t spent a single minute doing this. There&rsquo;s still work to do on this one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am on schedule on this one; I expect to finish this task in 36 days.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have more contact with my old friends in Holland than I had last year. However, for my feeling it can be even better.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The plans have been made, now all we have to do is say to eachother to start. I still have hope.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is the most vague item on the list, and I don&rsquo;t know how I can &lsquo;measure&rsquo; the result. My feeling tells me that it hasn&rsquo;t changed much.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My plans for the near future, 2‚Äì3 years, are ready. But what do I want with the rest of my life?????</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For several reasons, we haven&rsquo;t made as many excursions as we would like. Now that summer has come, the only nature we can visit is the Mediteranian Sea. This item has been postponed to autumn.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not started yet&hellip;
All in all I have the feeling that at 50% of the year I haven&rsquo;t reached 50% of my aims.</p>

			 <p>I have been using the services of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mobical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for some time now, mainly to back up my cell phone&rsquo;s contact list, and have been very satisfied. Once in a while I press the button on my phone, and I know that all my phone numbers are stored safely on a server in Sweden. They also supply a web interface to your data, so you can enter your contacts with more than nine buttons, but I never used that.</p>
<p>Today I visited them again, and noticed that they have created version two of their service. Version two is not backwards compatible, so I had to create a new account. After setting up my account, I uploaded the data from my phone, and looked around at the site. It all looks very professional, and I can imagine that some people use this as their main agenda contact list. It has a nice overview window with the upcoming meetings and tasks, and you can browse your contacts in an intuitive way. Notes have been implemented as post-it notes glued to each page, with the option to drag them with your mouse. Really neat&hellip; if you only have one note. I tend to store many small pieces of useful information as notes on my phone (I definitely have to buy me a Palm) and the pot-its became very annoying. I tried to close the &lsquo;windows&rsquo;, but a pop-up warned me that I was about to delete the note.</p>
<p>For the moment I continue to use Mobical as always: to back-up my data.</p>

			 <p>Summer in Lleida has a bad name. Being in the inlands without any lake and usually without even a small breeze makes Lleida a very hot place. The hottest months yet have to come and the temperature is already at 38¬∞C. With this kind of temperatures you have only two options to spend your free time: inside the water (a swimming pool or the sea) or in the mountains. In both cases it is advisable to leave early in the morning, as driving a car can be unbearable during the day.</p>
<p>This weekend we chose the swimming pool option, since we didn&rsquo;t feel like driving very far. As a result, our activities were limited to those you can do in a swimming pool, which is basically limited to reading. Fortunately I still had to read the latest <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linux Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but for next weekend I will have to buy some books.</p>

			 <p>Just like many people, sometimes my head bursts of all things I have to remember and to do. In fact, my short‚Äîterm memory is terrible; I am able to tell you to do something and completely forget about it within 10 minutes. The reason for this is that I can be completely focussed on the action I am doing at the moment. I am aware of this problem, and have tried out many strategies to overcome this. How can I process the enormous amount of information I receive by e-mail, hear from colleagues and clients and read on the internet without getting drowned in it, so that I can actually get things done?</p>
<p>The answer for me lies in the last three words: for the last year I have been applying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Allen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s methodology called Getting Things Done. This method looks a lot like the things I have been trying out before; only it is worked out a lot better. The basis is to process your inbox (which can be mail, paper, phone‚Ä¶) and fill your calendar and next action system.

			 <p>More and more people are buying digital cameras; I even read that the digital camera sales outnumber the traditional film cameras nowadays. I am very happy with my Canon film camera, but after I have been playing with my parents' new Sony digital camera last week I wondered whether a digital camera would be something for me. Of course as a gadget it would most certainly be welcome, but as a replacement for my current film camera it will need to add much additional benefits. So I made a little comparison:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In short, digital cameras give you ease of use and electronic access to your photographs, while film cameras give you quality and are cheaper. The choice is up to you. For me it is not so important having a digital photograph ‚Äî though I would like to publish more photo&rsquo;s on this site. On a cold Sunday in winter, I like to grab a photo album and browse through the images on my sofa. I don&rsquo;t think I can have that same feeling sitting behind my computer. For the moment I still prefer film cameras to digital cameras, but maybe I might buy a very cheap digital camera for those moments I want to send a photo by e-mail or publish it on this site.</p>

<p>The most important missing feature is a good installation procedure.

			 <p>When you travel by car through Europe, you&rsquo;ll find that the traffic rules are more or less the same for all countries. Of course there are some minor differences as the maximum speed on ‚Äî120 km/h in the Netherlands, 130 km/h in France‚Äî but in general the rules are the same. Nobody ever warned for the fact that the Standard European Traffic Rules are not valid in Spain. The confusing part is that the used signs are exactly the same, but the interpretation might surprise visitors from abroad. Therefore I decided to write here about the differences I experienced, starting with the most disturbing rule: the minimum speed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each road has a minimum speed, which is normally shown with a sign equally to the one above. In general the minimum speeds are as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very important<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†to obey the minimum speed. Fortunately, the local drivers are very friendly and will warn you if you are driving slower than the minimum. They will signal with their lights and horns, wave with their arms and even shout at you. In case you miss these signals, they will risk their lives and approach you with their own car up to a distance of 30 centimetres. They assume that once you will notice them you accelerate to keep their lives out of danger.</p>

<p>In the good ol' HTML era, I would simply add <!-- raw HTML omitted -->align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->img<!-- raw HTML omitted --> element, and I would be done.

But this is impossible, since I don&rsquo;t know the contents on beforehand.</p>
<p>What I would want is to apply a certain style depending on the child element; something like: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->div &lt; img {text-align:center}<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Since this kind of instructions do not exist, I will probably have to use some kind of JavaScript hack to accomplish what I want ‚Äî or does anybody know a better solution?</p>

			 <p>I have restructured my templates for this site. The old ones used way too many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;div&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;span&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s, which cluttered up the HTML ‚Äî these elements are today&rsquo;s equivalent of the tables in the 90‚Äôs. I decided to start from zero and only add those elements that I think are necessary. As a result, the new pages are smaller, which should make them faster for you.</p>
<p>To make things easier for me, I decided to use another Document Type Definition. This site is now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XHTML 1.0 Strict<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, instead of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XHTML 1.1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. To me it feels a little bit like a loss, since I liked it that my site was on the forefront of web technology, but the hassle is simple too big. The biggest problem is that a lot of JavaScript won&rsquo;t work, and my knowledge is not enough to fix these things myself.</p>
<p>I also took the opportunity to activate the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TypeKey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service for those people who want to use it. It is not required; I only see it as a means for showing to the readers that it was really you who wrote this comment. As an alternative you can still use OpenPGP to certify your comments.</p>
<p>There are still some things not going quite as I wanted to, and the quickly adjusted stylesheet makes this site look even worse than before in Internet Explorer, but I will be working on those. If you notice any strange behaviour or mistake, please let me know.</p>

			 <p>Last week when I entered my hotel room and switched on the light, the TV turned on and showed me a welcome message explaining how to use Pay TV. First I did not pay any attention to this screen, and I started unpacking my bags. When I passed the TV for about the fifth time, I suddenly saw something I did not notice before. On the top of the screen I could see a blue bar with some letters below it. I was amazed. The welcome message was simply a text file written in Write, and the whole system appeared to be running Windows 3.1!!!</p>
<p>It has been a long time ago since I last saw Windows 3.1 in use. I thought that everybody had already switched a long time ago to Windows 9x, but it seems that there are still some of these legacy systems around. Surely the system is running good enough, so why change it?</p>

			 <p>Four days ago I upgraded the motor of this site to Movable Type version 3.0D ‚Äî the D is for Developer edition. Unlike many others who installed this version, I was fully aware that this developer edition could have some problems with plug-ins. Here are my findings of the first days playing around.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dashboard<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The first screen of the MT interface clearly shows a new item: the Movable Type News box. This box syndicates news from the Movable Type web site. Since I prefer to read my news in my feed reader, I immediately <!-- raw HTML omitted -->removed this box<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Another thing changed in the main screen is the direct access to some weblog features. The 2.x versions had for each weblog links to create a new entry and to enter the entries list. Now you can also access the comments list, the templates list and the weblog configuration screen. The one thing I am missing here is the upload file feature, since I assume that bloggers will more often upload an image than tinker with their templates.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edit Entry<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Also the Entry Edit screen has some ‚Äîminor‚Äî modifications. It is now possible to specify the entry date &amp; time the moment you create a new entry. In the older versions you first had to save your entry to modify the publishing time. That leaves only one feature that cannot be modified in new entries: the multiple categories.</p>
<p>Another change is that the edit buttons now also work in Mozilla based browsers, but only for the entry body. If you use the extended entry field, you still have to enter the HTML code yourself.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The comments list is new and handy feature to manage your comments. You can see the details and the status of the last comments, and open them from that screen. You can filter comments on e-mail, name and IP address, but unfortunately not on status. I don&rsquo;t receive many comments, but I assume that more popular sites would love to see only the comments that are pending for approval.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trackback<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In my definition, trackbacks are nothing more than comments on my entries left on other sites. I would like to treat trackbacks in exactly the same way as comments, but unfortunately trackbacks do not have status information.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plug-ins<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of the 13 plug-ins I use for this site, I removed two after upgrading.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->MT-Blacklist is not compatible with MT3.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I am removing comment spammers by hand again.</p>
<p>The Optional-Redirect plug-in is not necessary anymore, since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the same can be achieved in MT 3.0<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no_redirect=&ldquo;1&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>All other plug-ins work the same way as before.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Individual Archive template<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Most of my time went into trying to adjust the individual archive template. There have been many changes to this template to incorporate the TypeKey service, but I have not yet been able to get them to work when served as XHTML 1.1 with MIME type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The smallest problem was to validate the template as XHTML 1.1. The new code uses some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->name<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s, which I changed into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->id<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s, and I had to edit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lib/MT/Template/Context.pm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so it won&rsquo;t use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->valign<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->border<!-- raw HTML omitted --> anymore &ndash; look at line 1476.</p>
<p>A bigger problem is the JavaScript. Things like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->document.comments_form.email.value<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is easy enough changed into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->document.getElementById(&lsquo;email&rsquo;).value<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I don&rsquo;t know how to fix <!-- raw HTML omitted -->document.write<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so it works both on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text/html<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The last problem I have with my template is that it shows the wrong comment form; the one that is normally used when TypeKey authentication is obligatory. I still have to find out what is going wrong here.</p>

			 <p>The radar is a handy and necessary tool in the aviation business. A long time ago, when there was not much trafic, there was no need for a radar; for the people in the control towers it was enough to have visual contact with the airplane the moment it arrived. But as trafic increased more sophisticated systems were needed. Nowadays all incoming and outgoing planes appear on the radar screens, unless they fly too low.</p>
<p>Exactly the same is happening on the internet. Ten years ago, it was easy enough to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->surf<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the few interesting sites on a weekly basis. But as the internet grew and more sites started to publish more material, this became a kludge. I am interested in the content of about 100 sites, which I try to read on a regulary basis. Some of these sites publish daily news, some of them are only updated once a month. Four years ago I had my bookmarks ordered by update frequency: I had a folder called &lsquo;daily&rsquo; which contained sites I tried to visit on daily basis, etc. But as the number of sites increased, it became undoable to keep on visiting all those sites.</p>
<p>So I started using the internet equivalent of the radar: feed readers. Most sites publish their content in several formats. Besides the usual HTML pages, many sites also publish their news in a short format as RSS or Atom. My feed reader fetches those so-called feeds every X minutes, and notifies me when a site has been updated. This saves me a lot of time! But there are still many sites <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flying under the radar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sites that do not provide feeds, sites which I still have to visit manually, many times only to find out that nothing has changed. I found out that I am visiting these sites less and less. They are about to dissapear from my screen, I simply do not have the time to keep on visiting them.</p>
<p>And I am not the only one. Many people read the texts of this site through a feed reader, and even more use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my feeds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to see whether I updated my site. So webmasters: don&rsquo;t fly under the radar, but give your readers the option to use feed readers!</p>

			 <p>I have upgraded to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type 3.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and am trying to fix the templates at the moment. During the next days, posting comments might give some problems, but I am working on it.</p>
<p>On the web a lot of people complain about the new licences, but I haven&rsquo;t got any problems with it. As this site uses only three webblogs &ndash;the main site, the photo site and one for static content&ndash; and has only one author &ndash;that&rsquo;s me :-D&ndash;, I fall exactly within the limits of the free licence. And if I really need more, I have no problem paying for it. Let&rsquo;s face it, they made a far better CMS than I will ever be able to make myself.</p>
<p>The installation went without any problems, the pesky part is in the Individual Archive templates. There have been many changes, and I will have to go through my code line-by-line to see what I have to change.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To make it even more difficult, they did not escape ampersands in their code! The same thing happened in their 2.66 update, and I really expected that they&rsquo;d learned something. Anyway, soon I expect version 3.01, which fixes these errors in the JavaScript.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Another problem I ran into is their use of JavaScript as: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->document.comments_form.email.value = getCookie(&ldquo;mtcmtmail&rdquo;);<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which typically won&rsquo;t work in documents served as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have to change all these lines to use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->document.getElementById<!-- raw HTML omitted --> function.</p>
<p>You notice: work enough to do, so I&rsquo;ll better get back into debugging mode.</p>

			 <p>There is a law that is valid on both the internet as on every school yard: how important you are depends on who your friends are. Nowadays on the internet, your importance is expressed as PageRank. PageRank is a number between 0 and 10, calculated in a very secret way, but based on the amount of links to your site and the PageRank of the sites linking to you. If you own a site with a high PageRank (8+) you can earn a lot of money by simply putting a link to other sites on your homepage.</p>
<p>Knowing this, I wondered how popular I am. What is the PageRank of this site, where on the internet popularity scale am I. I looked it up, and found that I am exactly in the middle; I have a PageRank of 5/10. I am not the most popular guy on the school yard, but neither a looser without any friends.</p>
<p>This made me wonder what I had to do to get a 6. What kind of sites have a 6? And a 7? So I visited some sites from my bookmarks and made a short list with example sites for each PageRank:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was quite difficult to find sites with PageRank 1 and 2. Most sites I found have a PageRank of 3 and 4. Most popular sites reside at PageRank 8. Jong Nederland Harmelen obviously did something very wrong, since Google punishes them hard for not letting the GoogleBot spider their site.</p>

<p>Why does AdSense give better results than a normal search? I guess the reason is that AdSense works in a reverse way. In a normal search I enter a few keywords, and the engine returns me a zillion of results. AdSense analyses the whole text, and returns only a few results. Of course I tried to paste the whole text in a normal Google search, but I found out that Google has a limit of only 10 keywords. Another reason for the better performance is that AdSense has a very limited database, containing almost exclusively commercial products and services.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great internet browser, and I just love tabbed browsing. Each day I look in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloglines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to see which sites have been updated, and I open up all interesting reading matter in new tabs ‚Äî I CRTL-click more than I click. After that I go one by one through my tabs, reading each page and opening interesting links in new tabs. I continue doing so until I have closed all my tabs, or until I run out of time, in which case I simply bookmark all open tabs. The good thing about loading pages on tabs it that I can load many pages before I read them; each time I close a tab, I find a new page waiting for me.</p>
<p>But there is one thing that annoys me. As you might know, I am very interested in web design, and many sites I read are about standards web design. Therefore, more and more sites I visit are standards compliant: clean HTML and designed with CSS. In my opinion Firefox does not handle these sites correctly, since it only starts loading background images the moment I focus on a tab. Thus many times I close a tab, I am confronted with an almost white page with some text on it, which then is converted little by little in a beautiful design. I do not understand why Firefox waits until I focus on the tab and does not pre-load the background images while I am reading other sites.</p>
<p>Or is there some hidden configuration option I don&rsquo;t know about?</p>

			 <p>SyncML is an XML standard for synchronizing data between devices. The most common use for it is to create back-up copies of your cellphone data, or even synchronise it with your desktop PIM.</p>
<p>I want that too! The user manual of my phone describes how I can set up synchronisation to store a copy my data on the Siemens web site. But‚Ä¶. it did not work. After looking in every corner of the Siemens site, I came to the conclusion that they only support SyncML for some countries, and Spain is not one of them. Also on the site of my provider Movistar I could not find anything about SyncML.</p>
<p>In the mean time I read a little bit more about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SyncML<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and came to the conclusion that it is a very simple XML based protocol. Besides that, I figured that the average cellphone has a maximum 5Mb of data, so it must be very cheap to set up a SyncML server. My friend Google showed me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->companies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offering SyncML accounts, but they charge the same amount that I pay for hosting this whole site!!!</p>
<p>Mmm, maybe I can find some software that I can install on my own server. Once again I asked my friend Google, and he offered me two solutions: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sync4j<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a Java based solution, which requires setting up a Java server (JBoss or Tomcat). I run Apache, and I prefer to use a solution that also uses Apache.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->second option<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a PHP solution with a mySQL back-end. That sounds a lot better! I quickly set up the database and installed the script. But my phone could not synchronize. :-( I assume that my phone uses the binary WBXML format, which is not yet supported by the script&hellip;</p>
<p>What next?</p>

			 <p>Yesterday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wrote about some usability problems with cellphones<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As I am exploring the functionality of my new phone, I have run into some more small usability problems.</p>
<p>Yesterday I already wrote about the fast access button asking for a confirmation. The reason they did this was probably to provide the user with an easy way to configure the fast access buttons. The moment I use the fast access button, a screen appears asking me whether I want to start the selected function or whether I want to modify the function linked to the button. Though in general it is handy to have the configuration option close to the functionality, in this case it definitely gets in the way. If I have to confirm the action each time I use the fast access button, the access won&rsquo;t be that fast anymore!</p>
<p>Another thing bothering me with many phones is the hassle I have to go through to send a SMS message. After writing the message, I have to go through the following steps to send it to somebody from my phone list:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Usually I need a minimum of 7 key-presses to send my message. If you compare that with how easy it is to write the message ‚ÄîT9 is great‚Äî, you can only come to the conclusion that something is going wrong here.</p>
<p>Maybe this set-up is useful for some people, but I assume that most people are like me, and almost always send messages to people from the phone list. In my opinion, the procedure should be the following:</p>

			 <p>Got it!!!</p>
<p>This weekend I finally got some time to walk to the shop and buy a new cellphone. They girl helping me wanted to show me many models, but I interrupted her to tell her first my criteria:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My first criteria limited the selection to those models for which my provider had an offer. Of these I could immediately remove all camera phones, smart phones, and big old models which left me with 3 phones to choose from (I don&rsquo;t remember which were the other two). This brought me to my third criterion, usability. The girl told me that all phones are equally easy to use, which made me shock in horror, since most phones have major usability problems! And each generation of phones gets more features and thus more horrible usability decisions are made.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After trying out the three models a little bit, I decided to go for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Siemens M55<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, even though it had a big usability problem popping up immediately: on the main screen two fast access buttons are shown: &lsquo;menu&rsquo; on the right, and a book icon on the left. I expected that the book icon would directly open up my address book, but to my horror a confirmation screen appeared, on which I had to select &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to open my address book. Of course the people in the shop could not explain me why I had to press the button twice to open up a basic function as the address book.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a cellphone again and still many hours to go to find out how things work.</p>

			 <p>Last weekend Berry &amp; Manon visited us. The good thing about people spending their holiday with us, is that we also get a little bit the &lsquo;holiday feeling&rsquo;. Normally we use part of the weekend to clean the house, do some shopping and work in the house, but now we did all this during the days before. So we had all the time to relax!
On Friday evening we welcomed our guest with a beer, after which we ate a little bit. This to initiate them to the Catalan culture of spending a lot of time eating and drinking, usually a few hours later than they do in Holland &ndash; we had supper at 23:00.
Saturday morning was a typical vacation morning. After sleeping a bit longer than usual, taking a shower and having a long breakfast, the morning was over. Time to head over to the city centre to take a beer on a terrace! Back home we had a long lunch and a short sleep (siesta!). When it started to become dark we walked outside to do some window shopping and compare the prices with those in Holland. In the evening Berry and I went to see a Basketball match, while Manon and Maria Jos√© had some tapas. We finished the day in a fine restaurant.
After so much eating and drinking, we decided to have a slightly more active day on Sunday. The morning was the same as on Saturday, but after that we took the car to visit Montserrat and Sitges. At the end of the day we left them in front of a hotel in the middle of the Ramblas of Barcelona, so they would not have to travel a lot on Monday.
Berry and Manon: thanks for getting us to relax!</p>

This Saturday I hope to have some time to do some shopping, but am afraid that once again I won&rsquo;t have the time for it. I want to bring my suit to the chemical cleaner, I want to develop the pictures we made in Easter, and I want to buy a new cellphone. And as a true gadget freak, it itches to know that you really need a new gadget (my old phone is completely destroyed), and probably won&rsquo;t have the time to buy it! :-(</p>

			 <p>One of the problems of using the XHTML 1.1 doctype is the fact that your pages need to be completely valid in order to be displayed. If there is one single error in the XHTML code, the browser will display an error message. This in difference with HTML and XHTML 1.0 pages, which browsers will try to show even if the code contains errors.
Of course, all my templates contain valid code, but the problem comes when I or my commenters use code in my texts. It is always the parts that are not automated where the problems appear :-(
The number one error screwing up my valid pages is the use of ampersands (<code>&amp;amp;</code>). Since ampersands have a special meaning in XHTML, you&rsquo;ll have to enter the <em>entity code</em> <code>&amp;amp;</code> to display an ampersand.
In my texts I don&rsquo;t use many ampersands, but many URL¬¥s do contain ampersands. And usually URL&rsquo;s are simply copied and pasted from the browser address bar, without verifying the address, resulting in an error message instead of a link.
But now I hope I solved this problem. I just installed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->latest version<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SafeHref plugin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which automagically repairs this error.</p>

			 <p>Now that I am back home again and took some time to catch some sleep, it&rsquo;s time to tell about the CeBIT experience. It was my first time at the biggest technology fair in the world, and the first time ICG was present with their own stand. Therefore I did not really know what to expect. I assumed to see many new things, but not in the area where we have our stand. The POS world is a niche market after all.
Since we never did this before, we did not spend huge amounts of money on the stand. We simply ordered a basic stand and transported all other materials ourselves. That meant that we spent two days on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->autoroutes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->autobahn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and one day constructing the stand. As a result, we were already tired before the show started, and looked very jealously at all consultants freshly arriving at the Microsoft stand and finding their cup of coffee already prepared.
Like I already said, our stand was situated in a specialized POS corner, so the big public did probably not pass our stand. However, the people walking around in that particular section were exactly the people we wanted to talk to. We made many good contacts, and we have very good hopes on a good number of dealer wanting to distribute our software.
What surprised us was the change in visitor types by day. On the first two days (Thursday and Friday), the audience was very international. We attended people from all over the world, but did not see many Germans. In the weekend, many students and families visited the show, which did not bring us many contacts. Monday and Tuesday suddenly the Germans and Dutch showed up, while the foreigners seemed to have gone home. On Wednesday the only visitors to the show were some teenagers begging for goodies, so it was very quiet. This made the Wednesday a perfect day to visit other exhibitors, and they also visited us.
What I really missed at the CeBIT was the new technology buzz. I did not notice any excitement, did not see a single new gadget. It was even very difficult to get internet access. I expected it to be a lot more on the forefront of technology.</p>

<p>What happened this morning in Madrid is inhuman and cannot be justified. I can only guess for the reasons behind this horrible deed, but know that whatever they were trying to reach is not going to happen, in contrary.</p>
<p>If they wanted to put political parties up against each other, they failed, since all parties now form one front against terrorism.</p>
<p>If they wanted to show their strength, they will fail, since the government (whoever will win the elections the coming weekend) will be very convinced in finding the people behind this attack.</p>

			 <p>Today it is raining in Lleida. So what? Well, the problem is that the people over here are not used to rain. When it is raining, the people simply stay inside until the rain is over.</p>
<p>When I drove this morning past the market square, I could see all merchants waiting inside their cars, still packed. They were waiting for the rain to stop, because their clients won&rsquo;t show up when it is raining. I was imagining that Dutch merchants would have the same mentality; they would only be able to sell during some weeks in summer! But that is mainly because the Dutch clients are used to the rain; they simply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to.</p>
<p>Of course there are situations in which even the Dutch people stay at home, and the amount of snow today created such a situation. The Dutch only stay at home when it is impossible to get out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my parents have to catch a flight to Barcelona in a few hours, so at this moment they are desperately trying to get to the airport. I just checked the news, but there are no trains going to Amsterdam and there are huge traffic jams on all highways. I really hope they are able to make it in time!!! üò±</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update 2004.02.26]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: They managed to get to Schiphol airport by train, and I assume they have arrived safely in Barcelona. Just a few hours more, and I will meet them. üòâ</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When entering a comment in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> powered site, a radio button is available telling you that it is going to ‚ÄòRemember personal info‚Äô. However, sometimes when you come back to the same site and want to write another comment, all fields are empty. Your personal info has not been saved‚Ä¶ üôÅ</p>
<p>The problem I described above appears regularly on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type support forum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and since the answer is always the same, I created this explanation, so I only have to point here to answer the question.</p>
<p>First a small explanation on how the system is supposed to work. If you enter a comment and select the ‚ÄòRemember personal info‚Äô radio button, your name, address and URL are stored in a so-called cookie on your computer. This cookie contains the domain of the site, the directory for which the cookie is valid, an expiration date, and of course the stored value. For example, if I post a comment on an entry of this site, a cookie with the name mtcmdhome will be created with the following information:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This will make sure that the URL I entered (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) will be stored for one year, and can be used by any page on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.jeroensangers.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sites.</p>
<p>MT sets this cookie using JavaScript, which you can find in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Individual Entry Archive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> template. You can find this script at line 29 of the default template.</p>
<p>By default, the script does not specify a path for the cookie, so that the cookie is stored using the path of the individual entry page. So the cookie of this page would only be valid for pages in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/2004/01/mt_does_not_remember_personal_info<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is only one page. Since the cookie is not valid for my other pages, the details I filled in when commenting on this page won&rsquo;t show up in other pages. Note that the default MT installation places all archives in a single directory (e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/archives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), so this problem does not appear.</p>
<p>If you do place your archives into different directories, you&rsquo;ll have to need to adjust the JavaScript in the template to fit your situation. The key is that you need to specify the directory for the cookie depending on the set-up of your site. If you have your own domain like I have, you can set it to ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô to be valid for the whole domain. If you use a directory on the domain of your provider (e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://example.com/username/">http://example.com/username/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->), you can set it to ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/username<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô.</p>
<p>To set the directory for the cookies, edit the functions <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rememberMe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forgetMe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in your template. The location for the path has to be inserted between the two apostrophes before <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HOST<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The original code is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The code for <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://example.com/username/">http://example.com/username/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> becomes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After making these small changes, the cookie is valid for your whole site, and the details filled in when creating a comment show up on all the pages.</p>

Mozilla told me that there was a XML parsing error, and since I am serving my pages as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Moz did not parse the page at all. I quickly changed my server settings so that my pages are served as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text/html<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and looked into the code.</p>
<p>The problem is that MT is now using a proxy script to link to the sites mentioned in comments, so spammers do not receive any &lsquo;Google Karma&rsquo; by posting comments. The problem lies in the use of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the URL, while they should have used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;amp;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For example, a link to this site appears as:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red">http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->u=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2F&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>while they should have used:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red">http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;amp;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->u=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2F&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I did a quick search in the new files, and found the error in the file <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lib/MT/Template/Context.pm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at line 1189. Just add 4 characters, and MT produces valid HTML again.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update 2004.01.16]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> published MT version 2.661 to fix this problem.</p>

			 <p>As everybody knows, WAP is not the mobile killer protocol, nor will it ever be. However, it has its uses.¬†I use it for example to consult my bank account when I&rsquo;m on the road.</p>
<p>For Telefonica,- the Spanish phone monopolist, WAP also has its uses, since they offer Emoci√≥n; WAP-based services of which some bring in some money for every minute it is used.</p>
<p>The thing I never understood is that they sell packages with modern phones like my T200 with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->badly configured WAP access<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If it doesn&rsquo;t work directly, many people won&rsquo;t try it again!</p>
<p>The case is that the phone comes preconfigured with WAP over GPRS, but to use GPRS you&rsquo;ll have to buy a separate contract or pre-paid card, which nobody does. But Telefonica finally got smart. Saturday, when I was taking a beer on a sunny terrace I suddenly noticed a new icon on my phone&rsquo;s screen; I had GPRS access!!!</p>
<p>Of course I immediately changed my WAP configuration and tried it out. I surfed around in WAP space a little, until I came to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my own WML feed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which failed miserably. One more point on my todo list‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Christmas is already finished, but I still would like to wish everybody a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year.</p>
<p>Even though we live far away from my family, we were able to spend Christmas with both families. On Christmas Eve we had a wonderful traditional Catalan family supper over here, and the day after we jumped in the airplane to celebrate a Dutch Christmas (I am not going to compare the two ways of celebrating; they do not differ that much and I like them both).</p>
<p>Anyway, as usual my time in Holland was way too short. I would have liked to spend more time with my family and friends and maybe visited some nice places together, but that will have to wait for my next visit. We have planned to go again with Easter, but maybe I will book another flight earlier.</p>

<p>Now that I have been working with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LOAF<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for several days, I have the feeling that the technology is not completely finished yet. I have studied many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LOAF implementations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but have the feeling that most implementations are just too difficult to implement.</p>
<p>A lot of implementations are written in obscure programming languages, and need a powerful server to run on. But this way the LOAF technology is kept away from the big audience, who know nothing about programming. In my opinion, LOAF should be more easy to use, Joe Sixpack should be able to use it on his blog. And that preferably by only changing a single setting in his weblogging software.</p>
<p>So, I decided to create a LOAF implementation in CSS. Notice that this stylesheet is XHTML1.1 ready, since it also styles the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†element. You only need to copy the file to your server and your site is completely LOAF-compliant.</p>

			 <p>The latest trick spammers have is setting up fake blogs, usually with the design copied from another site.</p>
<p>Though these sites look harmless, all links direct you to pr0n sites. To get visitors to their ‚Äòwebblogs‚Äô, they use a trick known as referrer spam. They request pages from other sites, pretending to come from a link on their weblog.</p>
<p>Since many sites display the referrers on one of their pages, home page or statistics page, the spammer effectively creates links to his site this way. And the more links to your site you have, the higher you get in Google&rsquo;s search results, which results automatically in more visitors!!! You can read more about all this at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->idly.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Even though I do not display my referrers, and Google does not spider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my statistics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I still don&rsquo;t want these spammers to use my site. So I blocked them based on the referer field by adding the following code to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.htaccess<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file:</p>

			 <p>Just when we were cooking our evening meal yesterday, we were suddenly without electricity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo problem‚Äù, I said to Maria Jos√©, since we have these handy earth leakage switches. I was able to find my small Jong Nederland torchlight in the dark, and went to the entrance to flip the guilty switch.</p>
<p>But all switches were in the correct position. I went outside our apartment to the stairs, and turned on the light; it switched on immediately. I noticed that our neighbours upstairs also had light, so the problem was definitely only in our apartment.</p>
<p>Then I noticed a box high on the walls in the stairs, with two cables coming from it, entering our apartment. I got some stairs, opened the box and found two old-fashioned fuses. One of them was clearly burned and still hot. Found it!</p>
<p>Now we had to find a replacement fuse. I remember having seen some when we were reconstructing our house, but I was very afraid that we threw them away, since we had our fuses replaced by those modern switches. A quick look around in the most easy accessible places did not deliver us the fuses. We started getting a little bit worried about the things in our fridge and, more important, our meal. While Maria Jos√© was getting ready to bring the contents of our fridge to our neighbours, I decided to check the closet downstairs one more time.</p>
<p>And there they were; two fuses of at least 20 years old. They had a little bit less capacity than the old ones, but at least they would get us through the night.</p>
<p>Today I checked two shops to buy new fuses, but so far I haven‚Äôt been lucky. Tomorrow I will contact an electrician, because in my eyes it is very ridiculous that we have these old fuses in front of our modern earth leakage switches, and I have a high suspicion that they are not necessary at all.</p>

		<a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/11/11/email-disclaimers.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-11-11 21:46:06 &#43;0200">Nov 11, 2003</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>More and more mail I receive has some kind of legal disclaimer attached to it. And I am getting more and more annoyed by it. The typical disclaimer usually contains something like the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So if I am not the intended recipient, this text tells me that I may not use the information in the e-mail. But I only know about these conditions when I am reading the disclaimer at the end of the message; too late. If you want to force these conditions on me, I&rsquo;ll have to accept them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reading the message, in the same way a licence is presented to me before I install software, right?</p>
<p>And imagine that I am not the intended recipient, why can&rsquo;t I use the information inside the message to find out who is the intended recipient and forward the message to this person? You clearly forbid this. The same rule also forbids me to tell the sender of his mistake.</p>
<p>Besides the kind of problems described above, such a statement should have no force of law. The sender can&rsquo;t in general unilaterally stipulate conditions on what the recipient may or may not do with the email. In specific cases, such as copyright, the author may, of course, stipulate what rights are granted to the recipient. There are other instances where there is an implied contract of confidentiality, but those are not created merely by the sender sticking the word ‚Äòconfidential‚Äô on a message.</p>
<p>Just compare it to your communication on paper. Do you add a disclaimer to every memo you send out? I don&rsquo;t think so! So why on earth do you want to add this text to e-mail? Usually the answer is: ‚ÄúBecause my boss told me to do it‚Äù. Your boss is of course worried about the consequences of your writings, which I can understand, and he thinks that this problem can be solved by adding a disclaimer. So to get rid of these useless disclaimers, we&rsquo;ll have to educate your boss.</p>
<p>Explain them the possible conflicts caused by disclaimers as I described above.</p>
<p>And tell them that the value of disclaimers is limited, since the courts normally attach more weight to the substantive content of the communication and the circumstances in which it is made than to any disclaimer.</p>
<p>The real solution to his problem cannot be obtained by technology or legal disclaimers.</p>
<p>The real solution is about the people, so train them! Most companies have special communication trainings for the phone support staff, why not do the same thing for those people communicating by e-mail? And of course you have customer relations guidelines for email, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>And if your boss is not listening to you, there is one more option: fight them with their own means! Each time I receive a message containing a disclaimer, I add the following disclaimer to my replies:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This disclaimer is just as ridiculous as any other disclaimer, and has no legal value. But it might show the uselessness of disclaimers to people using them.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->La Pelota Vasca<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a documentary movie about the situation in the Basque Country.</p>
<p>In this movie, a lot of people involved with (both sides of) the situation like politicians, musicians, professors and victims are interviewed to give a view of how hopeless the situation is.</p>
<p>Two important groups are absent: the party currently governing Spain (PP) and the ETA; exactly the two groups who could make a difference in the situation.</p>
<p>I saw this movie last Saturday and was very impressed and decided to write about it on my site. But of course I did not have time for it, so I forgot it until I saw the news yesterday.</p>
<p>The PP has the opinion that the movie gives a one-sided view of the problem (mainly because they refused to participate in the first place), and is doing everything they can to prevent people from watching this movie.</p>
<p>So when this week a British film festival decided to show the movie, Spain withdrawed their yearly support for this festival to bring the festival into financial problems.</p>
<p>I was amazed to hear that a modern country which considers freedom of speech one of the basic human rights is trying to prevent British festival visitors from seeing another opinion than the government&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In the same news block I heard the news that the government refuses to talk with the governor of the Basque Country about his plans for a better relation between the central government and the autonomous regions.</p>
<p>So they do not only refuse his plans, but refuse to talk with him at all!!!! Once again, I cannot believe some of the things this government is doing, and getting away with.</p>
<p>If you ever get the chance to watch ‚ÄòLa pelota vasca‚Äô, do it quickly. Though a little bit depressed, it certainly is worth your time. And you&rsquo;re teasing the Spanish government at the same time!!!</p>

			 <p>I like computers‚Ä¶ as long as they work.</p>
<p>But lately I&rsquo;ve had too much problems with them. I still didn&rsquo;t have time to fix them all, so the cover of my PC lies next to my computer, and my desk is full with computer parts and little screws. People knowing me a little bit can imagine my feelings about this, since I always prefer to work in a clean and organized environment.</p>
<p>The problems started when the hosting provider for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> had been taken over by another company, and the server migrated to a new platform. As a result, our scripts were broken, and SSI worked in another way, so we had to change the extension of all files. All in all a lot of work, which I still haven&rsquo;t completely finished.</p>
<p>Besides that, I can only download the access logs from a password protected site, almost impossible to automate. I have contacted the support desk many times, but answers are typically slow. Anyway, for the moment things are almost running as before again, but we will surely move to another provider after the current paid term expires.</p>
<p>While I was working hard to fix all the problems described above, the hard disk of my own computer started having problems. Each time after working for about half an hour, the disk started making an awful noise and the computer halted. After waiting an hour, I could start up the computer again for another thirty minutes of work.</p>
<p>In the cooling down period, I used my laptop computer, which also has some problems since I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dropped it on the floor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I cannot use it while the batteries are recharging, and the batteries only last for (again) thirty minutes.</p>
<p>You have to know that both computers are very old, my desktop is seven years old and my laptop probably 8. You could say that they are way too old, but I disagree.</p>
<p>My desktop with its Cyrix P133+ processor is more than fast enough for me, since all I do is read my e-mail, visit some web pages (no problem as long is you don&rsquo;t have Flash installed), and create HTML and CSS files.</p>
<p>Anyway, since I just bought a new computer for my in-laws, I took their old machine, took out the hard disk and started installing.</p>
<p>At this moment I have installed just the basics to start working again: Windows 98SE, Microsoft Office, HTML-kit, TopStyle Pro, WS_FTP Pro, Mozilla Firebird and Mozilla Thunderbird.</p>
<p>It is not ready yet, I still have to install Trillian, Acrobat Reader and Xenu Link Sleuth, and there is some more configuration to be done.</p>
<p>But at least I am working again. And after all, that&rsquo;s why I have a computer, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A List Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> resource for the latest trends in web design. Today the third version of their site became available, with no more than three new articles.</p>
<p>How disappointed was I when I noticed that they use a fixed width for their pages, a really small font by default, a font colour that lacks contrast and that some parts of the text are rendered unreadable with the blue background instead of white. I don&rsquo;t know whether the last problem is a bug in Firebird or a coding problem, since it disappears when I reload the page.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Imagine that I would have a lot of spare time. And imagine that I still remember how to program applications, and know all the ins and outs of Perl, PHP or Python. Imagine all that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>If all that would be true, I would create a Content Management System. A CMS is an application in which you can enter your texts in a very easy manner, and after that the application does all sorts of things with permissions, rules and templates to create for example a web site and/or a PDF document.</p>
<p>One example of a CMS is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I use to create this site. I only have to enter the text of my article, and MT creates a page with this text and a comment form, adds a summary to the main page, updates the monthly archive overview, etc.</p>
<p>MT is made especially for sites that post texts in a chronological order. There are also other types of CMS applications like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MMBase<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for multimedia content and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for general content. There are many CMS systems out there, so why do I want to create another one?</p>
<p>Simple because the CMS I am looking for does not exist.
I am not looking for this site, I am perfectly happy with MT, but I am looking for a solution for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This site is basically a collection or relatively statically documents, which are ordered in folders. Something very simple.</p>
<p>What I am looking for is a tool that gives the users a simple screen in which they can enter their text, and something to specify its location. After saving, the tool should automatically create the folders and add the new document in the navigation menus.</p>
<p>I know that there are some CMS applications that can do this, but I am looking for something very easy to configure and use, without spending months tweaking my application.</p>
<p>The best example I have is Microsoft FrontPage. Although it produces horrible code, they do have an easy way to manage your site with their organizational chart view. I only have to select the parent page, press the Insert button, change the name and start typing my text.</p>
<p>It is that way of working that I am looking for, only implemented as a server-based CMS system, so I can work from every computer. I also don&rsquo;t want to work in preview mode, but just enter my text in a text box with a limited set of buttons to add some basic mark-up (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Textile<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?). I can imagine starting from a sitemap page to enter new pages, or adding an ‚ÄòEdit‚Äô and ‚ÄòAdd new page‚Äô button to pages when a user is logged in.</p>
<p>If this solution would be easy enough to set up, I can imagine that a lot of hobby sites, local clubs, churches and schools would start using it; in fact, everybody with a basic site made with FrontPage.</p>
<p>The template system could be set up like in Movable Type, specifying different templates for different types of content. Of course it would come with a basic set of predefined document types (agenda, product description, event, news,&hellip;) and several style sheets to choose from.</p>
<p>Yes, if I really had a lot of time and programming knowledge, I would create such a CMS. Or does it already exist????</p>

<p>There are many ways to keep contact with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>By far the best way is to meet them in a bar, drinking a beer together. Unfortunately, this is not always a viable solution, so I also make use of electronics to keep contact.</p>
<p>Number two on my list is the good ol' phone, which has the benefit of meta-communication (emotions, emphasis,‚Ä¶) over the other electronic methods.</p>
<p>Then I use of course the internet to communicate, I am using e-mail (more personal), Usenet newsgroups (good for technical problems) and this site.</p>
<p>However, it might take a while before I receive feedback to the things I express using these media. Then we have the two I&rsquo;s: IRC and IM. The first I use when I have a technical problem that needs to be fixed urgently, the second for all personal communication for which using the telephone would be overkill.</p>
<p>Considering IM, at work I use Microsoft Messenger a lot. We have a lot of contacts abroad, and small companies are not able to hang on the phone to talk with the other side of the world for half the day.</p>
<p>Since we are basically a Microsoft shop, and most people have Messenger already installed on their machines, we are using this.</p>
<p>Personally, I am not a big fan of Messenger, mainly because you have no option of connecting without giving away your e-mail address. For business use this is no problem, but for my personal use, I prefer a solution that does not give away more than strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Until I moved to Spain I have been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ICQ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at home, and today I started using it again to be able to solve some problems on the fimcap site.</p>
<p>So back to ICQ! I installed the Lite version at home, and everywhere else I can use the web version. For those people who also use ICQ: my number is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11807773<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Everybody else can use my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Messaging Center<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to send me a message when I&rsquo;m on-line.</p>

<p>Visitors using older browsers like IE might have noticed that I recently started serving advertisements through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>People using more modern browsers as Mozilla or Firebird might not have noticed this, since these advertisements are not visible for them.

<p>The errors that you were experiencing last night were due to an AdSense system upgrade yesterday evening. This upgrade unfortunately created some technical difficulties and were temporarily unable to serve ads to sites in certain browsers. Not all browsers were effected.</p>
<p>However, our engineers have identified the problem, and I am happy to inform you that the issue is now resolved. Ads are now running on AdSense websites and you should not be seeing these errors anymore.</p>
<p>We value you as an AdSense publisher, and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused you. If you are continuing to have problems with this or have any other questions or concerns, please let us know by replying to this email. One of our AdSense specialists would be happy to assist you. Thank you for your patience in this matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Google Team<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of course I answered them that the problem still exists, but until now I haven&rsquo;t received an answer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update 2003.09.26]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Answer from Google:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thank you for writing us about this issue you are experiencing with your AdSense code. Unfortunately we are unable to replicate this problem. We taking your page, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://braintags.com/archives/2003/08/applicationxhtmlxml/">http://braintags.com/archives/2003/08/applicationxhtmlxml/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and running it through the W3C&rsquo;s XML validator tool ( <a href="http://validator.w3.org/)">http://validator.w3.org/)</a>, we find that the entire page including our JavaScript code is currently XML complaint. (See Results: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2Farchives%2F2003%2F08%2Fapplicationxhtmlxml%2F">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2Farchives%2F2003%2F08%2Fapplicationxhtmlxml%2F</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Unfortunately we are unable to replicate this problem you are experiencing.</p>
<p>From previous emails it appears you state you are having this problem in Mozilla 1.4. Here is a list of browsers that supports our code <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/faq-tech#q10">https://www.google.com/adsense/faq-tech#q10</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Are there other browsers on this list that you are having difficulty with? Also can you include a screenshot of the error since we are unable to replicate this problem on our end. Please include any additional information you may find may be useful in helping to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Google Team<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It looks like they don&rsquo;t understand anything about specifying the MIME type when sending a page, so I send the following reply.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I know that my page is XML compliant, that surely is not the problem.</p>
<p>You have not been able to replicate the problem, because you have not used a gecko-based browser. Normally I send my pages with MIME type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text/html<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is what IE and the W3C validator get. Only to browsers which tell me in their request headers that they accept the MIME type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (like Mozilla and Firebird), I use this MIME type to send my files.</p>
<p>Note that even though the validator did not complain, I did not send it a valid page, since the specification tells that XHTML1.1 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be delivered as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>To reproduce the error, just visit my page with Mozilla or Firebird, and you will see that the AdSense box will not appear. The only screenshot I can send you is the JavaScript console, but it only contains the two
messages I have send before.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update 2003.10.01]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> And finally Google realises that their script is not working:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We appreciate your taking the time to offer us this feedback and encourage you to continue to let us know how we can improve Google AdSense. As AdSense is still a young program, new features are under consideration and your feedback is very helpful. This information has been passed on to our engineers and they will look into allowing our ads to be served in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pages.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
The Google Team<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It took them almost a month (I reported this problem on September 4<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to realise that something is wrong. Let&rsquo;s see how long it will take them to fix this problem.</p>

			 <p>So many things to do, and only 24 hours in a day. I guess everybody sometimes has the feeling that too many things lie around unfinished.</p>
<p>For me, these are some small, usually technical, things as fixing the stylesheet of this site so the menu appears on the right place in IE, converting this site to PHP (so I can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->degrade<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pages to XHTML1.0 for IE), fix the light in the stairway, reading hundreds of pages I have bookmarked lately, look for a new computer for my in-laws, build a wireless network at home, put the latest Link on the Fimcap site, paint our front door, learn how to use ZOPE for future use for Fimcap, install freeBSD on my laptop‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Looking at this list, I wonder where all my time is going. Lets see: 9 hours sleeping, 9 hours working, 1.5 hours household (cooking, cleaning, ironing), 2.5 quality time (hours drinking beers on a terrace, watching TV on the sofa, reading the newspaper), 1 hour taking care about myself (eating &amp; shower)‚Ä¶ that leaves me 1 hour each day to be productive!

			 <p>I use this site a lot for testing out things. You could say that this site is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forever under construction<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Today I have been testing again, and as a result, it looks more horrible in Internet Explorer. And since I am going on holidays, I am not going to fix it until next week. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>I have been working on the menu. The whole page header is situated inside a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;div&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with an inline ordered list with bottom border as menu. Until today, I did nothing to position the menu, which resulted that the menu walked outside the header if you changed the font size. Not too beautiful‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So today I relatively positioned the header, and specified an absolute position of the menu, so it is always at the border of the containing positioned element, the header.</p>
<p>It solves the problem perfectly, but not in IE. I tested the new stylesheet in IE6, and the menu appeared at the bottom of the screen instead of the bottom of the header. I don&rsquo;t know yet why IE is behaving like this, but promise to look further into it next week.</p>

			 <p>If you are creating (X)HTML code, you always have to make sure that you use the right elements to specify the meaning of certain parts of the text. After that you can use stylesheets to determine how these parts will look. This is what they call the semantics of the text.</p>
<p>A lot of web designers abuse tags to accomplish a certain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If they want a bigger text, they use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;h2&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> element, while the text is not a header at all, if they want to indent a text, they use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;blockquote&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, even though they are not quoting. I won&rsquo;t go into detail why this is a bad thing, there are plenty of resources explaining this better than I could.
But a lot of designers like me who try to do it correctly still make some mistakes. Today I realised that my pages have two semantically errors:</p>
<p>For my navigation lists, I use‚Äîas many other sites‚Äîunordered lists (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;XXX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). But my navigation links <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have an order! My archive links are ordered chronological, so the correct thing would be to use the ordered list (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;XXX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) instead.</p>
<p>By default, an ordered list is shown with numbers in front of each item, but it is very easy to remove them, just as I removed the bullets from my unordered navigation lists. I have seen many sites doing this wrong, and most examples of you will find on internet also use unordered lists.</p>
<p>Another thing I thought about today is that when I display trackbacks (comments on another site about my text) I am quoting another site. Therefore, I should be using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;blockquote&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> element (or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;q&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I have looked around at other sites, but nowhere have I found trackbacks marked up as quotes.</p>
<p>You might think that these are minor issues, but since I am rewriting my templates anyway, I better do it right, not?</p>

			 <p>The moment I changed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of this site, I also changed the version of the code used for these pages.</p>
<p>My site is now made up in XHTML version 1.1. I only forgot to change one thing.</p>
<p>I did change some elements to their new variants, and of course I included the right DTD. But my pages were still served to your browser with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text/html<!-- raw HTML omitted --> MIME type, while the specification tells me that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should<!-- raw HTML omitted --> serve my pages as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The specification is quite clear in this, but as usual the reality is more complicated. I could simple change the file extensions to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.xhtml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which are automatically send with the right MIME type. But at this moment a lot of browsers (including IE6) are not able to handle this kind of documents.</p>
<p>So I need to distinguish browsers that can handle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application/xhtml+xml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from those that cannot handle it. Fortunately, most browsers send a list of MIME types they can handle each time they request a file from the server; so all I have to do is look at this list, and change the MIME type for modern browsers.</p>
<p>Therefore I added the following lines to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.htaccess<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} application/xhtml+xml
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} !application/xhtml+xml\s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->;\s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->q=0
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .html$
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} HTTP/1.1
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !photos.braintags.com
RewriteRule .* - [T=application/xhtml+xml]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The first line looks whether the MIME type is in the accepted list of the browser.</p>
<p>The second lines looks whether it does not have q=0 (q stands for quality), which means that the browser does not want to use this MIME type.</p>
<p>The third line limits the requests to .html files only, since we do not want to change the MIME type for images, stylesheets and other files.</p>
<p>The fourth line limits the requests to HTTP version 1.1.</p>
<p>The fifth line excludes my photo pages, since I haven&rsquo;t updated them to XHTML1.1 yet.</p>
<p>And the last line finally specifies the right MIME type for requests that satisfy all conditions above.</p>

			 <p>Today I noticed something strange in the access report of this site. In the error codes list I found error 411.</p>
<p>Since I haven&rsquo;t seen this error code before, I googled on internet for some more information.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->official RFC 2616<!-- raw HTML omitted --> says the following: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body in the request message.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It appears that a server is returning code 411 when a client (=browser) tries to send data to the server without specifying the size of the data. Normally a client only receives data from the server (reading pages), and all common modern browsers are programmed in such a way that they include the data length when sending data.</p>
<p>Therefore I suspected that somebody with a home-grown application had tried to mess with my site.
I did a quick grep in my Apache log files and found out that somebody had accessed the file mt-xmlrpc.cgi with an application that identified itself as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Java/1.4.1_01<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This file is a XML-RPC interface to Movable Type, allowing other applications to interact with MT, for example to publish entries on this site from a special desktop client.</p>
<p>Since I am the only responsible for this site, nobody but me has any reason to use this file. This visitor also triggered my Spam trap, and was already blocked from my system, but if not, his badly programmed application did ring the alarm bell.</p>

			 <p>First a question for the music industry: ‚ÄúWhat the heck are you doing?‚Äù</p>
<p>Yesterday MJ gave me a present; the CD Fleshwounds from Skin.</p>
<p>Of course I was really happy with it, but I immediately noticed a big label on both sides with the words COPY CONTROLLED. In the specifications I read that this CD would work in any CD-player, the latest Macs and PCs with minimal Pentium II, 233 MHz and 64MB RAM. I am perfectly happy with my Cyrix P133+ with 48MB RAM, and until now I was able to play any CD I liked.</p>
<p>Of course I tried to play the CD, but my computer could not find the CD. üôÅ</p>
<p>I really like buying CD&rsquo;s; I prefer to buy one to using a copied CD. Because for me the CD is more than just the disk with the bits and bytes. I like to look at the artwork in the booklet, and no inkjet printed paper gives me the same feeling as the original CD.</p>
<p>And because I usually buy older CD&rsquo;s, I never feel that I pay a lot; of course I wouldn&rsquo;t complain if they became cheaper.</p>
<p>So I buy the original CD&rsquo;s because of the better quality of the total product.</p>
<p>But now the record companies are throwing in their own windows, because they decrease the quality of their product. And why would I want to pay a lot for something that is broken?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any problem yet, since there are so many old CD&rsquo;s out there that I still want to buy. But I can assure that I am never ever going to buy a copy protected CD anymore. Not because I want to copy it, which I feel is my right, but because it is essentially a broken product.</p>
<p>You can read more about copy-protected CD&rsquo;s at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kuro5hin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or if you truely want to know everything you can go to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the UK campain for Digital Rights<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Most viruses that replicate themselves through e-mail forge the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> field of their messages. Usually they take a random address, or pick one from your address book or web cache. Therefore, a virus appearing to come from <a href="mailto:jeroen@example.com">jeroen@example.com</a>, rarely really originates from this address.</p>
<p>I can image that some users don&rsquo;t know this, and when they receive a virus from me they send me a reply with a warning that I have a virus.</p>
<p>Usually I explain these people the story above and tell them, of course after checking that my anti-virus software is up-to-date, that I don&rsquo;t have a virus. No problem for me.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is that some people who are responsible for really big mail servers also don&rsquo;t understand that viruses forge headers, and have their servers configured in such a way that they reply to me.</p>
<p>Of course they have the right to block a message with a virus to protect their customers. But please don&rsquo;t bother me with these messages. I can assure you that I am not the one sending these messages; just check the mail headers and you will see that they originate from a completely different server.</p>
<p>This morning somebody who apparently had visited my site cached a virus and started sending out the virus in my name. Luckily for him, his provider scans all incoming SMTP mail and intercepted all messages.</p>
<p>Instead of simply not accepting these messages, they had configured procmail to send a warning to the address mentioned in the from-field (me) including the virus!!!!!</p>
<p>As a result, my inbox is flooded with viruses from this server (mail.infosys.tuwien.ac.at).</p>
<p>Once again, none of my computers is infected with a virus.</p>

			 <p>I have written before about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type plug-ins I use for this site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; at this moment I am using seven different plug-ins.</p>
<p>The more plug-ins you use, the more difficult it becomes to maintain the site. Because once in a while new versions appear, and I don&rsquo;t want to scan seven (eight if you include MT itself) sites to see if updates are available.</p>
<p>But now there is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MT Plug-ins Manager<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I downloaded the files, placed them on the server and fired up the page. A neat list with all available plug-ins appeared.</p>
<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t install my plug-ins with this tool, the plug-in manager did not know yet which plug-ins I already have installed. So I went to the Manual Registration section, where I could specify the version number and plug-in name of each file in my plugins directory.</p>
<p>After entering these details I went back to my main page, and noticed an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->update<!-- raw HTML omitted --> button next to the IfEmpty plug-in. I was using version 1.1, while the latest version is 1.11. I clicked the button, waited some seconds and my plug-in was updated.</p>
<p>This is great!!! No more downloading from different sites, unzipping, FTP-ing,‚Ä¶ One click on the button does the job.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday evening my parents arrived for a short holiday in our house. I came home from work a little bit late, so I had to run a little bit to be ready before they arrived. I cleaned the last things, ironed our clothes and prepared a spinach/salmon quiche and a salad with cheese and apple.</p>
<p>When MJ arrived with them, I showed them around in our house. My mother only had seen it before we started the reconstruction, and though my father had visited us in January, enough things have changed in the mean time.</p>
<p>At half past ten we started our supper, which was even for us a little bit late. Fortunately my parents had eaten some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->krentenbollen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (anybody knows the translation?) in the airplane. After supper we talked a little bit and we showed them our holiday photo&rsquo;s from Croatia.</p>
<p>This morning before going to work, I prepared the table for breakfast. While they were eating, I gave them our map of Lleida and explained them where our house is and where they can find interesting things. I also explained them how to make coffee and gave them the keys of the house. I am sure that they will be alright.</p>

			 <p>Some of you receive a message whenever I update this site. You can become a member of my update list by filling in your details on the form on my first page. I am using an external service (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloglet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to handle these messages.</p>
<p>But now that I have my new provider, I am taking things in my own hands again. I have created a MailMan mailing list to which I will add all people receiving messages .

<p>Movable Type supports a notification list, but has no mechanism to manage this list. I will have to add, remove and change all addresses by hand, and since I am lazy I looked for a way to automate this. So now the only e-mail address in the MT notification list is the mailing list address. After that, MailMan will take care about distributing the message to all interested persons.</p>
<p>MailMan also provides a management interface where the recipients of my messages can configure their accounts.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update 12.08.2003]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†The test performed by this message worked flawlessly, so I deleted the Bloglet service and replaced the subscription form by a MailMan form.

			 <p>It has been three days ago since I switched my site to the new server. Little by little the visitors switched as DNS servers synchronised all over the world. And little by little I noticed some problems on my site.</p>
<p>These problems were related the two changes I made in the set-up of my site: I moved my photo gallery from its subdirectory <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/photos<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to its own sub-domain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->photos.braintags.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I changed all URLs of the individual archives from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entry_name.html<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entry_name/index.shtml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The first change broke all links to the photos (and what is a photo gallery without photos?) which I corrected by editing all 51 entries. Furthermore I still have to create a symbolic link to some files from my main site, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->robots.txt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The second change broke nothing on my site, but some links to my pages on other sites (Google!) broke terribly. Therefore I decided to us my good friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mod_rewrite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to serve people the right page. All I had to do was to create a rule to redirect requests for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/archives/yyyy/mm/entry_name.html<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/archives/yyyy/mm/entry_name/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So I created the following rule:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --># Redirect old URI&rsquo;s to future-proof directories
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule (archives/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/.*).html$ $1/ [R=permanent]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This did a good job, except for two problems: it also redirected the URI of my monthly archives to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->archives/yyyy/mm/index/<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it added a slash in front of the URI, so the URL would look like <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://jeroensangers.com//archives/">http://jeroensangers.com//archives/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Ä¶ The first problem was easily solved:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --># Redirect old URI&rsquo;s to future-proof directories
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !index.s?html$
RewriteRule (archives/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/.*).html$ $1/ [R=permanent]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>For the second problem I am still looking for a solution.</p>

			 <p>Change of plans‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Yesterday I told that I was going to redesign my templates and style before switching to the new hosting provider. After one day of design work, I realise that I want so many changes that the rewrite is going to take weeks.</p>
<p>The style I was using until now was based on the default templates of Movable Type, which I adapted by adding and deleting some things, until it looked <!-- raw HTML omitted -->almost<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like what I wanted. What I am doing now, is starting with an empty file and adding one by one the elements I want to see. This is a slowly process, since I cannot spend the whole day working on this‚ÄîI wish I could!</p>
<p>So now I decided that I am going to copy everything as it is now to the new location, and continue the rewrite on the background. Therefore I disabled comments on the most popular entries (to disable comments on all entries I need to edit them one-by-one. There is a script that can do this, but is requires PHP and MySQL, two of the reasons I am switching to another provider).</p>
<p>Now I have to copy the templates and do an export and import of the data. If everything works well, you will read the next message from the new server.</p>

			 <p>After I purchased an account for this site last weekend, I have been exploring the possibilities and planning how to switch my site to the new server. I prefer to think a little bit before I start copying recklessly.</p>
<p>The thing that took most of my time is making choices, since I have now so many more options than I had before. For example, I have three options to access my e-mail with a web client (NeoMail, horde or SquirrelMail), and three options to analyse the access statistics (AWStats, webalizer, Urchin).</p>
<p>Besides making choices, I have been experimenting on setting up a mailing list for the notifications, created a subdomain for my photo gallery, blocked some IP addresses, activated SpamAssasin on my e-mail, ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>All these options are comfortably available through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cPanel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, something I have never seen before, but which I liked immediately.</p>
<p>Of course I started installing Movable Type, this time using a MySQL database to store all the information.</p>
<p>This gave me also the opportunity to play a little bit with MySQL. After setting up MT, I configured my three weblogs (Braintags, Braintags Gallery and Braintags Static Content), but did not yet copy the style sheets. I want to use this site conversion to update all my templates and styles. I am thinking about using a three-column layout for my main page, since the current sidebar is too long.</p>
<p>Besides that, I want to integrate my photo gallery by using a likewise style. So the next week I will be playing HTML-Kit and TopStyle Pro.</p>
<p>Once this is done, I will export and import all the date and change the DNS record so you all can see the new site (without pop-up banners!!).</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t notice the pop-up advertisements on this site anymore, since the browsers I am normally using (Mozilla &amp; Firebird) block them, but I know that they irritate quite some visitors of this site.</p>
<p>But as they say: you get what you pay for. I pay nothing for hosting this site, and in return I&rsquo;ll have to accept that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my provider<!-- raw HTML omitted --> adds these horrible things to my pages. üôÅ</p>
<p>But I have good news for you: today I arranged a new hosting provider, and since I am paying a little bit, they will host my site banner free!!!!!!. I could have upgraded my current account, but I have found a provider who gives me a lot more for less!!!</p>
<p>Here are the specs:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For me, the biggest advancements are the MySQL database, unlimited POP3 boxes and PHP. I don&rsquo;t know anything about PHP, but I have seen a lot of handy code that I would like to copy &amp; paste in my templates.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that without the banner code, my pages will contain valid XHTML 1.1 code.</p>
<p>For the coming period, I&rsquo;m afraid that I will still serve my site from the old location with pop-ups, since I want to set up the new server really, really good, and like to fix some design flaws in the current site.</p>

			 <p>M√°r √ñrlygsson has written a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->howto<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on creating ‚Äòfuture-proof‚Äô URLs in Movable type.</p>
<p>In short, he suggests storing individual archives at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.example.com/archive/2003/06/17/12.35.57/">http://www.example.com/archive/2003/06/17/12.35.57/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The archive file will be called index.html.</p>
<p>I like this idea, since it will allow me to change my site, without having to change my URLs. If for example one day I decide to use PHP in my pages, all I have to do is change the template and create index.php files. Since the URL&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t change, no links break.</p>
<p>Some day I might try to implement this, but I won&rsquo;t use the directory structure M√°r proposes (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/yyyy/mm/dd/hh.mm/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). He doesn&rsquo;t use the title in the URL, since he writes in Icelandic, which has some ‚Äòstrange‚Äô characters. I write in English, so I don&rsquo;t have that problem.</p>
<p>The other problem M√°r describes is that the location of the file changes if you change the title. This is true, but I also think that you think first before you post, and choose the best title possible. I have never changed a title of a post afterwards, and am not planning to do so in the future. I do see that this might be a small risk.</p>
<p>I also won&rsquo;t use a directory-level for the day. Not only because I don&rsquo;t post that much, but even if in the future I start posting three entries each day, the 90 files per directory won&rsquo;t be a big problem. The benefit of keeping the URL short and clear is more important for me.</p>
<p>When I want to reread a message, I often just type in the URL. I can&rsquo;t always remember the exact day, but usually I know the month and the title of the post. With these two bits of information, I can quickly look up a page. So I‚Äôll opt for URI&rsquo;s like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/archives/yyyy/mm/title_of_the_post/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Today I finished entering my photo&rsquo;s (51 in total) to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->photo log<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You won&rsquo;t find any new photo&rsquo;s there; all these photo&rsquo;s have been available on my site for a long time already.</p>
<p>The benefits of this whole operation are that my photo&rsquo;s can now have more than one category, the navigation is more intuitive and that you now have the ability to leave comments on photo&rsquo;s (I implemented the photo log in MT). Besides that, it will be easier to maintain the whole thing, since I control my whole site with a single tool.</p>
<p>Now that this is ready, I have only two things left to do: remove the old Image Gallery and forward request for its pages to the new location, and restyle the photo log according to the style of the rest of the site. The first thing I will do today, the second one may take several months.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update 31.07.2003]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I just removed Image Gallery and changed my .htaccess file to redirect all requests to my photo log.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That makes 23, amazing!!!</p>
<p>Of course you can always discuss about the definition of an OS.

I have been thinking to group all flavours of Unix (including Linux) in one group, but than I would also have to group all flavours of Windows. Fact is that the different Unices can be very different from each other, so I left them alone.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I mentioned them yesterday: the not yet so famous band <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apesjit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Why Apesjit? Sure, they are not the greatest band I know, but they are nice guys, certainly funny and play quite well. In short, they deserve some promotion and I gladly reserve a small spot on my site for them.</p>
<p>The first time I met Apesjit was in 1999 when we went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nirwana<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tuinfeest, a small festival in Lierop. We didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, but after seeing Apesjit on Saturday early in the afternoon, we knew that we would have a great weekend. What a show!!!</p>
<p>Of course we immediately bought some t-shirts and after that directly to the band to complain about the text on the shirt. This was the case: they tried to convince us that you have to pronounce the band name as in English: Ape-shit. However, the spelling of their name is definitely Dutch (and their lyrics are Dutch as well), so we continued pronouncing the name in Dutch. Part of the t-shirt contained a dictionary page, explaining what Apesjit is, and according to the band we could see there how to pronounce it: Eip&ndash;‚à´jit. We told the band to make up their minds and choose between their Apeshit or Eipfjit. Until that moment we will continue using the Dutch pronunciation.</p>
<p>After that first concert we have travelled several times to the far south of the Netherlands to see them (on stage or looking side by side to other bands), and we even arranged a concert for them in Harmelen.</p>
<p>Now that I live in Lleida, I cannot visit them anymore. I surely would have liked to see their performance at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zwarte cross<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where they played from a truck driving over the cross track. And surely they will be present at the coming Tuinfeest festival; not to play, but to enjoy the music and drink some beer.</p>
<p>If I want to see them again, I will just have to wait until they are famous enough to do an European tour. Until that moment; all I can do is give them some publicity‚Ä¶</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the years, the emphasis of my site has changed a lot.</p>
<p>I started a personal site mainly to experiment with this new phenomenon. First I created a list with hyperlinks, mainly to sites about the Internet and sites about music.</p>
<p>After that I added some info about myself and started writing a sort of diary.</p>
<p>Later I was able to export data from my CD database, so everybody could see which CD&rsquo;s I own. Besides experimenting with databases, I did this because I think that someone&rsquo;s music preferences tells a lot about the person, and makes it easier to identify the writer.</p>
<p>Just before moving to Lleida, I created a completely new site with stories and photo&rsquo;s from my life over here. Now, 20 months later, I am looking at my site, and feel that something is missing. This site does not swing, it does not rock and it does not dance. This site misses music!!!!</p>
<p>The only fragment of music on this site is the link to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ApeSjit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my blogroll.</p>
<p>Listening to music is one of my greatest hobbies; the moment I come home I turn on the radio or put a CD. Since this site is about me, it needs music. Therefore I created a new category, so I will be stimulated to write about music.</p>
<p>In the future I will try to add my CD database again, but I want it to be completely automated, since the old solution needed a lot of manual copy and paste work. And maybe I will add the ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Currently listening to<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô feature so many other sites show.</p>
<p>This site is going to rock!!! :-D</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: this site is not receiving a lot of visitors.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have the feeling that I am the only one reading my texts. And I know exactly why. The main reason is that this site is not so interesting. And that is because I am not a great writer.</p>
<p>That sounds really pessimistic, but in my opinion it is realistic. My style of writing has been created at school; due to my education I mainly write down the ‚Äòcold facts‚Äô, and try to use as less words as possible, while the sites I like to read are funny, well-written, poetic, ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The other problem this site suffers from is the subjects. I mainly write about two subjects: my life in Lleida, which is only interesting to the people who know me, and some technological news, which van also be found on a thousand other sites.</p>
<p>But I am like this, and this is my site. Even though not a lot of people are reading my writings, I really appreciate the people who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> take the time to read it.</p>
<p>Because they are interested in my life now that I am living far away. Or because they are interested in some technological information I have been writing about (I hope that you could use the information I gave you). Or because they accidentally came here looking for something that is nor here (most people arriving on my site through a search engine are looking for Spanish curse words or serial numbers). No matter why they are visiting this site, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>But still, deep in my heart I keep hoping that one day this site will have a group of enthusiastic regular readers posting comments on the things I write.</p>
<p>To make this dream come true, I only have to do one thing: write better, more interesting texts. I&rsquo;ve got work to do!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great tool for creating personal sites (and some other types of sites as well), mainly due to its flexible template system and its many features like trackback, image upload &amp; write functionality, sanitising,‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Regular readers (are there any?) of this site know that I did not need a lot of time to set up this site. However, I still keep on tweaking parts of the site to make it even better. It started with converting the templates from XHTML 1.0 to XHTML 1.1. After that I moved a little bit around with the different items shown on the pages, and adjusted the style sheet.</p>
<p>And soon I ran into the limits of Movable Type. Some things are simple not possible, are they? Fortunately, I am never the only one facing the limitations, and usually one of the guru&rsquo;s out there solved the problem for me, always with a plugin.</p>
<p>Plugins are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feature making MT such a great tool. If MT cannot do it, there is always a plugin that can do it for you!!!</p>
<p>The following list describes the plugins I am using at the moment, and why I am using them:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->BlogCopyright<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I could have created the functionality of this plugin by using a template module, but this is simply easier. BlogCopyright automatically creates the copyright message at the bottom of each page. It uses the year of the first and the last post and the author of the first message on the page. This means that I don&rsquo;t have to change anything when we enter the year 2004.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ifEmpty<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is more a programmers tool. It allows me to hide certain elements when they are empty. I use it in the definition of the file location of my Static Contents section. There, the category gives me the directory in which the file is placed. If there is no category, the file has to be placed in the root of the site.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->macros<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Another tool to automate things. I use this plugin to create automatically the right code for some common abbreviations and acronyms. For example, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> becomes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;abbr title=&ldquo;Movable Type&rdquo;&gt;MT&lt;/abbr&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. By the way, the macros are automatically created from a short list using the MTPerlScript plugin (idea shamelessly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stolen from Mark Pilgrim<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->otherblog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Normally the sections are completely separated; you cannot access data like the name or the contents from an entry from outside a section. I am using a special section to manage my static contents, but would like to use some elements like the banner from my main section in the templates of the static contents. This plugin allows me to do this.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->perlscript<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Again a very low-level plugin. This plugin allows me to execute Perl scripts from my templates. I use it to create my yearly archive pages, since MT only offers monthly archives. I am writing since 1997, so the list of monthly archives is way too long, therefore I created the yearly archive pages.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->simplecomments<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
There are two ways to react to my writings: you can leave a comment, or you can write about it on your own site and notify me using TrackBack. By default, MT keeps them separated, providing a list of comments and a list of trackbacks. In my point of view, comments and trackbacks are basically the same, but in different places. Therefore, I prefer to have a single comments list, with both the comments residing on my site as the comments written on other sites. SimpleComments does this for me.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->smartypants<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Smartypants fixes the typographic punctuation of my entries. It converts straight quotes ( &quot; and ' ) into ‚Äúcurly‚Äù quote HTML entities, dashes (‚Äú<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äù and ‚Äú<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äù) into en- and em-dash entities and three consecutive dots (‚Äú<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äù) into an ellipsis entity. Just to make it more perfect‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>A month ago, I wrote about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shortcomings of Internet Explorer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and how this might stop innovation on the Internet in the coming years.</p>
<p>All over the web, people have expressed their worries, and a lot of web designers are afraid to have to deal with an obsolete browser for many many years. And of course, an action has been started to convince users to switch to another browser: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Use a Better Browser<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They ask site owners to place a button on their site, linked to a page explaining why other browsers are better than IE.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although I agree with them that IE is quickly becoming a dinosaur, I don&rsquo;t think that a button will let many users change their browser. However, they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will<!-- raw HTML omitted --> change because of (lack of) features. If other browsers have features IE does not have, users might switch.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best way to convince IE-users to show them the tabbed browser interface and pop-up blocking of Mozilla and create sites using code that is not supported by IE.</p>
<p>Of course, degrade gracefully. Something as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->position:fixed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> CSS property can serve for this purpose, for example for creating a floating navigation bar which will always be visible on the top of the screen. IE users will simply have to scroll up to navigate (as always), while visitors with newer browsers will have the benefits of having the navigation always at hand.</p>
<p>Other features that can be used to create better sites, are described in Eric Meyer&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->css/edge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These won&rsquo;t work on IE, but won&rsquo;t make the page unusable.</p>
<p>So go ahead, design your pages using the latest coding possibilities, but degrade gracefully!!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A while ago, I explained how I configured the server to return <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HTTP Error 410: Gone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for all requests for pages created with my old CMS.</p>
<p>After installing Movable Type, all pages of my site moved to another location, and I was not able to work out the new location of the files. In short, error 410 says: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The requested file used to exist on this location, but it has gone to an unknown location<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This message is more clear than the message returned by default; the famous 404.</p>
<p>I always check the server logs for 404 messages, since it might indicate that a link on the site is wrong and I&rsquo;ll have to fix that. One of the files coming up regulary in that log is the default MT stylesheet styles-site.css, which I have replaced by my own stylesheet with a different name.</p>
<p>I immediately wanted to add this file to my ‚Äò410‚Äìlist‚Äô, but then I realised that 410 is not the correct code, since I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> know where the file went.</p>
<p>Therefore a better solution would be to return code 301 (permanent redirect) together with the new location, so any smart client would simply redirect to the new address.</p>
<p>To implement this, I only needed to add a single line to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.htaccess<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Redirect permanent /styles-site.css <a href="http://www.braintags.com/paz.css">http://www.braintags.com/paz.css</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This line tells the server to redirect requests for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/styles-site.css<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with code ‚Äòpermanent‚Äô to the file <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.braintags.com/paz.css">http://www.braintags.com/paz.css</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Remember that the destination always has to be a complete URL!!</p>

			 <p>After yesterdays post I started playing more with Movable Type.</p>
<p>I decided to move some static content from my site to a separate section, as described by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brad Choate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At that moment, the only static content I had were the HTML error pages, displayed in case somebody asks a non-existing page. These pages were implemented as index templates, but with the new method I can treat them as normal texts without having to edit HTML code. I also decided to move the Stylesheet templates to the new section, since they are hardly ever updated.</p>
<p>After entering the texts for the error documents, I ran into a problem. I wanted to use almost the same templates as I am using for the rest of the site, but these templates make use of template modules (text snippets), which are linked to a specific section. So I started looking for a solution to display information from one section into another. And I found exactly what I was looking for: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MTOtherBlog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>After this success I created some more static content (a Spambot trap), and fixed my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->search page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the MTOtherBlog plugin.</p>
<p>I am very happy with my MT static content solution. However, after this experience I realise that MT is not suited for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since it has too much static content in a more complex directory structure. This would mean that we have to create a seperate category for every subcategory, which would make it difficult to manage.</p>

			 <p>The buzz started with the redesign of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adaptive Path<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[stop]design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jay Allen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> blogger software to produce a commercial site. And not only as a CMS to publish their ‚ÄòAppearances‚Äô, ‚ÄòEssays‚Äô and ‚ÄòNews‚Äô, but also to manage the static content of the site! Jay Allen posted a description of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how he set up the Adaptive Path configuration<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Other people already had the same idea or started working after reading the above story. Doug Bowman of [stop]design started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->managing his portfolio<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with MT, Matt Haughey explains <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how to use MT in alternative ways<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, like creating an About page and using the database fields in different ways. He also lists some sites using MT this way.</p>
<p>And finally, master MT-hacker Brad Choate explains <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how to use the MT-categories to place static content in directories<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Managing static content with MT is definitely THE hype of this week!!!</p>
<p>I have been reading all this with a lot of interest. Already for a while Sebastiaan and I are thinking about a CMS for our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site, since this site is at this moment completely maintained by hand at HTML level.</p>
<p>We do use some Server Side Includes (SSI) to handle general content like the page headers and footers, and NewsPro for some content, but mostly we have to change the HTML code. This makes it also really difficult for others to contribute to the site, since they first have to understand HTML and the organisation of our site.</p>
<p>We have been looking around a while ago, and the best fit I could find at that moment was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but since Plone is so completely different from what we are doing now, this would involve a really steep learning curve.</p>
<p>But now it looks like we can do it in MT. We can manage our static content, create templates, and store our dynamical content. The only thing I have to figure out is how we can implement the site in three languages. I guess I will just set up a demo and start playing‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I have installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Thunderbird<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my computer.</p>
<p>Until now I was using Microsoft Outlook Express to handle my mail, but I was far from satisfied with it. I never have been a great fan of OE, but since my computer is very old (1997) with limited resources (Cyrix P150+, 48Mb RAM), I am very careful not installing too much heavy software on it. Therefore I stick with the default Windows applications as much as possible, unless they are completely unworkable.</p>
<p>A while ago I already switched from IE6 (which was almost as old as my computer) to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Firebird<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obvious reasons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I never looked back to Internet Explorer anymore.</p>
<p>Outlook Express was also close to unworkable for me. Its limited filtering, habit of creating bloated e-mail and top posting were bugging me all the time.</p>
<p>Time for a change, and my Mozilla experience lead me to Thunderbird. The only problem is that the Thunderbird project is still in a alpha stage, and therefore surely still contains some bugs. I decided to install it anyway, and until now I haven&rsquo;t found a single bug!</p>
<p>It feels a little bit slower than OE, but it certainly makes life a lot easier. I was able to import my Outlook Express address book and mail without problems, and was able to set up a (Bayesian) Spam filter in no time.</p>
<p>I still have to do some additional configuring like specifying the signatures and adding my certificates, but my experience so-far is more than positive!!!</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am receiving a lot of Spam, way too much‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The last years the amount of Spam I receive has been steadily growing, and now I receive about 50 messages per day. But I am not going to sit down and accept it; no, I am fighting Spam. I am fighting Spam because Spam takes away the pleasure and the functionality of a system I like and use a lot. Spam is about to destroy e-mail. I fight Spam in several ways, here is how‚Ä¶</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The most important thing is to make sure that spammers don&rsquo;t get your e-mail address.</p>
<p>I always try to avoid to fill in an e-mail address in guest books, forums and when requesting online information. If I do have to give my e-mail address, I always make sure I can track down the source.</p>
<p>I can do that, since I have my own domain. If I have to leave my address at example.com, I will use <a href="mailto:example.com@jeroensangers.com">example.com@jeroensangers.com</a>. The moment I start receiving Spam on this address, I can easily block it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have your own domain, this is not possible, but make always sure that you only put your address on-line if you really have to. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And never munge your address by adding something like NOSPAM!!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Spammers look for addresses on the Internet, but a lot of them are not used anymore. Therefore they try to verify that somebody is reading the mail; a verified address is worth more to the spammer.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to whitelist an e-mail address. The most common is the ‚ÄòRemove me from this list‚Äô message at the bottom of much Spam.</p>
<p>But instead of removing you from their Spam list, the spammer will put you on the verified addresses list, and you will surely receive more Spam. Therefore I never use these links to remove me from a Spam list.</p>
<p>The second method of white listing uses images. The spammer links to an image with a code in the filename, and when you open the message this image is loaded from the spammer&rsquo;s server. After that the spammer can check the code in the image name and your e-mail address is verified!</p>
<p>I usually use Mozilla mail, which let you select whether you want to view messages in HTML (including images) or as plain text. Although a lot of people send messages in HTML by default, few messages have content that NEED this, so I usually read my messages in plain text. (I also send my messages in plain text, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that is a different story<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). People using Outlook will have to disable their preview pane to prevent images from being loaded automatically.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>No matter how hard you try to prevent Spam, at a certain moment you will receive some, and it will never stop. In 99% of the cases you can easily recognise Spam from the sender and the subject, which are unknown, strange, in a foreign language and coded (texts like: jbkdk,bjhskda).</p>
<p>I always make sure to directly put Spam messages in a separate folder, so I can continue reading my regular mail, and deal with the Spam later. If you don&rsquo;t receive many messages, you can do this by hand, but lazy people like me like this to be automated.</p>
<p>The latest technology is based on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bayesian Filtering<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and luckily Mozilla has this technique integrated.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Depending on my time (usually not a lot), I send a complaint to the provider of the Spammer. I open up my Spam folder, analyse all messages and send a message to the provider of the originating mail server and sites mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find out who is the responsible, but fortunately this can be partly automated as well. I use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SpamCop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> notification service, to report Spam. SpamCop analyses the email, works out the likely true sender of the email, looks in the body to find any advertised email addresses or web sites, and then emails the administrators of all the systems involved to let them know about the problem.</p>
<p>SpamCop tells me whom the notification will be sent to, so I can remove any incorrectly targeted reports from the list.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This last one is quite obvious, but essential. Spammers send you messages to sell something. Sending millions of e-mail is cheaper than sending leaflets by snail mail, but still costs money. If I don&rsquo;t buy anything, they will have the costs but no profit. If we all just stop buying, Spam will stop automatically!!!!</p>

			 <p>The holidays are definitely over; I have spent my first day at the office again. Of course my colleagues wanted to know everything about my trip and of course I recommended them to visit Croatia as well.</p>
<p>Black polo shirts with the company logo arrived during my absence, and everybody except me was wearing those shirts in the office. Wearing the polo is more or less obliged, unless you have a reason to dress more formally. I don&rsquo;t mind wearing this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uniform<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since it is a nice shirt and saves me from making some wrong choices in that very difficult first hour of the day.</p>
<p>As expected, the work I left on my desk before leaving was still there, so today I continued working on the English version of the corporate site. I still need to translate some documents and have to create some screenshots of the software, but I hope to finish it this week.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The site is already live<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but gives 404 errors for the pages that I still have to translate. In my opinion a bad decision, but since my move to the international department I have no influence on the design and technical side of the site anymore. The only way to get rid of these 404&rsquo;s is to work hard this week!!!</p>

			 <p>Short, but absolutely worthwhile‚Ä¶</p>
<p>That is how I would describe our short holiday to Croatia. We absolutely have the feeling that we should have stayed longer, since the country is sooooo beautiful.</p>
<p>We have seen a lot of nice things, but we missed visiting Split, Dubrovnik, Zagreb and Plitvice national park.</p>
<p>We did visit Rovinj, Pula, Zadar and the Paklenica national park. I could write a lot more about it, but I don&rsquo;t have the time for it.</p>

			 <p>The car has been thoroughly checked, my colleague has been informed of ongoing issues at my job,‚Ä¶ I guess I am almost ready for holidays. There are only three things left to arrange before I will disappear for two weeks.</p>
<p>First at home. Tomorrow I will clean our house and do some shoppings (we only have yoghurt and beer in the fridge!). I also have to ask our neighbours to take care about our plants; they are very thirsty with this weather.</p>
<p>Then I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I need to finish the on-line edition of the Link magazine June edition. Besides that I need to activate a page I already created on which you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read live news from the World Camp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a Fimcap activity for youth animators in the Philippines. During the world camp, participants will write their stories on this page. Photos will be added later by the webmasters (of which I am one), since editing pictures, uploading them and creating the right HTML code is too difficult.¬†I could have used some advanced blogging tool, but decided that for the moment NewsPro will do the job.</p>
<p>And finally I have to prepare the trip. We decided to go by car to Croatia, with a stop in Milano to visit Roberto. And that is about all we decided and have prepared so far. We don&rsquo;t know which road to take, what we can visit and where to stay in Croatia. I hope that MJ was able to buy a copy of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lonely Planet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> guide, because then I will have good faith in our trip.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am almost ready. The next two weeks it will be very quiet on this web site!</p>

			 <p>The good thing of buying a cellphone pack is that everything comes pre-configured. I have chosen the Movistar Activa pack with a Sony Ericsson T200 phone.</p>
<p>One small box containing the phone, a power adaptor, a manual for the phone, the Movistar Activa SIM card and the accompanying manual. In the shop they placed the SIM card in the phone, activated it and selected the right rate. I could use it immediately, everything was configured.</p>
<p>Everything? Well, no. I couldn&rsquo;t use WAP. Not that I really need WAP, but I prefer that everything works when I buy something. I intent to use WAP for only two tasks: check my bank balance if I want to purchase something expensive and to do some emergency browsing in case <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.fimcap.org">www.fimcap.org</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is having problems.</p>
<p>Both manuals I received are user-level manuals (how do I send a SMS message) and hardly contain any technical details. So I changed the language from Spanish to English (somehow technical terms are easier to understand in English) and started browsing through the settings.</p>
<p>After trying out some options I found it: the phone was configured to use WAP over GPRS, while the prepaid Movistar Activa I use does not support GPRS by default.</p>
<p>This is really stupid, they deliver a phone and a SIM card bundled with WAP settings that don&rsquo;t function in this configuration!!!! It would be more logical to configure the phone by default to use WAP over GSM, and let the few people who do contract for GPRS configure their phones later!!!</p>

			 <p>Relax, relax, relax‚Ä¶¬†I really needed to relax, and that is exactly what I have done.</p>
<p>Friday after work we met with some friends at the Tapas Gallery. First I had to convince them to sit outside in the comfortable terras, while they preferred the air conditioning inside. Even though we were eating some Patatas Bravas, Maria Jos√© and I were still hungry, so we headed to Telepizza for a pizza. What a horrible dirty place is that!!!! Next time we will phone them from home or go to the Burger King.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On Saturday morning I was supposed to clean our house, but instead of that I walked into town to buy me a new cellphone. I already figured out that I wanted a Telefonica Movistar prepaid number, since I am not using the phone that much and mostly to phone Maria Jos√© who also has Movistar. For the phone I only knew that I wanted one of the major brands, except for Motorola. After looking at the options in the shop, I chose the Sony Ericsson T200, a beautiful small device.</p>
<p>At lunch time, the temperature had risen to 38‚Äì40¬∞C. With these temperatures, there are only two things you can do: stay at home (if you have air conditioning) or go to the swimming pool. We chose the last option as we don&rsquo;t have air conditioning. We headed to the amazing pool of Alpicat and bought a season ticket.</p>
<p>To my shock I received a reduction because of my age, I am definitely getting old!!!! For only ‚Ç¨15 I can swim the whole summer.</p>
<p>When around 7 o&rsquo;clock the temperature was a little bit more bearable, we took a shower and headed to Carrer Major for some shopping. Maria Jos√© was in a buying mood, and as usual that meant that she could not find anything while I easily bought some new clothes.</p>
<p>The Sunday started late. I went downstairs to Lo Panet to buy some croissants for breakfast and bought a newspaper, while Maria Jos√© made the coffee. After this slow start we cleaned the house and headed to Alpicat to help my in-laws preparing the lunch.</p>
<p>The rest of the day&hellip; swimming pool!!!</p>

			 <p>I always thought that the Internet would not be suited to learn a language, because it is better to learn from a real teacher who can explain things to you.</p>
<p>Once again Mark Pilgrim is two steps ahead of everybody. First, he started a Spanish site, to practice his Spanish a little bit (I know, I should also write in Spanish on this site), and I suspect also to have a good excuse to design a new site.</p>
<p>After announcing this new site, a second message for the Spanish speaking readers appeared, asking for Spanish curse words, dirty words and insults. I guess he just wants to built a filter for the comments on his new site.</p>
<p>Anyway, the amount of reactions and the contents of these reactions is impressive!

			 <p>The temperature is around 35¬∞C for over a week now, during the day you hear a lot of complains about the heat, in the evening people live on the cool streets.</p>
<p>Everybody runs to the beach in the weekend, Lleida is getting empty. And not only here, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Russell Beattie<!-- raw HTML omitted --> made the same observations in his entry <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Small Spanish Towns<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The holiday season is approaching, so we are thinking about what to do. We have two short periods to get away: the first two weeks of July and the first two weeks of September.</p>
<p>We were planning to visit the Netherlands in July together with my in-laws (they never went abroad), but we are not sure if they recovered enough from their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->car accident<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If not, we will try to go in September. The other short holiday we plan to take our car and drive to Croatia, with a short stop in Milano to visit our friends Roberto and Francesca.</p>
<p>Maybe we will also stop in Venetia. Besides travelling we also want to have some days to stay at home and relax, since lately we hardly have time to be at home.</p>
<p>Then there are also some people visiting us. The most important ones are my parents, who will be here on August 12‚Äì19. My mother has not seen our finished house yet; the last time she was here was in July 2002, when we just started the reconstruction of our house. My father has visited us two times more, mainly to work in our house.</p>
<p>The truth is that we haven&rsquo;t made a lot of progress since he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last visited us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Therefore we plan to finish some more small things, so my father doesn&rsquo;t get the impression that we don&rsquo;t do anything (keeping up appearances)‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Yesterday Roberto phoned us from Italy to tell that he and Francesca are going to spend some time in the beginning of August in Catalonia, and surely will visit us. Yes, we are definitely looking forward to the summer!</p>

			 <p>I love technology. I just love it. And I love computers, cellphones, PDA&rsquo;s, digital camera&rsquo;s and other geek toys. The only thing is‚Ä¶ I don&rsquo;t have them!!! I used to have some fine toys, but they have been stolen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some months ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I do have some computers, three in total. It is not the quality of them but the amount that make them geek toys. My desktop computer is the most advanced of the three, with a Cyrix P-133+ processor and 48Mb of memory. Yes, I know it is not that impressive. But after I reinstalled everything lately it runs faster that the mega computer I use at work. I did keep some room on the harddisk to install Linux to have even more pleasure. But‚Ä¶ no Linux at the moment!</p>
<p>You might think that I must be a sad geek without any toys, but that is certainly not the case. I don&rsquo;t have any toys, because I am looking around to decide what toys I am going to buy. Alright, I could go into a shop and buy the latest and the greates phone, PDA and computer, but that is gonna cost me an awful lot of money.</p>
<p>First of all I decided that I don&rsquo;t need a fancy cellphone. If I have time I will buy a prepaid number this weekend, and I will probably start using a second hand phone. For the moment that will be enough, since I don&rsquo;t phone a lot and neither plan to use any other functions.</p>
<p>I will also keep on using my old computer. It is fast enough, and with a little bit of extra memory, a wireless connection to the ADSL router and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linux<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installed I sure will have lots of pleasure of it.</p>
<p>That leaves me without PDA. Palm recently released a new model, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zire 71<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which kicks ass! It has a built-in camera, so it gives me two toys for the price of one. The only problem is the price, which is around ‚Ç¨300. I will have to think it over a few more times, but I am afraid that I am going to buy it‚Ä¶</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Lately a lot of talk has been going on around Microsoft&rsquo;s web browser Internet Explorer (IE). This is my contribution.</p>
<p>First I want to go back in history. The first graphical browser <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NCSA Mosaic 1.0<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was available in 1993 (I was one of its happy users). After a little bit of hesitation Microsoft jumped on the internet train with their Internet Explorer. Between that moment and the year 2000 Microsoft came with 6 versions of their IE browser.</p>
<p>At that moment they had a huge monopoly in the browser market because of their monopoly in the OS market, and they sat back and relaxed.</p>
<p>Now, three years later (30% of the time since the creation of the World Wide Web!!!), we are still stuck with the same version, and it looks like we will have to deal with it for two more years, since Microsoft announced that they will only deliver their browsers together with Windows, and the next version of Windows (Longhorn) is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scheduled for 2005<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I think they are making a mistake. It is true that they have the monopoly, but more and more people are switching to other browsers. Furthermore, technology is advancing.</p>
<p>More and more sites appear that make use of features that IE doesn&rsquo;t support, giving users a less than perfect browsing experience. At this moment the majority of the sites still uses code specially tweaked for IE, but little by little site designers start using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->standards compliant code<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And everybody knows that conforming to standards is not Microsofts strongest point. Their philosophy is ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->what the monopolist uses is the standard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô.</p>
<p>That is why IE6 does not fully support CSS2, a standard created two(!) years before they created IE6.</p>
<p>But this is not why they are loosing users. After all, users don&rsquo;t care about these things, the web designers have to make sure their pages are coded well. But IE6 is also behind on the user interface side.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has nice features as a pop-up killer, an image manager to block unwanted images and a site navigation toolbar which lets me navigate through this site using the arrow keys on my browser.</p>
<p>Everybody is free to choose their browser, but I prefer a more modern browser than IE, which misses one third of the development of the Internet. At home I have installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Firebird<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which has an install file of only 6 MB. Although is is still beta software, it runs perfectly on my old computer and gives me a lot more browsing pleasure than the browser installed by default.</p>

			 <p>It has been a while since I changed the backend of my site from NewsPro to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>A side effect of this change was that all pages changed URL, which I considered a minor problem since most people enter the site through the home page (which did not change).</p>
<p>Normally I try to keep URL&rsquo;s the same, but the old system used horrible filenames like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1025286960,58049,.html<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and stored all files in a single directory.</p>
<p>Like I said, most visitors enter the site through the front page, but there are some people looking for specific information with search engines. Until today these visitors were presented a ‚Äò404 Page not found‚Äô error page of my provider directly followed by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->homepage of my provider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In other words, these visitors end up at a completely useless page, and won&rsquo;t ever visit my site anymore!!!!</p>
<p>Something had to change. First, I wanted to change the error message from 404 (Not Found) to 410 (Gone), since the latter message is more precise. All visitors looking for never-existing files will still get the old 404 message. I read about this code a while ago on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dive into mark<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I kept it in mind for using it on m own site.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to show them another page, which at least links to my site. For the moment I chose to present them the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->search page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so at least they can search my site for the information they are looking for.</p>
<p>I am planning to create a separate error page explaining what has happened in more detail, but until now I will just show the search page.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Apache server has the ability to specify configuration options in a file called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.htaccess<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The settings in this file are valid for the current and all underlying directories, and thus can be overruled by another file.</p>
<p>I created this file in the root directory of my site and added the following information:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ErrorDocument 410 /cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/cgi-bin/newspro
RewriteRule cgi-bin/newspro/(.*) - [G,L]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In &lsquo;normal&rsquo; language, these lines say the following:</p>
<p>The first line says that the page at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which is my search page) has to be shown in case a request has status ‚Äò410: Gone‚Äô.</p>
<p>The second and third lines activate and configure a module for the Apache webserver calles <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mod_rewrite<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which allows me to process the next two lines.</p>
<p>The fourth line defines the condition to me used for the rewrite. It says: if the requested URL starts with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/cgi-bin/newspro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The last line specifies what has to happen if the condition above is met: rewrite <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cgi-bin/newspro/<em>.</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --> with nothing (-). Besides the rewrite (which does nothing) two options have been specified: G and L. The first changes the status to Gone (410), and the L tells that this is the last rule to process.</p>
<p>In short: if the URL contains <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/cgi-bin/newspro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the status will be changed to Gone, and when error 410 (Gone) occurs, the search page will be shown.</p>

			 <p>With fancy e-mail I mean HTML mail.</p>
<p>Most mail applications are able to send (and receive) messages in two formats: text only or HTML, and most applications use HTML by default, which is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BAD THING<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>People like to use HTML e-mail, because it looks nicer with all those colors, fonts, pictures,‚Ä¶ and therefore most software companies like it.</p>
<p>But for writing a simple ‚ÄúHello, how is life in Lleida?‚Äù message you don&rsquo;t need bold words nor blue titles. Plain text is probably better readable than that piece of art some people create.</p>
<p>There are of course always cases in which HTML mail is better, but usually that has to do with Viagra marketing, and those messages are deleted immediately.</p>
<p>You might think that even if you don&rsquo;t use fancy effects, HTML mail could not harm anybody, could it? Wrong! There are a number of reasons why I (and many other people) consider HTML mail harmful:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In short: unless you have very good reasons to use HTML mail, I would ask you to send plain text messages. If the appearance of the message is so important, you&rsquo;re probably better off by sending it as a PDF attachment or publishing it on a web page; those media are suited better for this task.</p>

			 <p>The reason we went to Harmelen last weekend was of course the wedding of Berry and Manon. Besides that, we took the opportunity to rest a little bit after the last busy weeks.</p>
<p>As a result, we have spent most of our time (except for Friday) on the terras in the garden of the house of my parents.</p>
<p>But Friday was different, since that was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->big<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†day; the day we came for.</p>
<p>After getting up late, taking a North-European breakfast, and waking up under the shower we realised that most of the morning already has passed, so we started to run to get ready in time.</p>
<p>Thursday we had a lot of time to wrap our presents in paper and prepare our contribution to the book with personal notes from the guests, but as usual I waited with these things until the very last moment.</p>
<p>With a little bit of running we arrived exactly on time at the house of Manon&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>Together with the family of Berry and Manon and some of their best friends we drunk a cup of coffee with some cake. We talked a little bit with Ton and Mirjam, who had brought their two children, of which I haven&rsquo;t seen the youngest (Daphne) yet. As you can imagine there were lots of things to talk about. After a while Berry and Manon arrived from their photo tour, and they looked gorgeous! Of course they were really happy to see us, and we had a small opportunity to talk a little bit.</p>
<p>Because the weather was great, we were able to walk to the centre of Harmelen, were the old ‚Äòmonastery farm‚Äô (now a restaurant) provided a beautiful ambiance for the official ceremony.</p>
<p>There were barely enough chairs to fit all the people present, and the ceremony was not too oficial with regular jokes about Berry&rsquo;s talent for playing darts, friends through thick and thin, and of course the hassle with the ‚Äòstoofje‚Äô under Manon&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Since we were in such a romantic place, Berry and Manon had chosen to use some time for some pictures together with the family, witnesses and friends in different combinations.</p>
<p>After sending Loek to the supermarket to get us some water, we walked to the church.</p>
<p>The mass was also really nice, although a little bit long. I participated as a witness, but was surprised to see that my role was only that: witness the rituals. I did not have to sign any document! Maybe if I would have been on the oposite site, I could have had an additional function by trying to catch Berry when he accidentally almost fell from the altar.</p>
<p>Anyway, after hearing them say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and seeing them exchange rings for the second time, we were absolutely sure that they were married, so it was time to party.</p>
<p>Besides that we were very thirsty, and as a result we arrived first in ‚ÄòDe Putcop‚Äô, where the reception would take place. Since it was already late, we quickly sung the welcome song prepared by the family, cut the pie, congratulated the couple and sat down to (finally) have a drink.</p>
<p>While we were relaxing and talking at our table, more and more people entered. Both Berry and Manon are very active Harmelen, Berry in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jong<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nederland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SCH<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Pirates<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, de <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kwakbollen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and Manon in EHBO.</p>
<p>After filling our stomachs we were ready again for the final party, with even more people than appeared on the reception. I tried to speak at least some minutes with all my old friends, but one evening is by far too short for this. At least I (and Maria Jos√© as well) had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sunday before leaving home again we visited Berry and Manon at home. We watched (parts of) the video made and talked a lot about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> day‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Wednesday they will leave to Florida, where they will visit Disney World (they are huge fans of Disney) and have a cruise through the Caribbean.</p>
<p>I wish them a good time, and hope to see them soon again.</p>

			 <p>A while ago I wrote about my old <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Image gallery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and gave a link to the gallery since I didn&rsquo;t create the navigation tabs yet.</p>
<p>The gallery was created using a script called ‚ÄòImage Arcadia‚Äô which is not supported on a public site anymore. Although it worked alright, it still needed a lot of customisation to fit into the rest of the site.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Recently I run across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PhotoBlog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Quixotic Pixels. This is a set of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> templates, allowing me to manage my images the same way I manage my texts, without having to install extra scripts.</p>
<p>I uploaded some photo&rsquo;s from my old Photo Gallery and used the default blue style, and it looks alright.</p>
<p>The next time I will add all other photo&rsquo;s and I will adjust the look of the pages little by little until it fits with the rest of the site. There is still a lot to be done‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Two more days working and we will go for a short trip to Holland!!!</p>
<p>The reason is of course the wedding of Berry and Manon on Friday. We will leave Thursday early in the morning, giving us one day to travel, shop, talk with my parents and of course to prepare us (physically and mentally) for the big day.</p>
<p>Berry and Manon will get married ‚Äòfor the law‚Äô in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Restaurant de Kloosterhoeve<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I consider a good choice, since it has a lot more atmosphere than the town hall in Woerden and is situated in the centre of Harmelen.</p>
<p>The religious part of the day will take place in the St. Bavo church, and the party will be in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Restaurant De Putkop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to this day, firstly because it is an important day for some of my best friends and secondly because I will meet a lot of people to whom I haven&rsquo;t spoken for some time. And finally, I always like to go back to Harmelen.</p>

<p>Time to arrange our house and enjoy the weather. We urgently need a sun tan before leaving to Holland next Thursday. Can you imagine that we will be the whitest persons on the wedding of Berry and Manon? Nobody will believe we are living in the south of Europe.</p>
<p>Therefore we will be going to the beach tomorrow. Usually we go to Vilafortuny, which is a quiet place between Salou and Cambrils, about 70 km from Lleida. Surely we will leave early in the morning, as we expect whole Lleida to head to the water, and stay there until the early afternoon. The afternoon we will probably spent walking through the village, sitting on a terras or enjoying our life in another way.</p>

			 <p>The lesson of this weekend is: always study the program carefully.</p>
<p>Of course I looked at the program of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aplec del Caragol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I quickly came to the conclusion that we would only join the meals on Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon, and of course the parties on Saturday night.</p>
<p>We decided to skip the parade on Sunday morning, simply because we didn&rsquo;t want to wake up at 8 o&rsquo;clock after a ‚Äòheavy‚Äô night. If I would have read the program better, I would have known that I could just as well have joined the parade, since they were passing our house anyway.</p>
<p>The parade is a quite curious thing, and there is no way to continue sleeping when they pass your house. You have to imagine that the world famous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kwakbollen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Brass Band is passing your window 20 times in half an hour, with in between hundreds of people who continued partying the whole night without sleeping. Noise enough‚Ä¶</p>
<p>A funny habit is to throw water on the persons passing your window (ours was just too far from the street to do this), so all participants will be ‚Äòfresh‚Äô again for another day on the Aplec.</p>
<p>When we were cleaning the space of our colla after the Aplec, bad news arrived. The parents of Maria Jos√© had an accident with their car and had to go to the hospital for some research. While her brother and sister went to the hospital, Maria Jos√© and I went to their house to take care about the grandmother and the dog.</p>
<p>Last night Maria Jos√© slept in the hospital in the room of her parents, and I stayed in Alpicat. Both of them are reasonable OK, with a lot of browses and glass cuts in their faces. The mother of Maria Jos√© has a broken shoulder and will probably be operated this week.</p>

			 <p>Eating and drinking‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I guess that will be the central theme for today and the coming days.</p>
<p>This lunchtime I went to restaurant ‚ÄòLa Tapa‚Äô with 23 colleagues to say goodbye to a colleague. For me this was a great opportunity to see my other colleagues again, since I work only with a few people in the commercial department, and all the others are in another building. It also was nice to see the new faces and connect them to the voices I have heard over the telephone.</p>
<p>Tonight we are going to have a supper at the house of the parents of Maria Jos√©, to celebrate the birthday of her grandmother. We will be bringing some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coca de recapte<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and together with some tortilla&rsquo;s and a little bit of Cava (Catalan Champagne) my first culinary day will be complete.</p>
<p>But after that the party will begin. This weekend is the weekend of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aplec del Caragol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the snail party. The motto of the weekend says it all: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12.000 participants, 100 clubs, 200.000 visitors, 12 tons of snails<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>To get a better impression, change the word club in something like ‚Äògroup of friends with their family who has their own place to eat, drink, meet, listen to (live) music‚Ä¶‚Äô. There is no way to describe the Aplec, it is something you have to experience, and preferably in a colla (group). As any year, we will be with the whole family in the colla called ‚ÄòPicarol‚Äô.</p>

			 <p>I wrote the last entry on this site exactly four hours before the start of the ‚ÄòFesta Major‚Äô en Lleida. This morning I have been working again, so it is exactly four hours after festa major.</p>
<p>We had a great weekend! I think that we have seen all the highlights of the weekend, and in between we took the time to enjoy our free time. We have spent quite some time shopping for clothes. Maybe it was because our wardrobe looked empty after removing the winter clothes and clothes we never ware anymore.</p>
<p>Yesterday we went to a big factory outlet in a small town called Roca de Vall√®s. For those who don&rsquo;t know: in a factory outlet you can buy the clothes the factory does not want to sell in the normal shops because of small errors or because the model is outdated or experimental. You have to look carefully, but you can find good quality for a very sharp price.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the women&rsquo;s fashion is so horrible at the moment that we couldn&rsquo;t find anything for Maria Jos√©. And all we were looking for was a normal pair of jeans (unbleached), a white collar-shirt and a jeans jacket.</p>
<p>Later on that day, the deception of the morning was balanced by the wonderful show of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moros i Cristians<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. First we saw the parade through the city and in the evening they presented in a spectacular way how the Moros conquered Lleida from the Christians.</p>
<p>On Saturday we didn&rsquo;t see much of the party. We went shopping in town and relaxed at home. In the evening we had some friends for supper. After supper (which was around 1 o&rsquo;clock) we went to the ‚Äòregional houses‚Äô. Just outside Lleida on the fair grounds you could eat and drink specialities from different regions of Spain. It reminded me of the typical evening at Euroforums, where each country presents their typical culinary specialities. Only here tens of thousands people were trying to get the best. We usually hang around the bar of Galicia. The difficult thing is to find your friend in this huge audience.</p>
<p>Besides food and drinks there were also some concerts, of which I only remember that they were horrible. They told me that one of the artists has represented Spain on the Eurovision song contest‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The surprise of that evening was when I noticed someone who looked very familiar to me, only I couldn&rsquo;t remember why. He came to us and when he started talking I knew it.</p>
<p>Pietro had participated in a few Euroforums and is the nephew of the former Italian representative Marco. He told us that he is living in Barcelona since a few months, and he came to Lleida to party.</p>
<p>Yes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is like a small family‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Being a user of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movable type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a player of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BlogShares<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I have been looking to combine those things: it would be awesome to see Blogshares information on my site.</p>
<p>After looking around a little bit, I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MTBlogShares<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Raynes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. His plugin lets me publish all kinds of information from BlogShares on my site, but the one thing I have been looking for has not been implemented yet.</p>
<p>So David, if you read this, could you implement this in your plugin for me, since my programming knowledge is by far not as good as yours:</p>
<p>Using your plugin it is possible to obtain the URL of each stock&rsquo;s BlogShares page. The only thing that I want is a possibility to remove the string <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=">http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so that I have the URL of the site in question.</p>
<p>This allows me to create a list with links to sites I own shares of. As soon as the BlogShares spider visits my site and picks up those links, the total value of the blogs I have shares in will increase, making my shares worth more.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think about this idea? I think a lot of people will use your plugin if you have implemented this option.</p>

			 <p>As I continue defining the information shown on the main page, I find the list of archives by date way too long.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about how to solve this problem. The nicest way would be to group all dates by year and make a dynamical menu showing the months when clicking on the year. This would requiere some advanced JavaScript, and visitors without JavaScript would still see the whole list.</p>
<p>I went to look for other solutions, and came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brad Choate: Year Archives in MT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Brad describes a way of creating a page showing a year calendar. I guess I&rsquo;m going to implement this the coming days‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Whenever I am talking to somebody in Holland, one of the first questions asked to me is: ‚ÄúHow is the weather?‚Äù.</p>
<p>The truth is, the weather here is not so interesting as it is in Holland. Over there you never know what to expect, it my rain, it might be sunny, it might be cloudy‚Ä¶ everyday something else. Over here it usually is warmer than in Holland, and usually we have a sunny or partially cloudy day. Nothing special.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still interested in the situation here, please read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weather report on Internet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It appears that there are two amateur radio stations in Lleida publishing weather reports, so you will always be able to have updated data.</p>

			 <p>Q: How long does it take me to put my signature on a paper?
A: Over 5 hours!!!</p>
<p>To get my new passport, I had to fill in a lot of papers. I did all I could at home and send the whole bunch (request form, photo&rsquo;s, police report,‚Ä¶) to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->consulate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Last week they phoned me and told that they had sent the whole packet to Holland, but that I still had to come to Barcelona to put my signature on a paper. And this could not be done by post, but had to be done in person at their office.</p>
<p>So this morning I left home at 8 o&rsquo;clock to enjoy the traffic jams of Barcelona. After three hours I parked my car, I went into the office, put my signature and within 10 minutes I was standing on the street again. Two hours more in the car, and the morning was finished and I was home again.</p>
<p>Still I am very lucky, because since I live so far away from Barcelona, they are going to send my new passport to me by mail. People living in Barcelona are also ‚Äòobliged‚Äô to come and get their passport at the consulate, but for me they are willing to do this favour. The girl at the desk even told me that I don&rsquo;t have the pay the cost of sending it!!!!!</p>
<p>This must be my lucky day&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Now that I have a wonderful new CMS able to produce RSS <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feeds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I have been looking for a way to use it. My idea is to create a page showing the latest headlines from some news sources (see the list in the side bar), so that I don&rsquo;t have to visit each site.</p>
<p>I have found some applications (so called news aggregators) which do this, but until now I haven&rsquo;t found a good web service offering the same service.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to install an application, since I want to access this information both from home as from my work as well as when I am on holiday. My idea is that I don&rsquo;t have the same bookmarks on all those locations, and by offering a web page the information is always available.</p>

<p>Of course, four days at home is a little bit too much, so to start our short holiday we headed to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andorra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do some shoppings.

<p>Instead of buying shares for companies you virtually buy shares for weblog sites.</p>
<p>The value of a site depends on the incoming links. This very sites has no incoming links from other weblogs, so that leaves my website worthless. However, my outgoing sites are worth a little bit, so by linking to other sites, I add value to these sites.</p>
<p>The rest functions just like the normal stock market. Everybody starts with $500 and can buy virtual shares. At this moment my assets are worth $745, which I think isn&rsquo;t bad, but compared to some big players this amount is insignificant.</p>

<p>Waiting for Easter, when I will have some days off to relax a little bit. We have been thinking about going away for some days to the Basque Country, but finally we decided to stay at home and relax a little bit. Of course we will go to the beach one day, and for sure we are going to do some nice things the other days as well.</p>

<p>I know Karin since my first <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Euroforum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and have met her and her friends several times in different countries in Europe. Two years long I went to Switzerland in summer, to help them with their summer camp, and every time I crossed Switzerland I tried to make some time for a stop in Luzern. The last years however I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of contact with her, so it was a pleasure to see her again.</p>
<p>They arrived on Friday evening, while I was still at work, so they had to wait a little bit at home. They didn&rsquo;t mind after walking two days through Barcelona.</p>
<p>After my work we went for a beer in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->O&rsquo;Sullivans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after which we would meet Maria Jos√© and go to a restaurant.</p>
<p>However, when we wanted to leave the place, I noticed that my jacket was gone. I knew 100% sure that I had put it on the chair right behind us (and we were almost in the corner!), but it just wasn&rsquo;t there anymore. After searching around a little bit, we knew for sure that the jacket had been stolen.</p>
<p>I informed a waitress, who told me that the day before had happened the same thing. Without jacket (including cellphone, Palm III agenda, passport and drivers licence) we walked to the restaurant, where Maria Jos√© tried to phone to my phone. It was still ringing, but nobody answered (as expected).</p>
<p>We enjoyed a nice mail at Pastificio (pasta of course), brought our guests home for a beer and went to the police.</p>
<p>On Saturday I showed our guests around in Lleida. We visited the usual things like the Seu Vella, Carrer Major, Seu Nova, &hellip; We also taught them wat a ‚Äòsiesta‚Äô is.</p>
<p>On Sunday, after enjoying our breakfast, we prepared some sandwiches and drove to Ulldemolins. There, we took a drink and started walking into the mountains.</p>
<p>After almost two hours we were up on the mountain, almost 500 meters higher than where we started. We ate our sandwiches, and said goodbye to our guests. They were going to walk some hours more until they arrive in Montsant on the other side of the mountain, where they would have to find a place to stay. We walked back to our car and drive back home. Notice that this is not the normal way we leave our guests!!!</p>

			 <p>The Catalan government broadcasts a commercial on television urging immigrants to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->learn Catalan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you live in a country, you have to learn the language of that country, isn&rsquo;t it? I completely agree with this point of view, but then why don&rsquo;t I speak Catalan myself????</p>
<p>When I decided to move to Catalunya, of course I decided to learn the local language.</p>
<p>Over here, there are two languages spoken: Spanish, which is the official language, and Catalan, which the people living here all speak in daily life.</p>
<p>I decided to opt for Spanish for a number of reasons. First of all, Catalunya is not so big, and Lleida is close to the border of Catalunya; if I drive 25 kilometres I am in a Spanish speaking area. Furthermore, Spanish is a language spoken all over the world, at least more than Catalan, and all people here speak Spanish besides Catalan.</p>
<p>The only drawback of my decision is that I have to learn to understand Catalan anyway, since this is what all people speak over here, but that has happened just by listening to the people and living with them.</p>
<p>So after almost one and a half year living here I speak Spanish really well, don&rsquo;t I? Well, not‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The fact is that I hardly have studied since I lived here. I wanted to follow a language course, but all courses I could find started at hours on which I usually still am working.</p>
<p>So I depend on self-study. I have some books and CD&rsquo;s, and with a little bit of self-discipline it should work. Right!¬†So the problem is my famous (lack of) self discipline.</p>
<p>Seeing the advertisement of the Catalan Government made me realise my miserable level of Spanish. I think I am going to look around for a Spanish course again, because this has to change!</p>

<p>But, things are going to change (at least a little but).

<p>Completely in line to the amount of work spent designing the site (30 minutes), this change was also a quick and dirty job.

<p>For those people thinking that it would be a good think if Jeroen would for once spend a little bit more time to create a decent site: you are absolutely right, this site sucks big time.

			 <p>Today I was going to write about the wonderful weather we have here in Lleida.</p>
<p>But something happened this morning that took away this desire to write about the weather.</p>
<p>When I went to work, I noticed that our car wasn&rsquo;t closed. I must have forgotten to close it yesterday. I thought to myself that I have been really stupid, and went inside.</p>
<p>On the chair next to me was a package of paper handkerchiefs, of which I didn&rsquo;t remember it being there yesterday evening. This made me a little bit nervous. I looked around, and indeed somebody had searched our car; the papers in the gloves compartment were in a slightly different place than usual.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find anything else, so I started the engine and put the radio to go to work. The weather was beautiful and sunny‚Äî dammit! They took my sunglasses!!!!!</p>

			 <p>Because I am working on Fridays until 20:00 hours, it is not possible for me to fly to Holland on Friday evening. So this Saturday we woke up at 4:30 to be able to catch the first plane to Holland, which is not funny if you have a birthday supper the evening before.</p>
<p>We arrived in Harmelen at the beginning of the afternoon, and watched how my father and the neighbours were busy with the enlargement of their houses. The last weeks they haven&rsquo;t been able to work a lot, due to the freezing cold in Holland (there are some things that I definitely don&rsquo;t miss‚Ä¶). Work is making steady progress, and in a few months my parents will have 2 meters more living room (which they need urgently now that Sven is visiting them once in a while).</p>
<p>After this we went with my mother to the center of Harmelen city, to see the carnival wagons. After being a participant for many years and missing the carnival last year, it was a pleasure to see it from the side. Of course half of the village was on the streets (with the other half standing on one of the 20+ wagons), and I met a lot of old friends.</p>
<p>After seeing all, we went for a quick shopping round, to buy the things we miss most (cheese, peppermint, brylcream,&hellip;), quickly brought everything home and went to the carnival party to have a chat with my friends.</p>
<p>That evening Esther, Terry and Sven came for supper. Sven has changed a lot since I last saw him two months ago. He has grown a lot, is smiling and even trying to talk. It was great to see him again.</p>
<p>At night it was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->carnival time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> again. I dug up the old box with clothes and took out the pharaoh suit. Maria Jos√© chose my old clown suit; since it was already too big for me, it looked great on her. You can find a photo of us on my image gallery.</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock the music stopped and I heard Berry&rsquo;s voice through the microphone. This is what I already feared! I had to come to the front, and Berry explained in public that I came from Spain to celebrate carnival and my birthday in Harmelen. He gave me the present on behalf of the ‚Äòbrothers‚Äô: some Belgian beers, ‚Äòdropjes‚Äô and nuts (glad we didn&rsquo;t buy those that afternoon).</p>
<p>After waking up on Sunday and receiving the congratulations of my parents, we still had some time left, so we went to Montfoort to see the carnival over there‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>After all the troubles described below, I decided to try to install freeBSD.</p>
<p>Since my laptop does not have a CD player I tried to install it over a serial cable connected to my other laptop, which does have a CD player. The laptop with the CD player runs Windows 98, which does not support this kind of connections. Therefore I booted it from my muLinux floppy and entered the basic configuration details. Funny how an operating system on a simple floppy disk can accomplish many things I cannot do with a 100+ Mb Windows installation.</p>
<p>Before this I already prepared two freeBSD boot disks to start up the setup procedure. I booted my laptop from the first disk, inserted the second disk when prompted, hit enter to start the setup program, and‚Ä¶ reboot!</p>
<p>Time to read the manual (I know, I should have done that part before). Tried the same thing again, this time with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->boot -h<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option, but with the same result. Mmmm‚Ä¶ Maybe my floppies are corrupt, since I do remember having some troubles creating them. So I enter them in the other laptop, and they function perfectly‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll have to do some more reading. One of the things I am thinking of is that my old laptop does not have a lot of memory, so maybe it is not able to contain the whole setup program.</p>

			 <p>In December last year, I described on this site how I installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MuLinux<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my IPC Porta-PC laptop. I installed the WKS, SRV and X11 add-ons, so I had a working graphical user interface and the necessary e-mail (mutt) and web (lynx) applications. The only thing missing was the internet connection, and I wanted to configure my PCMCIA modem for this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was the moment that things started going wrong, I was not able to activate PCMCIA. As everybody knows, the power of Linux is that it is open source, so you can fix everything yourself.However, I am not a kernel hacker, so this option is unusable for me.</p>
<p>Instead I put all the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->error messages in an e-mail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and send it to the muLinux mailing list. Within an hour I had some responses, one of them being from Michele Andreoli, the creator of muLinux (try this with Windows!). They gave me some more options to try, but the conclusion was that in creating a tiny linux distribution, Michele had to cut out PCMCIA modem support (ethernet cards are supported however). Game over‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I do have a ‚Äònormal‚Äô serial modem which I could use to connect to the internet, but I want to use this modem as well for my desktop system. So the options are: using a serial modem or install another operating system which does support my PCMCIA modem.</p>

			 <p>The last years I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of sports.</p>
<p>When I was younger (yes, I&rsquo;m becoming an old man) I used to cycle every day to school (11 kilometres) and I have been playing table tennis and volleyball.</p>
<p>After I finished school, the only sports I did was the weekly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->paaltjesvoetbal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jong Nederland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But now that I&rsquo;m living in Lleida, I even stopped doing that, but it is time for a change‚Ä¶</p>
<p>As the title of this message already suggests, basketball became the sport of choice. It is one of the most popular sports here in Lleida, and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->local club<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is quite successful. I am not playing in that club, but only incidentally on Sundays together with some friends. We play on the square of the school oposite of our house, which I call our virtual garden (we only have a balcony).</p>
<p>Last Sunday was the first time I joined the basketball group. The weather was great, it felt like spring. And my muscles still tell me that I was playing too fanatically.</p>
<p>Next weekend I probably cannot play (good start, isn&rsquo;t it?), because Maria Jos√© and I plan to go to the pyrenees for some snow fun.</p>

			 <p>The site you are reading now is my 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> personal web site. You might think that it is not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> great, but you have to keep in mind that I created it in less than an hour. When I was making it, I was busy with my move to Lleida, and didn&rsquo;t have a lot of time to hack code.

In my mind I am already designing V4, but it might take half a year more before you will be able to see it (first I have to finish our working room, so I can put a decent computer to work with).</p>
<p>One of the things I want to implement in V4 is a history of my sites, in other words, I will copy V3 as it is now (with only removing some interactive options), add V2 (I still have it on disk) and recreate V1 from my memories. The nice thing of the four sites together is that they show the development of personal web sites through the years:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Besides my personal sites, I have been working on three more sites. After V2 was up and running, I created (also with FrontPage) Youth Games, a collection of games in Dutch and English. The site was a big success, but I didn&rsquo;t have the time to maintain it. Another FrontPage site was the DDC (Dooie Donders Club) site. In fact is was the same site as V2, but with another theme. I hope that after I have created V4 I will have time to make another DDC site, but for this I need some help from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->brothers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The site I currently spent the most time on is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I&rsquo;m sure you all have visited this site already&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update 2003.06.11<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: In the mean time I have updated this site and imported all news items. Although in this message was written that you are looking at V3, in fact I would consider this V3.5 or even V4.</p>

			 <p>After five days of hard work, my father has gone home again.</p>
<p>The result of all this hard work? Four painted doors!!! I know, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it was a lot of work, but trust me, he did a lot! I have been wrestling with those doors myself before, and I can tell you that it takes a lot of time. The biggest problem is removing the old paint. The doors have been painted at least three times before, with three different types of paint. The oldest layer turns into some sticky mess as soon as you try to remove it, and turns into stone on your tools. Besides that, the fine structure carved into the doors don&rsquo;t make it easier to clean them‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Because of the hard work, my father did not have a lot of time for social contacts, which is a big crime in this country! Therefor all social activities were propped into Saturday.</p>
<p>In the morning we had breakfast in the house of a friend of the parents on Maria Jos√©. Since this was a special occasion, they&rsquo;d fired up the grill to prepare a big pile of meat (and that for breakfast!!!!)</p>
<p>After the breakfast we took a short walk through the yards and went home to prepare ourselves for lunch. After being home for only one our, we went to the house of the parent of Maria Jos√©, te eat soup, french fries and‚Ä¶ a chicken!! I wasn&rsquo;t really hungry when I went for lunch (understatement), but after lunch I felt just as stuffed as the chicken I had been eating. I was happy to sleep a little after lunch (my father of course continued working), knowing that in the evening we would go to a nice restaurant to eat some more‚Ä¶</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I spend quite some time behind the computer, at work as well as at home. Mostly I use the computer for only four things: read my e-mail, read some web pages, create web pages and write documents. Over years I have tried to make my life as easy as possible, and I would like to share here with you how I am doing. Although I use both Windows (98 &amp; XP) as Linux, I will focus here on Windows.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Did you know that there are two protocols to read your e-mail? We have POP3 and IMAP.</p>
<p>Most people use POP3, but IMAP is far better. Why? First of all, because IMAP leaves messages on the server, so you can see all your e-mail from any location (I know, web-based mail can also do this, but has a lot of other inconveniences).¬†You can also create folders on the server.</p>
<p>At home I am still using a 28k8 modem to connect to the internet. If I want to read an important mail, but somebody has sent me a big file just before it, I&rsquo;ll have to wait for the big mail to enter first. Not with IMAP!!</p>
<p>With IMAP, first the headers of the messages are downloaded, and then I can decide which message I want to download to my computer. So I can skip the big message and read the important message first.</p>
<p>Like most people I am using Outlook Express for my e-mail. I know that I can install a better mail program, but why should I if OE comes preinstalled?</p>
<p>There are however some things that I really don&rsquo;t like about OE, but fortunately they are easily fixed.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is quoting. When replying to a message, Outlook puts the cursor and my signature above the original message. If after a while I want to read the entire thread of the message, I&rsquo;ll have to scroll down to the first message, read it, go up to the next message, read it, go up‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyway, it would be a lot easier if everybody would write their messages <!-- raw HTML omitted -->under<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the original message (and trim the message!!!!). I am using a very simple program that fixes this problem automagically: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OE-QuoteFix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. By the way, when reading a threaded message, it uses colour coding to show the different replies. Really handy!!!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lets continue with Internet Explorer. I use it not because it is the best, but because I can&rsquo;t deinstall it and don&rsquo;t have disk space for a better browser (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).¬†As somebody who designs web pages I can tell you how horrible IE is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Even though it is a bad browser, it has some features that are unknown to many people.</p>
<p>For example, I really hate pop-up screens (I know, this site has them, but read on‚Ä¶). To disable them, I changed the security settings of IE so that JavaScript will be disabled (tools ‚Üí internet options ‚Üí security ‚Üí internet ‚Üí high). JavaScript is used by many web sites, but mostly for features that I am not interested in (pop-up screens, tracking of my behaviour, fancy menus, etc‚Ä¶). If I notice that a site really requires JavaScript, I simply add the site to my trusted sites. But until now that was only necessary for four sites.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I know that not many of you create web pages, so I&rsquo;ll keep it short.</p>
<p>The greatest tool I have found is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HTML-Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is free and can do a lot more than its name says (HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, XSL, JavaScript, VBScript, ASP, PHP, JSP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB, C/C++, C#, Delphi / Pascal, Lisp, SQL, and more). But if I need to quickly change something, I usually use Notepad (see below).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One tip: You don&rsquo;t need Microsoft Word for everything!!!</p>
<p>Why not? Because the application is way too big (I only use 5% of the options), because Word files are way too big (ever received a Word document under 200k?) and more important: Word documents can only be read by Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>In other words, if I send somebody a Word document I force him to use a really expensive text editor!!</p>
<p>Most texts I simply write in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notepad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since most texts are short and don&rsquo;t need any make-up. If I want my headers to appear in another font, I&rsquo;ll switch to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Easy enough, isn&rsquo;t it??</p>

			 <p>Today at lunchtime we have removed all the Christmas decoration from our house; the holiday season is definitely over.</p>
<p>As this was our first winter in our own house, we have bought the decoration little by little, some things even in Holland. But after the Three Kings (if you want to know how we celebrated it, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read my story of last year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) it was time to remove everything.</p>
<p>The result of this first year is a big box with decorations. The only thing we have to do is find a place for our tree. It is quite big (way too big for our little balcony or our patio) and at this moment it is blocking the entrance of the house. We will try to find a home for it next Saturday, and hope that it will survive until next year.</p>
<p>At least our living room looks a lot bigger now‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>A new year has started, and it has started very well for me. This was the first time that we celebrated New Year in Lleida. We spend the last evening of the year with our family; eating, drinking, talking, watching television‚Ä¶</p>
<p>At midnight I participated in a typical (hilarious) custom: eat a grape on every bang of the clock, and thus ending up with twelve grapes in your mouth!!! Maria Jos√© was not able to finish her twelve grapes, because she was rolling on the floor laughing.</p>
<p>A little after midnight we went to visit a friend at home. She was supposed to go with us to the pub, but got ill that day (poor girl‚Ä¶). We had some more glases of cava, parked our car at home and went off to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pentagrama<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I always like to go to the ‚ÄòPenta‚Äô because they play a lot of music from the eighties.</p>
<p>The next day we woke up incredably early, at twelve o&rsquo;clock. We had a short breakfast and a quick shower and went off to the new year&rsquo;s lunch. In the afternoon we were painting in our house. Since we are living there we haven&rsquo;t worked a lot, so it still isn&rsquo;t finished yet. This extra free day gave us the opportunity to work a little bit.</p>

			 <p>A warning for all people who want to see our house: do it fast!!!! We are already destroying our new house:</p>
<p>Yesterday at lunchtime I decided to check our e-mail. So I took my laptop and walked to my working room. Just when I walked into the hallway, the laptop slipped out of my hands and dropped on the floor. Immediately I looked down to see whether my laptop was damaged, but I noticed something worse: the laptop had hit the floor with its edge and had damaged our brand-new floor!!</p>

			 <p>After the basic installation of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MuLinux<!-- raw HTML omitted --> earlier this week, I have been looking around and expanding the system during the last days.</p>
<p>The whole thing is mature and really well though out, with lots of user-friendly scripts and help files.</p>
<p>The core of the system is the setup script. This script is used to create configurations, and to configure modules. In the configuration is specified which modules are loaded and with what parameters. It is loaded during boot, so that all modules are loaded correctly.</p>
<p>To save a configuration as default simply type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->setup -s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. To load a configured module MOD use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->setup -r MOD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to force reconfiguration use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->setup -f MOD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Setup also can be used without parameters, to start the setup menu. This menu shows all available add-ons and modules and lets you configure them from one screen. Besides setup, there are a lot more scripts. Even well known UNIX command like grep are implemented as a script. I was really impressed!</p>
<p>After looking around and playing with all options, I decided that it was time to expand the possibilities of my system. So it took the WKS (workstation), SRV (server) and X11 (X window system) add-on floppies and installed them from the setup menu.</p>
<p>The WKS add-on gave me applications like mutt, ssh, pgp, tyhe SRV add-on gave me samba, smail, web-based system administration and PCMCIA support. X11 has the x-windows system with VGA-16, fvwm95, Afterstep and wm2.</p>
<p>At this moment I had an incredible amount of features, using only 4 diskettes. I played around a little bit again, and started configuring xf86 to have a graphical interface.</p>
<p>Usually this is the most difficult part to configure, since you need to know a lot of parameters from your system (OK, not in the modern Linux systems), but MuLinux was perfectly able to configure X using its probe feature. After 5 minutes I had a screen like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not bad, isn&rsquo;t is? For next week, I&rsquo;m planning to get Internet connection. First I want to put the PCMCIA modem from my Toshiba into the MuLinux machine (which is by then an IPC Porta-PC P5E-486/DSTN) and get it connected to Internet. Furthermore I want to try to connect it to another computer using a LapLink cable. And maybe, I&rsquo;ll download some more add-ons (GCC TCL TEX PERL EMU JVM NS1 NS2).</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t finished playing yet!</p>

			 <p>Yesterday morning I found the official invitation for the company christmas dinner on my desk, the dinner was going to take place the same day. Fortunately we already new about the dinner for one week‚Ä¶</p>
<p>After work, I first went to our office in Torrefarrera to receive the traditional christmas box, this year with a lot of alcohol and chocolate.</p>
<p>Then quickly home to change clothes. Since this was my first Christmas dinner, I didn&rsquo;t know the dress code. I knew that a suit would be overdone, but to be sure I decided to take a tie with me and decide whether to wear it or not at the restaurant when I see how my colleagues are dressed.</p>
<p>The dinner was really good, but I could expect that from this restaurant (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Petit Catal√°<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). One thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the distribution of the tables. They decided to keep all departments together, so I shared the table with the colleagues I work with every day, while I would have liked to talk more with the colleagues I don&rsquo;t see so often.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock we finished, but because we still had a lot to ‚Äòdiscuss‚Äô, we went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiling Jack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Today I can see my colleagues having troubles keeping their eyes open‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>One month ago we moved to our new house. Since then, things have settled down, but one thing still is missing: our working room still serves as a storage room, with my old computer packed into boxes.</p>
<p>Until that moment we both use my (even older) Toshiba Satellite Pro 400 CDT. This computer is not really fast, but in the mean time I have gotten used to it. It&rsquo;s really comfortable working on the sofa, but to connect to internet I have to move to the floor of the hallway. For the moment we have this solution, but sometimes one computer just isn&rsquo;t enough for two people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I dug up my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> old laptop, a 486 with 8 Mb memory and 525 Mb harddisk, but without CD player. I once installed Windows 98, but it wasn&rsquo;t running perfectly. Besides this, I don&rsquo;t have a licence for this machine, and don&rsquo;t want to buy one. Therefore I decided to install GNU/Linux on it.</p>
<p>Taken the absence of the CD-player and the minimal hardware, I started looking for a floppy-based distribution. I once used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HAL91<!-- raw HTML omitted --> distribution, but this only runs on a RAM disk, while I want to be able to install it onto my harddisk. Then I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MuLinux<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a tiny single floppy based distribution with the ability to copy the installation to the harddisk, and with some add-on floppies to install additional features like the X-Windows system, Wine, TeX, ‚Ä¶ It looked promising, so I set to work.</p>
<p>While the disk images were downloading to my Toshiba laptop, I started the other laptop from a DOS bootdisk to format the harddisk. It had quite some bad sectors, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a big problem. In the mean time the download was finished. I extracted the DOSTOOLS to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->C:\mulinux<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and copied the images (BOOT, WKS, SRV en X11) to the same directory. Next, I runned <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unpack.bat<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which opened the main archive <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mulinux-13r2.tgz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Then I fired up makefi.bat, which created an installation disk. Since muLinux distribution running from floppy, installation means preparing the floppies. After the installation disk was prepared, I rebooted my Toshiba, after which the installation process prepared the BOOT floppy.</p>
<p>I immediately took this floppy to my old laptop and booted it with it. It booted nicely and started the configuration procedure. The first thing I had to do was configure the swap space. The harddisk was DOS formatted, but I want to install my linux on a ext2 partition. Therefore I decided to boot the machine with only the necessary configuration, after which I should be able to use the linux fdisk utility to partition the harddisk. For the moment I configured the swap space as a file on the DOS partition and continued.</p>
<p>After configuring the swap space I had the option to load each of the available add-on disks. After selecting No for each of them, a configuration menu was presented with three options: No additional configuration, a minimal configuration or a custom configuration. I selected the minimal configuration, and Linux continued loading its applications onto the RAM disk.</p>
<p>At the end I was asked if I wanted to save these settings as default (which I did not since I want to change the partitioning) and then I was offered a tour which I also declined.</p>
<p>Finally I was presented with the prompt, indicating that I could start to work. This prompt is a silly thing, since the multi-user options are on the SRV add-on. Anyway, I enterer root (just for the show) and fired up fdisk. I quickly deleted the DOS partition and created an ext2 partition and a swap partition.</p>
<p>I rebooted the laptop, and went through the same procedure again, but this time I used my new partition as swap space and did some more configuration, like the keyboard layout.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my time to play with computers is finished for today, so I saved my configuration to the floppy (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->setup -s lock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and shut down the machine.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am going to copy the files from the RAM drive onto the harddisk and if I have enough time left, I am going to install the SRV and WKS add-ons. That will keep me busy for a while‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re now living in our new house for one week now, and things have settled down a bit.</p>
<p>The first days were a little bit chaotic. We found out that we didn&rsquo;t have hot water, so we had to improvise a bit with taking showers and washing the dishes. Our dishwasher still isn&rsquo;t working, because the hole in the closet where the tubes and the power cable of the dishwasher go through has been made in the wrong location. If things go alright they will fix this today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Last weekend I fixed the beds and the wardrobe in the second bedroom. When that was finished we could finally unpack a lot of the boxes in our office, which looks a lot cleaner now. We also could clean the entrance, which have been a storage place for some months and haven&rsquo;t been cleaned thoroughly during that time.</p>
<p>On Sunday we invited the parents and the grandmother of Maria Jos√© (the people who helped us so generously with this house) for lunch. A little bit of stress in the morning because we wanted everything to look perfect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> serve a good meal. And yes, we succeeded!</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t think I have to explain the current political situation in the Netherlands to you, since even here in Catalunya it has been on the news. The only comment I would like to make is that all of this is happening right after the first elections I didn&rsquo;t participate. A coincidence??? I don&rsquo;t think so‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to try to vote on the next occasion in January. I found out that I have to register in Den Haag, which I did today. Six months before the elections they are going to send me a form (I haven&rsquo;t received anything in June‚Ä¶) and after returning it, I will receive my voting card three weeks before the elections.</p>
<p>As usual, a lot of paperwork, but I&rsquo;m used to it. Let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>

			 <p>Last weekend we spend almost completely working in our house, from early in the morning until it was too dark to work (we haven&rsquo;t got light everywhere yet‚Ä¶). And I can honestly say that we&rsquo;re fed up with it!</p>
<p>I have spoken to people who told me that they like to work in their house to relax a little bit after working in the office, but I rather have a beer in a bar to relax.</p>
<p>This weekend I prepared the walls for painting; filling the holes, taping off the windows and the doors, etc. Maria Jos√© helped me and started painting our living room. Now all we have to do is put the paint on it. We hope to have time for it this week, but I think that we&rsquo;ll have to do it next weekend.</p>
<p>Besides working ourselves, other people also have to do their jobs. If everything goes well, this week they&rsquo;ll put the marmer and the electodomestics in our kitchen, connect the toilet and the shower, finish the electrical installation and maybe come to put the floor. But our experience until now taught us that things rarely happen on their planned schedule, so we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s going to happen this week.</p>
<p>At least we have five days to get some fresh energy for the work of next weekend‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Guess we&rsquo;re just plain busy at the moment&hellip; Anyway, it&rsquo;s about time that I give you all an update about life in Lleida.</p>
<p>Last weekend we had a good excuse not to work in our house: Marcel and Rebecca were in town and we spend the weekend with them sightseeing. We had a great time, but afterwards felt a little bit guilty about the time we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have worked in our house.</p>
<p>Speaking about our house, things are going well. We have new windows and out bathroom and kitchen are almost finished. In the mean time we&rsquo;re trying hard to paint the walls. In fact, we&rsquo;re only waiting for the moment that the new floor arrives, and we&rsquo;re ready to enter our house. This afternoon we&rsquo;ll hear the date for that, hopefully they&rsquo;ll be able to do it next week.</p>
<p>Friday my father flies over to help us with the work as we have a short holiday. On Wednesday October 30th we&rsquo;ll fly over to Holland to spend some days over there. After that, I&rsquo;ll stay some more days as a business trip.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for the moment‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>I guess some people are missing their weekly update about my life. Not that nothing happened in my life the last couple of weeks, but I just didn&rsquo;t feel like writing. For all people addicted to news about me, here is an update.</p>
<p>First of all our house. The planning was that the kitchen should have been placed two weeks ago. But unfortunately the worker hasn&rsquo;t finished the prepatory work (electricity, water, floor, ceiling,‚Ä¶) yet. We hope that he&rsquo;s going to finish it this week, so within a week or two we&rsquo;ll have our new kitchen (which will be the first room completely finished then). In the mean time, we have started painting the ceiling of our bedroom. All in all, it looks like things are finally getting better!</p>
<p>Secondly, my professional life. These weeks my colleague is on holiday, so this gives me some more responsabilities and work. I&rsquo;m now communicating with distributors and clients in Holland, Australia, Bolivia, Mexico, U.S.A., ‚Ä¶ Strangely enough I find that in a lot of places Dutch people are working, and as a result I&rsquo;m speaking Dutch half of the time.</p>
<p>Finaly my personal life. This weekend we had once again visitors from Holland: my sister and her boyfriend. For them it was the last change to visit us for a while, since after December they will have to take care about their little child (we don&rsquo;t know yet whether it is a boy or a girl, although we guess it will be a boy). We showed them the ruins which will become our house and of course we went to see some of Lleida&rsquo;s touristic highlights. In the evenings we explored some of the culinary habits over here. For them it was the first time to have supper at midnight, and I discovered that this Italian waiter could speak fluently Dutch. We were really happy with their visit. After visiting us, they spend two days in Barcelona. If everything went right, they are now home again.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will leave early in the morning and drive up to Nouan-le-fuzelier, where we will meet my parents on a camping. Tuesday we continue and hope to arrive in Harmelen at the end of the day.</p>

<p>We expect to stay there about 10‚Äì12 days. Most of the time we will be in the house of my parents in Harmelen, but we also plan to spend some days camping on one of the beautiful campgrounds of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NTKC<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Last weekend I had a few moments that I was realising what a great life I live. These moments were not really special, but just small things which I appreciated a lot.</p>
<p>The first moment was Saturday at lunch time. We had spend the morning searching for furniture and just decided to buy the furniture we have seen two weeks ago. Heading for this shop, we stopped for lunch. That morning we prepared our ‚Äòbammetjes‚Äô but instead we went to a restaurant at the beach. The food was great, the wine was great, the weather was great, we were on the beach, so we could take a bath after lunch and we had finally decided which furniture we want. Yes, at that moment we were very happy.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening my very happy moment was more simple. We were sitting on our terras drinking a beer, when I realised that I could spend hours like this.</p>

			 <p>La Seu Vella is the most important monument of Lleida. It is situated in the middle of the city, on top of a high rock, and as a result you can see it from far away. La Seu Vella consists of an old cathedral and an old fortress. Yesterday the cathedral served as the perfect housing for a baroque opera.</p>
<p>‚ÄòLos elementos‚Äô was written by Antoni Lliteres (I also never heard about him) in 1704. It describes the relation between the four elements fire, water, earth and air, together with dawn, harmony, the time and the dead. But in fact the opera is about the political situation of Spain at that moment, where Felip d&rsquo;Anjou (fire) and Carles de Habsbourg (water) were fighting for the Spanish throne. Fortunately, everybody received the whole explanation on beforehand so that it was easy to follow.</p>
<p>The old cathedral had a beautiful atmosphere, but for the acoustics it was way too big. Also the chairs were really uncomfortable, but what disturbed me the most was the fact that the musicians had to stop in the middle of the opera to adjust their instruments.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the quality of the artists was high, the costumes expressed the right atmosphere and the opera was entertaining. All this made it 5 quarters of listening and viewing pleasure.</p>

			 <p>Although 2 months ago we started working in our new office, the office has been inaugurated officially yesterday. The last week a lot of people have been working very hard to make everything spick &lsquo;n&rsquo; span. A new gate, small white stones around every plant in the garden, repair the basket ball net, finish the kitchen in our guesthouse. Inside we cleaned everything and I supplied the two vacant desks with brand new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HP e-pc<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s and Samsung TFT screens.¬†We also created a nice screensaver with the ICG logo.</p>
<p>Before the guests arrived, the mayor of Lleida was shown around in the office and the gardens. I was ‚Äòlucky‚Äô enough that he was waiting for our CEO next to my desk, so I could have a short talk with him.</p>
<p>Present were the representatives of the local government, the biggest clients from Lleida, some other relations and our distributors from Andaluc√≠a, Madrid, Portugal and Mexico.</p>
<p>The mayor revealed a memorial stone on the wall, the CEO and the mayor held their obligatory speech, and then we could enjoy the cava, tapas and live classical music in the gardens.</p>
<p>Some people already told me that the new office looks like the house off a mafia godfather. Well, yesterday with this set-up and all the people in suits with sunglasses walking around, I certainly could agree.</p>

			 <p>Once again I had problems with my e-mail account. It appeared that a lot of messages I have sent the last month(s) have not actually been sent! Or better: they never arrived.</p>
<p>When sending they were accepted by the SMTP-server, but there they have been deleted.
The problem is that I am using some forwarded e-mail addresses like <a href="mailto:mail@jeroensangers.com">mail@jeroensangers.com</a> and <a href="mailto:jeroen.sangers@fimcap.org">jeroen.sangers@fimcap.org</a>. Mail send to these addresses are being forwarded to another mailbox, to which I connect with my mail program.</p>
<p>So far no problem, but I also want to send e-mail using the above adresses. Therefore I change the ‚Äòfrom‚Äô field in my mail application. But now, a lot of providers don&rsquo;t allow this, to prevent spam. Usually, the SMTP server will reject your message, so your not able to send it. My latest provider however, accepted the messages, but didn&rsquo;t sent it further (yes, to /dev/null!).</p>
<p>At the moment I am looking for a new provider. Until that, I will not be able to send my messages using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jeroensangers.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fimcap.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Sant Joan is an important saint over here. At least important enough to have a free day on June 24th. Combine this with the general strike last Thursday, and the result is that half of the country moves for five days to the beach.</p>
<p>Instead of the beach, MJ and I decided to move with our tent to a camping in the pre-pyrenees, next to a lake near Tremp.</p>
<p>As a result, this weekend we have done absolutely NOTHING. Every day we wake up quite early due to the heat in our tent, we ate some magdalenas with a coffee for breakfast, we took a bath in the lake, read a little bit in the sun, took another bath, etc‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>The summer has yet to start, and the temperature has risen up to 37 degrees. I&rsquo;m so happy that last weekend the temperature was a lot more comfortable. Last weekend my parents visited me for the first time since I left Holland, and of course I wanted to show them around in Lleida.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time together. We showed them the city, the place I work, the house we&rsquo;re going to live in, the place we&rsquo;re living right now. They also got to meet the parents of MJ and despite of the language problems they got along really well.</p>

			 <p>The biggest pieces of old furniture are now removed from our future house, the kitchen and the bathroom have been chosen, the measures have been taken‚Ä¶</p>
<p>This week it&rsquo;s really going to start. First all windows will be replaced and when that&rsquo;s finished the workers start removing a wall, making a new ceiling and changing the position of some doors. From then on we can start building our own little house, and with a little bit of luck we can live there after summer. There&rsquo;s a lot to do, but we&rsquo;re looking forward to do it!</p>

			 <p>I have been working now for four days in the international departement, and so far everything goes really well.</p>
<p>The first two days, my colleague explained me all the ins and outs of FrontRetail, one of ICG&rsquo;s applications. And now I am working hard on the Dutch translation of this application.</p>
<p>Must be easy for me, not? Indeed, not! Translating is a lot more difficult than I expected. Partly because the structure of the two languages is different, partly because I started with a badly translated version, partly because some words have more meanings, but most of all because my lack of knowledge of accounting.</p>
<p>Furthermore things go great. The office is absolutely beautiful (I still have to try out the swimming pool in the garden), my colleagues are helping me a lot and I am helping them (being the only technician in the office). The small problems every new office have like the absence of a coffee machine and an airco that works as a freezer will be solved soon.</p>

			 <p>I have been working a little bit more than six months now for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ricomack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

I also have been able to transform myself from AIX/UNIX oriented into a generalist, since I have been working with Windows 2000, Windows XP, RedHat Linux, routers, networking, Point-Of-Sale systems, printers, the ICG software, ‚Ä¶ I have to say that I really like my work, although sometimes the work is not exactly what I like to do (like repairing 10 year old PC&rsquo;s). But anyway, I feel comfortable in this company.</p>
<p>But last Friday I got an offer I couldn&rsquo;t resist. ICG wants me to be in their international ‚Äòdepartment‚Äô. At this moment this department is operated by only one colleague, who is responsible for both the international sales and support. And that combination sometimes is a problem, because it is hard to support other clients being on an international sales visit. So now I am going to help in the support.</p>
<p>This morning I packed my new PC and went off to the new office. Let&rsquo;s see what we can do here‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>That&rsquo;s it, it is over now. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aplec del Caragol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has finished. The aplec is a big feast with &lsquo;eating snails&rsquo; as a central theme. But in fact it is a lot more. It is about eating, drinking, culture, meeting old friends, music, ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>On the applec groups of people (collas) spent one weekend together on the festival terrain. There are about 120 collas, with each 50‚Äì100 members. Members pay an amount of money, for which they can eat and drink during the whole weekend. Every colla has it&rsquo;s own space on the terrain, provided with a small bar, tables and chairs, BBQ&rsquo;s and usually also (live) music. Every member wears the shirt and the scarf of his colla.</p>
<p>Some numbers: besides the 12.000 members of the collas, another 200.000 people have visited the aplec. In all, 12 tons of snails have been consumed!!!</p>
<p>The family of MJ is a member of colla ‚ÄòPicarols‚Äô and I was lucky enough to be able to join their colla. Also to my luck, this colla wears white shirts with a blue print as opposed to others which wear white shirts with pink dots, purple shirts with green print‚Ä¶</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure to pass all the collas and watch how every colla has it&rsquo;s own way of passing the weekend. Another thing which I like a lot, is that it is an activity for everybody. Sometimes three generations of one family are present on one colla.</p>
<p>There is only one backdraw: I think that if your not within a colla, it might not be as much fun. But maybe the 200.000 visiters think different about it‚Ä¶ I enjoyed it a lot at least.</p>

			 <p>This week we are in the middle of two major parties in Lleida.</p>
<p>Last weekend we celebrated the ‚ÄòFesta Major‚Äô, because the patron of Lleida, St. Anastasi has it&rsquo;s day on May 11th. There were plenty of activities organised through the whole weekend. For MJ and I, the weekend was even more special, because we had some visitors from Holland to join us: Berry and Manon.</p>
<p>On Friday night we started calmly. After having supper in a restaurant we went to the Camps Elisis. There was a big festival terrain with some big bars outside, a luna park and a hall for concerts. OK, I have to admit that the concerts were not so good, but maybe that&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Boney M.</p>
<p>On Saturday we did some sightseeing (La Seu Vella) and saw the children in traditional clothes offer flowers to St. Anastasi. In the evening we went to see the ‚Äòcorrefoc‚Äô (difficult to explain, but it has to do with jumping and a lot of fireworks).</p>
<p>Sunday we saw the ‚ÄòMoros I Cristianos‚Äô. First the presentation in the streets of Lleida and later the show at La Seu Vella. Their clothes were really incredible.</p>
<p>The coming weekend there is another party, the ‚ÄòAplec de caragols‚Äô. If I have time I will write about is next week‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>One thing I noticed over here is that there is more paperwork. Maybe I only have this impression because I am an immigrant, but I think that in general people use more forms and official papers.</p>
<p>I am living in Catalunya for half a year now (yes, time flies) and today I received a notice that my request for a residence card is honoured. can you imagine: 6 months for reading a request, finding out that I&rsquo;m from the EU and approving it!!</p>
<p>The letter which told me all this was completely unreadable, because all the references to the different laws involved. Anyway, I am ready to collect my residence card.</p>
<p>All I have to do (if I understand it right) is take the blue form (type XXX, model XXX, approved by XXX and of course with four copies), go to the bank, pay 5,06 euros, take the signed blue form, the yellow form (type YYY, model YYY, approved by YYY, signed by my boss and of course with four copies), 3 foto&rsquo;s and the unreadable letter (number ZZZ, approved by ZZZ, and hey, without copies?) and bring it during working hours to their office.</p>
<p>Luckily MJ knows the procedure, and also knows that the address on the letter is not the right one. I love paperwork!!!!!!</p>
<p>Ah, and the best of all: after a procedure of 6 months I will receive a card that is valid for 4 months. In other words: I should have asked the next card in February!</p>

			 <p>Today is a special day. Not only because Barcelona is playing against Madrid, but also because today is Sant Jordi (you know, they guy who killed the dragon).</p>
<p>In Catalunya this day is celebrated by giving each other presents. The boys give a rose to the girls, and in return they receive a book. For me this looks like a good deal, since the average book costs four times the price of a rose.</p>
<p>So after work I went to town to buy a rose. This was not very difficult, since there were roses for sale on almost every corner and at every traffic light. Also books were available in plenty; Maria Jos√© bought a book of Alberto Vasquez for me.</p>
<p>On the news they showed the numbers of this day of books and roses (besides lot&rsquo;s of pictures of books and roses. Today the Catalan people bought 5,5 million roses (there are 6 million Catalans!) and 10% of the yearly volume of books was sold today!!!! Very impressive‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Sunday I wanted to write about the cal√ßots. But after the cal√ßots, I was too tired to write. And the days after I was luckily enough to have to work out of town, so I missed my 30 minutes of internet before lunch.</p>
<p>Anyway, three days ago was the day we had cal√ßots; after all, it is the season for cal√ßots.</p>
<p>The week before we (or better MJ) was arranging all the things and inviting our friends. The Saturday afternoon we spent cleaning the garage, so we could put there some big tables to eat on. When everybody arrived on Sunday, we first drunk a vermouth with some chips, mussels, olives, cheese‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Then the father of MJ arrived with the cal√ßots. Cal√ßot is family of the onion (I think it is leek / prei in Dutch), and over here prepared in a fire, so they are all black. You remove the black part, put the cal√ßot through some special sauce and eat it like the Dutch eat herring. Delicious!</p>
<p>After the cal√ßots we put some meat on the fire, and we finished with a big pie. To finish the activity good, MJ&rsquo;s sister Cristine and her boyfriend Pere told us that they had bought an apartment here in Alpicat.</p>

			 <p>Easter time is always a good period to have a short vacation. Usually the weather is getting better, and after the first busy months of the year, I really need a break.</p>
<p>This year was no exception, especially with the work we have for our new house. Therefore we decided to book a flight and rest. We didn&rsquo;t have to think long for our destination; we were looking for a beautiful country with nice weather and nice people. Yes, Holland!</p>
<p>With a little bit of phoning (only one call!) we found a nice hostel which fitted our needs perfectly: Hotel Sangers in Harmelen. It&rsquo;s really cheap and has big comfortable rooms which look just like somebody has been living there until not so long ago. A perfect place to relax some days.</p>
<p>On Friday night I explored the local night life. There is an amazingly big offer of activities in Harmelen. I decided to have a sportive evening, and went to watch the Crespon darts tournament, organised by Darts club <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pirates<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Saturday after we woke up (quite late of course) we went shopping. First to the supermarket to buy all thing we cannot buy in Lleida like dropjes (zacht zoet), tijgernootjes, sup-a-soup tomato and cheese. Then we went to Utrecht to look for things for our house. We found a couple from Spain doing the same thing, but unbelievable for us they decided to buy paper serviets!!! Like we don&rsquo;t have paper towels over here!!!!</p>
<p>What can Catalan tourists do on an average Easter day? Since the shops were closed, we decided to go for some sight seeing. Our target was the river ‚ÄòLek‚Äô and the city Culemborg.</p>
<p>After getting the so-called fresh nose, we headed to Haarzuilens for a typical Easter custom: palm pasen. I can assure that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Palm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> beer tasted really good! That evening we enjoyed another typical Dutch custom: gourmetten. And we were not the only ones leaving palm pasen for this wonderful experience. In short: gourmetten is a way to invite friends for dinner without actually having to cook! No wonder it&rsquo;s popular in Holland‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Of course we have bought a set for gourmet. After all, we want our Dutch visitors to feel at home when they come to Lleida.</p>

			 <p>It is almost easter, and easter is a wonderful time for chocolate lovers like me. I always eat a lot of these small chocolate easter eggs.

<p>But the biggest sculpture is the one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prats<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Prats is local patisseria and chocolate maker, who creates every year a life size statue of a famous Catalan person out of chocolate. This year, Pau Gasol has the honor. Pau Gasol?????

<p>Here in Spain, people celebrate their saint as a second birthday, with a nice meal and presents from their family and friends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people name their children after the saint of the day the baby was born, thus denying their child an extra wonderfull day with presents and attention!</p>
<p>One of this victims is MJ. Though her birthday was last Friday, it was close enough to her saint to celebrate it all together. Poor girl‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And even worse, her boyfriend didn&rsquo;t give her any present at all!</p>

<p>I planned to arrange some things and go shopping on Friday morning, but as usual it was impossible to get out of bed early enough. Somehow every visit to Holland feels like a holiday, and the first days of holidays I usually spent resting (=sleeping). Anyway, by the time we got up, we had to run through the shower, quickly grab a sandwich and hop into the car to arrive on time in the townhall. The ceremony was funny and entertaining and I know it&rsquo;s a clich√© but the bride looked pretty.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we had some minutes left for shopping (dropjes, tijgernootjes, ‚Ä¶). The rest of the time we spent reading on the sofa. First of all because the weather wasn&rsquo;t so good, but also because at home we haven&rsquo;t got a sofa.</p>
<p>The party at night was also really ‚Äògezellig‚Äô. I had a chance to have a chat with a lot of people, and was able to hear the latest gossip. I was so occupied with talking to all those people that sometimes I forgot that MJ doesn&rsquo;t understand any of it. (Sorry for that, next time I will take care of you a little bit more‚Ä¶).</p>
<p>On the same evening, Pere had arrived home, so Saturday we showed him Amsterdam and Utrecht. We found out that a Dutch guide is of no use at all in Amsterdam, because on the streets you&rsquo;ll find more Spanish tourists that citizens of Amsterdam and the people in the souvenir shops speak better Spanish that I do. We also found out why groups of British boys only visit the red light district when they are completely drunk: the girls look like truck drivers.</p>
<p>In the evening we went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stairway to heaven<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to drink some beers.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we went back home again. Even though we had one day more, time seemed to fly. Next time, with easter, we&rsquo;ll try to stay even longer!</p>

			 <p>First of all for all the people who have asked me the last weeks: Yes, they do celebrate carnival over here! Of course a little bit different than in Holland, but they definitely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> celebrate carnival.</p>
<p>This weekend Roberto, our Italian friend, was visiting us. He choose a nice weekend to do so, as stated above. He finished his exams on Friday, had a party at night and went directly over to Lleida. So when he arrived on Saturday afternoon, we first offered him a hot shower.</p>
<p>After arranging his stuff, we hurried back to the city center to see the carnival parade. I guess it was at that moment that Jong Nederland received the yearly prize of honour (and with yearly I mean that JN is receiving it every year) for their wagon. Here the parade starts when the sun sets, and I have to admit that the wagons look really good with al these lights. There were about 30 wagons, mostly crowded with children. Popular themes were indians, the north pole, and vikings.</p>
<p>After the tour (at was already 21:00 hours) we took Roberto to an Italian restaurant. I know that it is quite a guess to serve pasta to an Italian, but this restaurant is really good. Nine is a little bit early to eat, but on these kind of days you have to be early, or you&rsquo;ll end up waiting a long time outside the restaurant.</p>
<p>After the meal, we went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->River caf√©<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is close to the place where the party in the evening would take place. The main party started at eleven thirty, but at midnight the hall wasn&rsquo;t even half full. The band was playing really good, but Metallica and AC/DC are not the kind of music I expect on a carnival party. Around one thirty more people started entering the place, waiting eagerly for the main act: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dr. Calypso<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Dr. Calypso is Catalunya&rsquo;s most famous ska band, and guarantees a lot of pleasure.</p>
<p>The next day we didn&rsquo;t do a lot, as usual on Sundays. We helped Roberto pack his stuff, as he was moving on to the mountains of Vall d&rsquo;Aran for his first skiing experience.</p>

			 <p>One of the nicest features of having your own web site is playing ‚Äòdetective‚Äô.</p>
<p>Every day the web server produces a huge amount of data; every single page you request and every single picture on that page is recorded in the log files. I use these log files to see who visited me, when did I receive those visitors, what kind of computers do they use, which pages are the most popular, ‚Ä¶ But the most interesting is to know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they got onto my site. Especially the visitors which entered from a search engine are interesting, because they were looking for some information.</p>
<p>This week I noticed something strange in my logs: I received a lot of visitors who were looking for information about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Astor Piazolla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I started thinking, because until I wrote this article, there is absolutely no mention about Astor Piazolla on this site. I have to admit that I like Astor Piazolla and his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Tango<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a lot; I even have some of his work on CD.</p>
<p>Aaaah, that&rsquo;s it! On my former web site, I maintained a list of all CD&rsquo;s I own. That list must still be in de databases of those web sites. But visitors of my old web site are automatically forwarded to the new one.</p>
<p>That only leaves the question why suddenly people start searching for Astor Piazolla. All the Dutch readers already know the answer, but I had absolutely no idea. Until I talked with my parents. Of course they told me about the big event in Holland: the wedding of Willem-Alexander and Maxima. And my mother told me that she liked the moment when Maxima showed some tears when they played Argentine music. And this piece of music (Adios Nonino by Astor Piazolla) is now nr. 1 in the Dutch hit charts. So thanks to the royal wedding I received a lot of hits.</p>

			 <p>Oops, already a week without any notice! Yes, it&rsquo;s about time that I write something new on my site. So I decided to write about the princess. Not the one of this weekend, but the one which I really missed last weekend.</p>
<p>As you might remember I made a small trip to Holland last weekend (exactly 24 hours and 10 minutes). O Saturday evening we went to the reception of the prince, organised by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CV de Kwakbollen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And the most important question on that evening is not who will be the new Dagobert (if you know the solution to 1+1, you&rsquo;re always able to figure out who he is), but how his princess will look. And if you know that Dago doesn&rsquo;t have any girlfriend or wife, the first question is WHO he chose to be on his side.</p>
<p>The tension was really high when Dago finally appeared. Of course we faked our surprise to see him (I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never<!-- raw HTML omitted --> could have guessed it could be him‚Ä¶), but immediately everybody started looking around, searching for the princess.</p>
<p>But no‚Äì‚Ä¶ to our disappointment, this Dago has chosen to celebrate carnival alone.
Alaaf for prince Remi XXVI!</p>

			 <p>I just noticed that I haven&rsquo;t written for a while about my job. And since quite some of the visitors of this site are ex-colleagues from MultiSystems/Avalix/Aino, I think that it is appropriate to write some words about my job.</p>
<p>The company I work for consists of three companies: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ICG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a company which produces software for shops and small companies, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ricomack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a company which has a shop and delivers technical support, and finally CST consultants.</p>
<p>I work for Ricomack, in the department ‚Äòinternet‚Äô. This department consists of Xavi and me (and part-time Massimiliano). We handle all work which is related to internet activities and servers. Ricomack acts as a ISP for some companies, we host their web sites and their mail accounts. This is mainly the work of Xavi; he also designs the web sites (he started the one of Ricomack just today, so don&rsquo;t expect too much from this one).</p>
<p>My main concern is the installation of new servers for clients, all HP with Windows 2000. Besides that I also repair desktops and do a lot of other small jobs. Today Xavi and I decided to make our room more comfortable, so I ended up with a drilling machine to change the TL lights. As I said, I do a lot of different things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am not so involved with UNIX anymore. Our internet server runs Red Hat, but furthermore it is all Windows.</p>

<p>And of course, if you come all the way from Belgium, you have to see something of the country.</p>
<p>On Friday evening he was shown the wild nightlife of St. Feliu de Llobregat (A.K.A. the town of the single women). On Saturday morning there was a meeting of the exchanges workgroup of CCCCCE, so I took Wim to Barcelona to walk around and show him that I don&rsquo;t know Barcelona very well.</p>
<p>After that we went with 8 people to Andorra. Why? To swim! Andorra has a really nice swimming pool, of which I already have forgotten the name, and we have spend the evening taking baths. Alveiro had arranged a nice cabin to sleep, in a house full of people who came to ski. I wonder if they knew how wonderful the swimming pool is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Sunday morning we spent tax-free shopping, and then it was time to go home again.
And the training course? Well, I think that Wim will manage&hellip;</p>

<p>This car, a white Fiat Punto, is also property of the family, and for the moment MJ and I are going to use it. This gives some relieve, because it is not always easy to car-pool with three people having a different schedule and working at different places. Sometimes I was traveling (and waiting) for one hour, while it is only 7 kilometers from home to work.</p>
<p>This weekend we will have to clean the car, and we are going to put in some personal thingies. Of course the frog which I once received for my birthday from my three brothers will take it&rsquo;s usual place in the back of the car‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>I know that in Holland the big parties are over, but here there is one more event left: the Three Kings.</p>
<p>(By the way, for those who are interested: yes, I had a great X-mas with a lot of presents and I really enjoyed celebrating the new year in Holland. In fact, I liked it soo much that I didn&rsquo;t take the time to write about it.)</p>
<p>Back to the kings. Yesterday they arrived in Lleida (and at the very same time in a lot of other cities‚Ä¶) and of course we decided to have a look at them. The streets is the center were really crowded; all the children were anxious to see the guys who were going to give them lots of sweets and presents. Somehow I had to think about Paul Derks, but I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I expected to see three old guys on camels, but the reality was a little bit different. First the was the police creating room for the caravan to pass. Than came some clowns throwing confetti and cheering up all the people. Quite strange, because I cannot remember the presence of clowns in the original Bible story.</p>
<p>After that came the giants and the big-heads. These are traditional figures showing up on all the traditional events. They were accompanied by some traditional music.</p>
<p>After that, the whole festivity became to look a little bit like carnival: a lot of decorated wagons and walking groups passed, all throwing confetti or candy. I remember seeing the shepherds, the camels, the factory which processes all the requests of the children and a wonderful star. Finally the three kings arrived. Each king was preceeded by a wagon with children, and of course gad a beautiful wagon himself. The end of the parade was formed by some big trucks, carrying all the presents for the children. The whole events was good for more than 30 minutes viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>Today, we ate a special ‚Äúthree kings cake‚Äù as a desert. Inside the cake were a bean and a small figure of a king, and on top of the cake was a crown. The person who finds the bean has to pay the cake next year, and the person who finds the figure has to wear the crown. Luckily I found neither of them‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>In Holland the weather is always the subject of the day, mainly because it is never the same as the day before. Last week, the weather has been the main topic over here as well. Not because it is changing so often (I wish it would!), but mainly because it is so bad. For the people who still think that I am in a warm sunny country: you&rsquo;re wrong!!! It is f***ing cold over here!!!</p>
<p>It came by surprise. When I was in Holland it suddenly started snowing. And because that hasn&rsquo;t happened the last decades, they are not prepared for it. Therefore it took while before they got all the material from other provinces. As a result, I was forced to spent the night in Barcelona last Sunday, because the road between Barcelona and Lleida was still blocked and it was too late to take the train. Fortunately Carme and Marta were so kind to buy already a ticket for the morning train and to pick me up. Thanks a lot!!!!!!!</p>
<p>At this moment most of the big roads are cleared, but the world is still very white. And to be honest: I am getting quite fed up with this weather. After all, one of the reasons I came here is the sun.</p>

			 <p>At this moment it is already a week ago since I was in Holland. Yes, I have been a litlle bit busy this week (indeed, I slept a lot).</p>
<p>Anyway, I can say that I really enjoyed my short visit. The wedding of Paula and John on Thursday was really great. But OK, free beer is always great, isn&rsquo;t it? It was great to see everybody again. And in such an atmosphere, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that the band made all the songs sound like Ren√© Froger.</p>
<p>Friday was another highlight, the concert of De Heideroosjes. It was a pleasant surprise that we went with 27 persons. At the busstop I found out that I was by far the oldest: The second (Jos) is 6 years younger!!! At least it shows that I am still young of heart. The body however was having some more problems. I had to go to the side a few times to get some fresh air. The concert was as I am used to.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday I have spend with my family (indeed, sleeping again). My room at home has really been transformed by my parents. They bought a new bed for me and removed the old computer desk. A think they want to tell me this way that MJ and I are always welcome.</p>

			 <p>After hearing a lot of times that having fog every day is not normal, and that it is only the case here in Lleida, I decided to check it out myself.</p>
<p>So last Saturday, MJ and I decided to spend one day on the beach, hoping to see some sun. We woke up early (at least for us), prepared all the stuff for a pick-nick on the beach and got into the car.</p>
<p>Although it was not as sunny as we hoped, the weather was good enough for a pick-nick. We found a nice spot on the beach to sit down and eat our sandwiches and our salad and drink some red wine. In the mean time we could enjoy the view of the sea in front of us. We were just in between Salou and Cambrils. After the pick-nick we walked to Cambrils to get a cup of coffee. Cambrils is a pictoresque little town with a lot of nice shops and restaurants. Unlike Salou, it hasn&rsquo;t got bars and discos, and as a result the atmosphere is much different.</p>

			 <p>The 6<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of December is an important day: it is the birthday of &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sinterklaas<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (yes, I know it is Paul). Every year the old man leaves Spain to visit Holland for a few weeks and to give presents to all the Dutch children. As you can imagine, the Dutch children are very pleased with his visit.</p>
<p>But I have to warn all the Dutch parents: DO NOT TRUST THIS GUY!!!!!!! I haven&rsquo;t found out yet what is wrong with him, but it is a fact that the Spanish people are really happy because he is out of the country for some time. The party here is even bigger than in Holland: here everybody receives an official free day, only because Sinterklaas is out of the country. You can imagine how much they hate him‚Ä¶</p>
<p>To celebrate our free day (d√≠a del constituci√≥n), I went out with my colleagues yesterday. It is very common to visit a restaurant with your colleagues in December. Before that I visited a pub with two others. I hoped to get to know another pub, but they decided to visit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scrub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. OK, it is a nice pub, so I was not complaining.</p>
<p>The supper was really good, although the others were complaining a little bit about the price. Here 4000 pesetas (Fl. 53,-) is a lot of money for a meal, but for me it is a quite normal price. Afterwards we visited some pubs. And yes, the very first one (O&rsquo;Sullivans) was the one where my sweet darling MJ and here friends happened to be‚Ä¶ At 4 o&rsquo;clock I met here again in River Caf√©.

			 <p>This weekend MJ is in Lithuania for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fimcap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> meeting. I better say ‚Äòwas‚Äô, because she is almost back again. In a few hours I will take the car and pick her up in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Of course I could have used this weekend to have a big party (after all, the b**** is gone‚Ä¶), but I decided to have a quiet weekend. Of course I went to drink a beer yesterday, but most of the time I was sleeping, reading, watching television or studying Spanish. Today we also celebrated the birthday of Cristine, MJ&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>The weather here is alright. During the day it is sunny, but in the morning and after five (I had to check at the window‚Ä¶) there is one problem: FOG! Not a little bit, but really a lot; sometimes you can see only ten meters. That is also one of the reasons why I have decided to leave really early to Barcelona. The other reason is that I expect a lot of traffic, because this weekend the winter sport season has started. There are some places where the entrance to the pistes was free this weekend (yes, in some ways the Catalans are like Dutch).</p>
<p>By the way: did you know that Catalonia has over 300 pistes? Me neither.</p>

			 <p>Today it is Saturday, the day of the cleaning the house. MJ and I always do the first floor.</p>
<p>Or better: MJ is doing the first floor, and I am bothering her a lot, thinking that I am helping her. Fortunately it is not a lot of work, so we only spent some time in the morning doing that.</p>
<p>This afternoon (after lunch, so around five o&rsquo;clock) we will go to town to do some shopping. I really like the opening times of the shops over here. In the Netherlands shops close at the moment that they open here. On the other hand, I feel sorry for the people working in the stores.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday somebody tried to phone me during the day. Unfortunately I was not home yet, so I thought that it might be handy to explain something about my working hours.</p>
<p>In the morning, usually I leave at eight o&rsquo;clock. First I go to Lleida to bring MJ and her sister Cristina to their work. Afterwards I drive to Torrefarera where my company is. I start working at nine o&rsquo;clock and finish again at half past one. Then I go to Lleida again, pick up the others and arrive home at half past two. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t have to go to Lleida; then I leave home at half past eight and arrive home again at quarter to two.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I enjoy a nice meal with the family (in Spain the lunch is the most important meal of the day), and I go back to work again at quarter past three (or twenty to four if I can go to my work directly). I work until 8 o&rsquo;clock, and usually am home again at half past eight.</p>
<p>Of course there are always exceptions. Sometimes after work we go the pub to drink something with some friends. Usually we go to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scrub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And other times I spent some time in town shopping or arranging some papers.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think it is long enough for today.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday MJ and I decided to visit the cinema. After a very busy week with a lot of new impressions, we felt that we had deserved it. Our choice was ‚ÄúThe Score‚Äù.</p>
<p>We found out that we were not the only ones who have had a busy week, because the city was full of trafic, looking for a place to park. Normally in the Netherlands the Sunday evenings are quiet, but here Sunday is the day to visit the cinema. After 10 minutes circling around the cinema, we were lucky; a place for our car only 2 minutes walking!</p>
<p>Fortunately we arrived early, because only 10 minutes after we arrived the entrance of the cinema was completely full with people. In their wisdom, the designers of the cinema had decided to place the entrace to the halls, the toilets and the ticket office all in the back of the entrance hall. As a result, it was almost impossible to arrive to the ticket office and to go to the toilet before the movie.</p>
<p>When the movie started, I came to a big surprise: Marlon Brando has learned to speak Spanish really good! And he also had an operation of his throat. He sounded so different‚Ä¶ And not only Marlon, but also all the other actors. By the way, I think that this also explains the average level of English spoken in this country: people never hear English in the cinema or on TV.</p>
<p>And yes, the movie was Ok.</p>

			 <p>Today was the great day‚Ä¶ working at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ICG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After a short tour through the building and meeting a lot of people of whom I can&rsquo;t remember the names anymore (as usual on a first day) I was introduced to Massimiliano. He told me everything about his job and about the company. After three hours of listening to Spanish, my head was at the point of exploding. No more information please!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Spanish working hours foresee in these situations. After a nice lunch at home I was ready to listen again. Besides listening I also installed Windows 2000 on some computers.</p>
<p>At the end I have a positive feeling about it, but I really have to get used to speaking Spanish the whole day, because now I still have to concentrate too much.</p>

<p>I spent yesterday evening at the &ldquo;Jeugdhof&rdquo; just like most Thursdays the last 13 years. Sure I will miss that. Just as usual, it was way too late when we finally went home, but this time I had a good excuse since it was the last time.</p>

<p>I can tell you that it wasn&rsquo;t easy to say good-bye to Aino after working 4 years and 7 months for MultiSystems/Avalix/Aino. Yesterday morning I finished the last work.

<p>Yesterday after a big fund-raising activity, the board and the animators of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jong Nederland Harmelen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†surprised me with an official good-bye. Normally leaving animators are thanked at a special evening with all the parents of our members, but since I am leaving the country next week they had to do it earlier.</p>
<p>Berry had prepared a nice document summing up the things I have done in Harmelen during the 13 years as an animator. If you know me a little bit, then you know that this list was not so long‚Ä¶ The main point was that I have spent a lot of nights drinking a beer.
After that, he gave me the presents. The traditional present is one plate to put on the wall. I will surely take it with me Catalonia. Besides that I received a set of pens and a pin. It is the small things that I appreciate most‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Of course I arranged a box of beer afterwards, which reminds me of one more thing: I still have to pay my bill!</p>

<p>MJ and I have received a lot of nice presents, mostly typical Dutch products as drop, hagelslag, erwtensoep and pepernoten. Some people also took the occasion to get rid of their last pesetas.</p>

			 <p>One week of holidays is not a lot if you have to travel back and forth to the other end of Europe.</p>
<p>Last week, we have spent the whole weekend packing my stuff. The result was a huge pile of boxes, of which everybody doubted it would fit into the car. On Sunday evening we removed the couches from the car and started fitting everything in it. To our surprise, there was some space left!!! So we quickly went back inside to get three more boxes which I intended to leave in Harmelen.</p>
<p>On Monday we left at 4 o&rsquo;clock at night to drive in one time to Lleida. Expected distance: 1600 kilometers. At half past nine at night we parked the car in the garage in Alpicat. Completely exhausted we made it just before the Catalan supper time!</p>
<p>Tuesday we took a rest and emptied the car, and on Wednesday we arranged some practical things as visiting a language school, washing the car, checking the oil and arranging some of my stuff (CD&rsquo;s!!!).</p>
<p>Thursday morning we left at 4:30 in the morning, with an almost empty car. The trip went a ot faster this time, but again we were exhausted.</p>
<p>And now I am here, while all my stuff is over there. I will have to wait two more weeks before I will leave Harmelen definitivly.</p>

			 <p>Just a few more days to go! My room in Harmelen is turning little by little into a big mess. I am emptying my wardrobes, spreading everything out on the floor, putting stuff into boxes. Along the way I find back things of which I couldn&rsquo;t even remember their existence.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine I just have to read those old letters, go through the old pictures, look into the old magazines‚Ä¶</p>
<p>In between there is of course my daily life: getting up, going to work, meeting friends, talking with my parents and of course phoning with MJ. The days all seem so very short‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyway, four more days to go, and then everything has to be packed. I haven&rsquo;t decided yet the exact way to drive to Lleida. There are two options: drive over Paris ‚Äì Toulouse ‚Äì through the Pyrenees or Lyon ‚Äì Perpignan. The first option is shorter, but with smaller roads and the second option has better roads, but over a longer distance.</p>

<p>Ik heb ondertussen weer twee fantastische weekenden gehad. Van 10 tot en met 12 september ben ik in Vlaanderen geweest voor de startdag van de Chiro. Op vrijdagavond heb ik meegeholpen met opbouwen (samen met 400! anderen), en op de dag zelf was ik gewoon deelnemer (samen met ongeveer 4000 Chiro&rsquo;s). Na afloop had Kristel nog een geweldig programma voor ons in petto: een feest van de CM in Antwerpen en op zondag een bezoek aan de meiden van Chiro Woka, waar ik me als Tipper helemaal uitgeleefd heb.</p>
<p>Afgelopen weekend was er weer eens een bureaumeeting van de Fimcap, deze keer in Zuidoostbeemster, Nederland dus. Het was een nuttige en erg gezellige bijeenkomst. Na afloop nog een aantal van mijn Europeese vrienden het &lsquo;echte&rsquo; Amsterdam laten zien, inclusief knokpartij op de wallen.</p>

<p>Ik ben nu al een paar weekenden niet meer thuis geweest. Twee weken geleden ben ik met Marco, Dagmar, Chris en Wim naar Pinkpop geweest. Vooral de twee &lsquo;rustige&rsquo; dagen vond ik erg goed. Muzikale hoogtepunten waren voor mij de Postman, de Heideroosjes, Skunk Anansi, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion en Soulfly. Het was weer eens zo&rsquo;n weekend die maar niet gezellig wilde worden&hellip;</p>
<p>Afgelopen weekend was het Jong Nederland Harmelen ouderweekend. Lekkere twee dagen lang met die oudjes spelletjes spelen! Ik moet zeggen, ze waren een stuk erger dan hun kinderen. Alle kindsheid kwam weer boven, ze waren √©cht een paar dagen los.</p>
<p>Hoogtepunt was uiteraard het feest op zaterdagavond: ik zie de dames nog ronddansen met verf op hun gezicht en theezakjes aan hun oren.</p>

			 <p>Vandaag een dagje vrij om weer bij te komen van weer een geweldig Euroforum in Seitenstetten in Oostenrijk.</p>
<p>Echt waar: het was weer een &ldquo;toppertje&rdquo;. Vooral de workshops over vredeseducatie en omgaan met meervoudig gehandicapte kinderen waren erg interessant.</p>
<p>Ik heb weer veel geleerd, veel nieuwe vriendschappen opgedaan en veel lol gehad.</p>

			 <p>Hoewel ik het errug druk heb, toch nog een klein verhaaltje over afgelopen weekend.</p>
<p>Ik ben namelijk in K√∂ln geweest om samen met mensen van KJG, Chiro en Jong Nederland te brainstormen over EuroContact 1999. EuroContact is een Europese activiteit voor jongeren van 16‚Äì18 jaar en wordt komend jaar bij Strasbourg gehouden.</p>
<p>Ik moet zeggen dat we dit weekend een hoop gedaan hebben en dat we dus volop aan de slag kunnen om er een geweldige activiteit van te maken. O ja, daarnaast hebben we natuurlijk ook gefeest.</p>
<p>Verder was er afgelopen zondag weer het volleybaltoernooi van het District Utrecht. Ook dit was weer errug gezellig; leuk om iedereen weer eens te zien. Wij van Harmelen gingen voor de (niet offici√´le) prijs voor het meest verbijsterende T-shirt. We hadden nieuwe T-shirts met een visje en de tekst: ‚ÄúEr is hoop&hellip; er is Jong Nederland Harmelen!‚Äù</p>
<p>Daarnaast hebben we tussen neus en lippen door ook nog even de worst voor de laatste plaats weggesleept.</p>

			 <p>Ik ben weer een beetje bijgekomen van afgelopen weekend.</p>
<p>De landelijke Nacht van 16+ werd namelijk in Harmelen gehouden, dus ik ben van zaterdagavond 20:00 uur tot zondagochtend 08:00 uur bezig geweest om al die &lsquo;pubers&rsquo; üòâ bezig te houden.</p>
<p>&rsquo;s Ochtends vroeg hebben we met een paar man van Harmelen een verfrissend potje kwalleballen/rugby gehouden op het onder water gelopen activiteitenterrein.</p>
<p>Errug koud, maar daarna waren we wel weer helemaal wakker om met frisse moed aan het opruimen te beginnen.</p>

<p>Ik heb (voor de vierde keer dit jaar) een ontsteking in mijn gezicht. Met andere woorden: ik zie er weer eens niet uit.</p>
<p>Vanmiddag van de huisarts (want voor de dermatoloog ben ik geen spoedgeval) medicijnen gehad waar de geplande aanval op Kosovo niets bij is.</p>
<p>Ik hoop dus dat ik er binnen een paar dagen weer vanaf ben.</p>

			 <p>Oeps, ik merk dat ik deze pagina niet echt goed bijgehouden heb. Ik had natuurlijk allang wat moeten vertellen over mijn vakantie in Lesotho enzo. Om het goed te maken het volgende:</p>
<p>Afgelopen weekend was er weer eens een echte kaderschouw. We zijn met ongeveer 20 man uit Harmelen gegaan. Op het programma stonden workshops rond intimiteiten, een informatiemarkt, veel cabaret en natuurlijk feest.</p>
<p>Ik heb nog steeds last van mijn stembanden, en voel me nog erg moe (weinig geslapen natuurlijk).</p>

			 <p>De mensen die mij de laatste tijd nog gezien hebben, hebben waarschijnlijk al gemerkt dat het niet helemaal goed met me gaat. Ik heb namelijk nogal last van een allergie.</p>
<p>Waarvoor ik allergisch ben is vooralsnog niet duidelijk, maar ik heb erg veel uitslag rond mijn ogen en op mijn armen en benen. Als gevolg van de jeuk slaap ik erg slecht &rsquo;s nachts, waardoor ik constant erg moe ben.</p>
<p>Ik hoop dat het snel weer over gaat!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>En wat doe je dan in zo&rsquo;n week? Gewoon: heel veel bekijken, winkelen, mensen kijken, wat rond slenteren en kletsen.</p>
