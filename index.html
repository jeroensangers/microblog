<p>Only now, five months later, have I started looking at the new features in this version and I really love them! üíï</p>

<p>I disconnected the app from <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> and <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> (my feed server and read later service) and started using the built-in iCloud Feeds and iCloud Read Later services.</p>

<p>But the biggest improvement is <a href="https://bionic-reading.com/en/en-insight/">Bionic Reading</a>! Added to Reeder in version 4 (2019), it looks weird but actually works! I read with more focus and attention and am less distracted.</p>

<p>I switch Bionic Reading off when I triage my feeds, but when I switch too the Read Later section I turn it on for some slow and focused reading.</p>

<p>Have you tried Bionic Reading in Reeder or any other app?</p>

<p>I see a bright future for hyperscheduling tools, since they are the easiest way to be aware of the volume of current commitments. Timeblocking can quickly turn into a rescheduling Tetris, but automated tools such as Sorted and SkedPal eliminate this issue.</p>

<p>That said, I really liked the sorted interface.  They have some innovative ways to select and modify multiple items.</p>

<p>However, there is one important feature I am missing: <strong>due dates</strong>. I can work without do dates, but being able to control my deadlines is essential for me.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Whenever I write on my iPad, there are two problems which drive me nuts. Today I will explain one of these issues.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am well aware that this is a very first-world problem, but I expect Apple to care about the little details.</p>

<p>The issue arrises when I am writing a text and need to insert a special character, such as the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign. On my iPhone I can find this symbol in a logical, easy to understand way.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/b349a757ac.png" width="250" height="143" alt="iPhone keyboard 1" /></p>

<p>Since the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign is not on the main keyboard, I tap the ‚Äò123‚Äô button to go to the numerical keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/82a0c27b12.png" width="250" height="144" alt="iPhone keyboard 2" /></p>

<p>There are some characters on this keyboard, but not the symbol I was looking for. However, where the ‚Äò123‚Äô previously was, I now see ‚Äò#+=‚Äô, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign. There it is:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/90237d7715.png" width="250" height="143" alt="iPhone keyboard 3" /></p>

<p>That was easy and intuitive. Now let&rsquo;s see what usually happens when I try to do the same basic thing on my iPad:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/462719c382.png" width="682" height="270" alt="iPad keyboard 1" /></p>

<p>Though there are more characters available, the ‚Äò+‚Äô symbol is not there. Yes, I know I can swipe down the ‚Äò√ß‚Äô key, but for the sake of this argument pretend that is not the case, as not all characters are available to swipe down and my fingers fail in swiping far enough about 20% of the time.</p>

<p>Just like on the iPhone, I have a button labeled ‚Äò.?123‚Äô to get to the numerical keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/a1b38ca25e.png" width="682" height="272" alt="iPad keyboard 2a" /></p>

<p>On the numerical keyboard I once again see the ‚Äò#+=‚Äô button, clearly indicating that there is another keyboard with more characters, including the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/cebc4b53ea.png" width="682" height="271" alt="iPad keyboard 3" /></p>

<p>And here is my issue, since the ‚Äò+‚Äô button is nowhere to be seen on the third keyboard. What went wrong?
The answer is on the second screen, so lets get back:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/7904b61438.png" width="682" height="272" alt="iPad keyboard 2b" /></p>

<p>The problem is caused by the label of the button which brings us to the special characters keyboard. The button is labeled as ‚Äò#+=‚Äô just like the iPhone, but in this case all three characters shown on the button are already on the previous keyboard.</p>

<p>If Apple would simply change the characters shown on the button to characters actually on the third keyboard (I propose ‚Äò&gt;|^‚Äô), my monkey brain would not make the mistake to press it when I&rsquo;m looking for the ‚Äò+‚Äô character.</p>

The brain is the organ that named itself and created all that we are discussing but it is a odd thing. It takes over 20 years of education before it is even remotely useful to an employer or society. To attribute ‚Äòintelligence‚Äô to he organ is to forge that, compared to machines, it can‚Äôt pay attention for long, forgets most of what you teach it, is sexist, racist, full of cognitive biases, sleeps 8 hours a day, can‚Äôt network, can‚Äôt upload, can‚Äôt download and, here‚Äôs the fatal objection -&nbsp;&nbsp;it dies. This should not be the gold standard for intelligence, as it is an idiosyncratic organ that evolved for circumstances other than those we find ourselves in.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I just deleted <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a> from my phone. I have tried it for two weeks and have come to the conclusion that the platform in its current state does not provide any value to me.</p>

<p>The first week I tried using it as intended.</p>

<p>I betrayed the privacy of my contacts by uploading their information to the Clubhouse server and followed all of those who were already on the platform.</p>

<p>The first few days I listened in on a few rooms to understand how the platform works. Since about half of the rooms discuss about Clubhouse, this was easy enough. Then I went to the second stage, and once in a while, when I thought I had something useful to share I requested stage access. I even met a few new people.</p>

<p>After a week the constant stream of notifications started to bother me, so I dialled down the notification frequency to ‚ÄúVery infrequent‚Äú.</p>

<p>This week I also started thinking about why Clubhouse is such a success and why I don&rsquo;t feel it is a good fit for me.</p>

<p>First, the barrier to enter is very low. You&rsquo;re immediately welcomed by your friends, even if you didn&rsquo;t upload your contacts, since your friends already did. You can just enter and leave rooms until you find something interesting.</p>

<p>For me the biggest issue has been finding interesting rooms. It may be because of my contacts, but I found that in most rooms they talk either about what is Clubhouse, about online marketing or about both. Sometimes I found an interesting room in the ‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù list, but always at an inconvenient time. Furthermore, you can add future rooms to you calendar, but I&rsquo;d rather simply receive a notification within the app when the room starts.</p>

<p>I have met some people who spend several hours a day in Clubhouse, but that is not how I want to use social networks. I want to connect at a time that is convenient for me, and have an interesting conversation at that very moment.
Ah, and I prefer conversations with a small group of people instead of big rooms of listeners.</p>

<p>As it is right now, Clubhouse is set up as a conference center, with a few people speaking on stage and many listeners. I would prefer to see a version set up as a bar, where I can join a small table where everyone participates.</p>

<p>Until then, goodbye Clubhouse.</p>

         	<p>The past two days I have been hanging around in <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a>.</p>

<p>So far I like it, though I would like to see a broader spectrum of conversation themes. So far, since the platform is full with online marketers, the main topics are &ldquo;What is Clubhouse?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can I use this platform for marketing my business?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think audio is the perfect medium for establishing conversations, since it&rsquo;s more personal and faster to produce than written text and it&rsquo;s easier to get professional quelity than video.</p>

<p>That said, Clubhouse is a closed environment. Surely, soon there will be Clubhouse clones in many forms, but I doubt any open platform will get enough traction to pass Clubhouse as the most popular option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to have a conversation with you on Clubhouse. You can find me as always as <a href="https://micro.blog/JeroenSangers">@JeroenSangers</a>.</p>

In any given moment, an urgency that feels like an emergency gives us the permission to abandon our systems and simply dive in and fix it, as only we can. And this permission is precisely why we get stuck, precisely why the next urgency is likely to appear tomorrow.

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html">23 years of blogging</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-11-10 16:42:11 &#43;0200">Nov 10, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>23 years ago, I decided to add a page to my website where I explain what has been going on in my life. A few years later I learned that there was a name for such a page: a <strong>web log</strong>.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since then.</p>

<p>I have changed the blogging engine several times. The first page was made in Microsoft FrontPage, followed by hand-crafted Server Side Includes (SSI), the NewsPro CGI script and Movable Type, my favorite blogging engine of all times. Later, I decided that tweaking servers, databases and scripts was no longer a good use of my time, so I parked the blog on the hosted version of WordPress. And finally, this year I made the switch to Micro.blog.</p>

<p>Also the contents of the blogposts have changed in those years. Starting with a monthly post in Dutch summing up previous months activities in my life, I changed to writing in English when I migrated to Spain and wanted to keep an international group of friends up-to-date on my life here. When I got bored explaining my life I slowly shifted to a mixture of technology, humor, music and web standards. There also have been several years with hardly any new posts, as I focused on my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href="https://canasto.es">el Canasto</a>. As of last year, I am back to blogging again (mostly in English, but sometimes in Dutch or Spanish), (un)focused on a mixture of personal themes, interesting stuff I found on the web and some technology.</p>

<p>As for the future of this blog, seen my recent interest in publishing more (I even wish to publish daily), I think it is safe to say that the blog won‚Äôt go anywhere. Now that I have kept it alive for 23 years, I surely want to make sure to celebrate its 25th anniversary in two years.</p>

         	<p>In all the years of its existence, I have used several tools to maintain this site. From the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft FrontPage</li>
<li>NewsPro</li>
<li>Movable Type</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
</ul>

<p>Today marks the start of a new era, since I now officially joined the <a href="http://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> movement and migrated my 23-year old personal blog to <a href="http://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>.</p>

<p>The import went flawless, and it was easy to set-up.</p>

<p>My only gripe is that I am still waiting for HTTPS to be activated, since appears to be done manually by the staff.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t request HTTPS while I haven&rsquo;t changed my DNS setting. This means that I&rsquo;m having a little bit of downtime, since all visitors will get an error message while HTTPS is not activated.</p>

<p>For me it&rsquo;s no issue, since I don‚Äôt get many visitors anymore (this site peaked fourteen years ago).</p>

<p>One of the most expensive things a service business or freelancer can do is promise that work will be done by a certain day. Which is something we need to do, of course, but we should charge appropriately. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be done soon,‚Äù should be way cheaper than, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be done at exactly 11 am on Tuesday.‚Äù</p>
<p>And one of the most important things we can do to focus our energy and commitment is be prepared to promise a date certain. It sharpens everything.</p>

         	<p>This morning I was checking my data in the health app, when I noticed two new sections: Symptoms and Mobility.</p>

<p>Both could be useful, but as a walking enthusiast, the Mobility metrics caught my eye:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/f46da5cb41.png" width="337" height="600" alt="iOS 14 Step length" /></p>

<p>Four of the new mobility types, <strong>Step Length</strong>, <strong>Walking Asymmetry</strong>, <strong>Walking Speed</strong>, and <strong>Double Support Time</strong> have a paragraph similar to the screenshot above.</p>

<p>That means that no external device is needed to collect this data, as long a I carry my iPhone in my pocket, which I always do.</p>

<p>One question remains though: How can I activate this function? I found no options in the settings. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait for the final release to find out‚Ä¶</p>

Influencers make us feel that productivity is important, and yet they rarely define the term, let alone helpfully. For example, David Allen‚Äôs Getting Things Done (GTD) book, which became very popular in software circles, uses the term productivity very loosely. Many of the core examples in the GTD method relate to general activities such as cleaning one‚Äôs garage as opposed to working with knowledge. And the GTD principles have no reference to cognitive science, even though cognitive science is the modern interdisciplinary science of understanding the information processing we do in our brains, with or without the aid of technology.

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/07/02/reorganising-my-rss.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-07-02 13:10:06 &#43;0200">Jul 2, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last week I started writing up my <strong>Personal Knowledge Management Workflow</strong> as part of that workflow.</p>

<p>You know, the best notes are about note taking, just like the most popular blogs are about blogging and the most popular YouTube videos are about creating YouTube videos.</p>

<p>Back to my notes.</p>

<p>When describing the concept of <strong>garbage in = garbage out</strong>¬†I realised that it had been ages since I pruned the RSS feeds I consult each day during breakfast.</p>

<p>So I left my notes to take a deep dive into my <a href="http://inoreader.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inoreader</a> account. This turned out to be a multi-hour project, so I chunked the task as any productive human would do.</p>

<p>Then, when checking <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>¬†between two chunks, I ran into a post called <a href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/feed-reading-by-social-distance/">Feed Reading By Social Distance</a> by Ton Zijlstra. I loved the idea!</p>

<p>Until now I have always organised my feeds by¬†<em>interestingness</em>, using numbered folders:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Quality control:</strong>¬†my own publications which I always want to check first.</li>
    <li><strong>Interesting:</strong>¬†my favourite blogs which I want to read whenever I can.</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk:</strong>¬†the rest of the posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Triage: </strong>new subscriptions that I want to try out before moving them to ‚ÄòBulk‚Äô.</li>
    <li><strong>Whenever I have the time</strong>: some high volume feeds that I usually skipped.</li>
</ol>

<p>After reading Tom&rsquo;s post, I first renamed all my feeds with the author name. As Tom said: feeds express a personal relation.</p>

<p>I unsubscribed from most business and group blogs, with a few exceptions for some blogs run by two or three people I know well.</p>

<p>Then I dedicated several hours to reorganise the 242 remaining feeds into social distance based folders:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>My Publications</strong>: this folder actually has number 0, but in HTML it is complicated to create numbered lists not starting at 1 and being strictly sequential.</li>
    <li><strong>Close Contacts</strong>: People I know well and with whom I have a relation spanning several years.</li>
    <li><strong>Dunbar's Tribe</strong>: feeds from people I know in real life, through digital exchanges or by having followed them for over a decade (as long as they also publish some personal information).</li>
    <li><strong>Outer circle</strong>: interesting writing by people I don't know at all.</li>
    <li><strong>The Fire Hose</strong>: some feeds by businesses. I assigned number 99 to this folder to indicate the correct social distance.</li>
</ol>

<p>While reviewing all those feeds I also made sure they are all configured to use the ‚Äòhttps‚Äô protocol, that they use the current domain name (some blogs moved from using the platform&rsquo;s subdomain to having their own domain) and to use a current feed address.</p>

<p>Speaking of the latter, it surprised me to see that several blogs, including some high volume sites, still channel their feeds through <a href="https://feedburner.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedburner</a>.</p>

<p>So there we are, all feeds organised and read. Not the only thing I can do to procrastinate a bit more is write about it on my blog‚Ä¶</p>

Even when researchers compared lonely people with purpose to social butterflies without it, purpose came out on top.

         	<p>I am worried about my fellow Dutch citizens. The general idea in the Netherlands is that they have the coronavirus under control, but they have not.</p>

<p>The death numbers are following Italy&rsquo;s numbers and today arrived at the point in which Italy went on lock down (which was already rather late).</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/357ece94f7.png" width="600" height="437" alt="Coronavirus deaths" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, the Netherlands are a small country. This amount of deaths has placed them at the 5th position on the ranking of deaths per 100.000 habitants (after San Marino, Italy, Spain and Andorra).</p>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the Dutch government want to take action?</p>

How about if we replace mission statements with <em>invitation statements</em> instead? Invitations are much more agreeable. Invite people to participate in your vision to create a better future, but don‚Äôt push your vision on the whole world because people will fight you on that. If you force your mission onto people without consent, so much of your otherwise creative energy will be wasted on defending yourselves eventually, and you‚Äôll deserve that kind of response.

I say all this to suggest that, perhaps, email is not ‚Äúbroken‚Äù but the way we are using it is. Perhaps there is a solution that could make things better for you that doesn‚Äôt involve a new app or service. Perhaps, if you hate it, in changing the way you approach it you‚Äôll find a way to love it again.

We live in a world that values action and where back to back meetings are a badge of productivity. Quarterly targets mean that we tend to be focused on the next thing on our to-do-list rather than looking back to evaluate how the last thing we‚Äôve just completed could be improved. Few of us routinely take time out to reflect on past events. However, by missing out on opportunities for reflection you may be making yourself less effective than you could be. Reflection brings three distinctive advantages.

         	<p>Far too many people are unaware of the real consequences of giving up their privacy. As Carissa V√©liz writes, privacy is not a private problem, privacy is a collective issue.</p>

<p><blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Privacy is a collective concern" data-author="Carissa V√©liz" cite="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/privacy/2019/10/privacy-collective-concern">
Because we are intertwined in ways that make us vulnerable to each other, we are responsible for each other‚Äôs privacy. I might, for instance, be extremely careful with my phone number and physical address. But if you have me as a contact in your mobile phone and then give access to companies to that phone, my privacy will be at risk regardless of the precautions I have¬†taken. This is why you shouldn‚Äôt store more sensitive data than necessary in your <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/people-please-dont-store-private-data-address-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address book</a>, post photos of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2019/jan/22/why-you-shouldnt-post-photos-of-friends-without-permission-social-media-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a> without their permission, or even expose your own privacy unnecessarily.

<p><blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Living according to your hierarchy of values" data-author="Derek Sivers" cite="https://sive.rs/vls1">
Once you realize that one value is more important to you than another, you have to ask yourself if you‚Äôre living accordingly.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs ultimately more important to you?
<ul>
    <li>Learning? Or creating?</li>
    <li>Money? Or time?</li>
    <li>Expanding? Or focusing?</li>

Once you know which takes top place, consider taking it to an extreme, to its logical conclusion, and optimizing your entire life around that top priority, letting go of almost everything else.

  When we told our guide that we didn't want to go to all the tourist places he took us instead to the places where they take tourists who say that they don't want to go to tourist places. These places are, of course, full of tourists. Which is not to say that we weren't tourists every bit as much as the others, but it does highlight the irony that everything you go to see is changed by the very action of going to see it, which is the sort of problem which physicists have been wrestling with for most of this century.

<p>I am no scientific in any way, but still remember the importance of the above statement from my chemistry classes. As an example, when you want to test the pH of a liquid using a piece of litmus paper, you have to make sure that the amount of liquid is large enough to eliminate the effects of the pH change inducted by the piece of litmus paper. In other words, using litmus paper to test the pH degree of a drop of liquid has a huge error margin.</p>

<p>I have this principle in mind with most things I measure. The inclusion of a piece of JavaScript on the pages of my web site in order to have Google Analytics collect data about my visitors has an effect on the user experience: the page loads a little bit slower. However, Google&rsquo;s infrastructure is fast enough so that the increase in load time is hardly noticeable.</p>

<h2>URL shorteners</h2>

<p>Many Twitter users also want to measure the efficiency and popularity of their tweets. The most common method of doing this is by using an intermediate server, the &lsquo;URL shortener&rsquo;, which registers each visit to the destination site.</p>

<p>In the first years of Twitter, URL shorteners such as <a href="http://bitly.com">bit.ly</a> were necessary to prevent long URLs from using too many of the available 140 characters in a tweet. However, in 2011Twitter implemented their <strong>own URL shortener</strong> inside their service so that each URL, including the ones passed through another shortener, only use 20 characters. Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>

<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet. Once again, this was true in the past, but nowadays Twitter gives <strong>excellent statistics</strong> about the number of favourites, retweets and answers to each tweet on their <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com">statistics page</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between Twitter&rsquo;s own shortener and external services is <strong>transparency</strong>. When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you&rsquo;re linking to if you don&rsquo;t use an external shortener &ndash; and therefore just Twitter&rsquo;s service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>

<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <strong>Single Point of Failure</strong> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>

<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <em>expectation</em> was that tweets with shortened links get <strong>clicked less</strong> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>

<h2>Experimenting</h2>

<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code></p>

<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href="http://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>

<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <a href="http://tweko.com">Tweko</a> service, which was invoked by adding the <code>#tweko</code> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>

<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>

<h3>Tweet 1 -- Shortener:</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es">C√≥mo ganar 2 horas productivas al d√≠a en un instante&#010;<a href="http://t.co/2iZFFblXsn">http://bit.ly/1c8gCuw</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/371931328067153920">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>

<h3>Tweet 2 -- No Shortener:</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es"><p>C√≥mo ganar 2 horas productivas al d√≠a en un instante&#010;<a href="http://t.co/ekVvviOOni">http://canasto.es/2010/03/como-g...</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/372006931189481472">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>

<h2>The results</h2>

<p><p>After a few weeks I decided to have a look at the statistics in Google Analytics. I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named &lsquo;TestShortener&rsquo; to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field &lsquo;ad content&rsquo; as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Ad content</th>
      <th>Visits</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shortener</td>
      <td>382</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NoShortener</td>
      <td>438</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>820</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>

<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>

<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95">calculate</a>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Ad content</th>
      <th># successes</th>
      <th># trials</th>
      <th>Confidence interval</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shortener</td>
      <td>382</td>
      <td>7000</td>
      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NoShortener</td>
      <td>438</td>
      <td>7000</td>
      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).</p>

<h2>My conclusion</h2>

<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>

         	<p>Version 2 of the popular OS X task management application <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> is about to be released today. I have been testing the beta versions for some time and have seen how the software matured little by little.</p>

<p>Version 2 defers from the previous version in almost every aspect; it contains new features such as the review and forecast perspectives and also the user interface has been modernised. Especially the latter gave rise to many discussions on the support forums about the <a href="http://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/how-can-the-data-density-be-improved/86">data density of the new design</a>. Eventually, the Omni Group <a href="http://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/alternate-layout-which-displays-everything-on-one-line-with-status-circles-on-the-left/1697">published a <em>hack</em></a> to change the layout of the task list back to a table of tasks more similar to Omnifocus 1.</p>

<p>This made me wonder what other &lsquo;secret&rsquo; configuration options exist. So far, I have been able to compile the following list.</p>

<p>All configuration options are activated by opening a special URL starting with <code>omnifocus:///change-preference</code> in your browser, which opens Omnifocus and applies the configuration. The URLs in the list are clickable to apply the configuration directly form this post.</p>

<h3>Alternate layout</h3>

<p>Use <a href="///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact</code></a> to switch to the compact layout, which only uses one line per task.  Note that this layout is experimental and still has some issues. To return to the default layout you can use <a href="///change-preference?ContentLayout"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout</code></a>. The alternative layout looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/f8c1ad875e.png" width="600" height="95" alt="Alternative layout for Omnifocus" /></p>

<h3>Hide empty contexts in the main outline</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in a perspective grouped by context, you&rsquo;ll see that empty perspectives will also show up in the main outline, to mike it easier to reassign tasks by dragging them to another context. If you would rather not see them, you can remove the empty contexts from the main outline with <a href="///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false</code></a>. You can also pass the parameter <code>true</code> to reactivate the empty contexts.</p>

<h3>Hide On Hold projects in forecast view</h3>

<p>If you put a project on hold, it&rsquo;s tasks will still show up in the forecast view. The reasoning is that even though the project is on hold, its tasks still have a due date. If you prefer not to see those tasks on the forecast view, disable them using <a href="///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false</code></a>. Use <a href="///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold</code></a> to restore the default setting.</p>

<h3>Reorganise the side bar</h3>

<p>This &lsquo;hack&rsquo; is a little bit more complicated. The issue was that the order of the perspectives in the sidebar could not be reorganised. Note that in the final release the default perspectives behave just like any other perspective, and can be organised in any way you like it. However, if you want to freak out with URL schemes, this is the way:</p>

<p>The default perspectives are on top (Inbox, Projects, Contexts&hellip;), followed by any starred perspectives. To add another perspective, you first have to star the perspective and open the URL <a href="///change-preference?SidebarTabs"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs</code></a> to get a list of the current tabs. Note the ID of the starred perspective, <code>hdDT8UyDkVe</code> in this case:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/2935404eb4.png" width="534" height="452" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you know the ID of your custom perspective, you can define the order of the tabs with <a href="///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)</code></a></p>

<h3>Send clippings directly to the inbox</h3>

<p>Whenever you <em>clip</em> something from another application, the Quick Entry window shows up so you can specify some further meta-information about the task &ndash; project, context, dates&hellip; &ndash; and change the task description. If you would rather send the clipped information directly to the Omnifocus inbox, use the configuration URL <a href="///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Sync settings</h3>

<p>There are two setting for configuring the synchronisation interval. First, you can set the maximum sync time &ndash;in seconds &ndash; with <a href="///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600</code></a> (this sets the maximum to 10 minutes). Use <a href="///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync</code></a> to restore the default setting of one hour.</p>

<p>The other option is for setting how long after making an edit Omnifocus should synchronise. The URL is <a href="///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15</code></a> and <a href="///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync</code></a> to get back to the default setting of one minute.</p>

<h3>Toolbar colour</h3>

<p>If you have setup your mac to use the &lsquo;Graphite&rsquo; appearance instead of the default &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; theme, Omnifocus will have black and white icons in the toolbar instead of the modern coloured icons. If you prefer this to be different, you can use <a href="///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua</code></a> to force the use of coloured buttons or <a href="///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite</code></a> to get the black and white icons in the toolbar. As usual, with <a href="///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint</code></a> you&rsquo;ll go back to the default setting.</p>

<h3>Set defer date when dragging a task in Forecast view</h3>

<p>This option was contributed by Colter in the comments of this post. When in Forecast view, you can drag a task to another date in the calendar to change its due date. You can change the defer date instead by holding the ‚åò key. If you would like to change the defer date by default, you can use the URL <a href="///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Change the project hierarchy separator character</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using folders, OmniFocus will show the complete path in the project selection drop-down list using a colon as the hierarchy separation character, e.g. <code>Personal : Finance</code>. You can configure the character used to separate the project hierarchy with the URL <a href="%20"><code>omnifocus:///change-setting?OFMNamedObjectHierarchicalNameSeparator=%20:%20</code></a> (note that <code>%20</code> is the code for a space).</p>

<p>Please leave a comment if you know of any other configuration option for Omnifocus 2; I will keep this post up-to-date.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In preparation for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a> launch in autumn, I have been thinking about its impact on my use of Apple services. Our family uses several <em>iDevices</em> and the better syncing options offered by iCloud will be very welcome. However, I have some concerns about purchasing and synching.</p>

<p>At this moment I use two different accounts to access Apple&rsquo;s services: I have a regular Apple ID which I use for purchasing Apps and home sharing media, and I also have a <a href="http://www.me.com/">MobileMe</a> account for synching data between my Macbook and the iPhone. The MobileMe account is used just by me, while all iDevices share the same Apple ID for the obvious reason that I don&rsquo;t want to purchase apps twice. Furthermore, by using two separate accounts we are able to access all iTunes libraries from the AppleTV, without being obliged to synchronize calendars as well, as those are being synched using another account. In short: the Apple ID identifies the family/home, while MobileMe is used to identify a person.</p>

<p>When Apple activates iCloud, my Apple ID will also become the <em>token</em> for synching information, which is a problem for me. I would like to continue using the Apple ID to make purchases for the whole family and stream media between the devices of our family, while on the other hand each member needs a personal ID for synching calendars, mail accounts and other personal data. When Apple closes MobileMe I will be forced to sync my calendar through iCloud, but my wife has no interest at all in my appointments (and vice versa).</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to find out, iCloud will not offer such granularity. I assume that my situation is quite common and that many families with several devices will face the same issue. Does anybody know a solution for this problem, or do we simply have to wait for the final version of iCloud and hope that Apple has already a solution?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2011/06/28/googles-step-verification.html">Google&#39;s 2-step verification horror</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2011/06/28/googles-step-verification.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-06-28 16:58:01 &#43;0200">Jun 28, 2011</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Google has released a new security measure to help you protect your ever increasing amount of data stored on their servers. This <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsAuthConfig">2-step authentication</a> means that when you log in to your Google account with your username and password, you will receive a code by SMS message. Only after entering this code you will be able to get to your data.</p>

<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data on Google&rsquo;s servers (I hardly ever use Gmail or Google Docs, mainly just <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>) I thought that it was a good idea to activate this service &ndash; better safe than sorry, right?</p>

<h3>Activating 2-step verification</h3>

<p>So I went ahead and activated the service. The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <em>backup verification codes</em>. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky &lsquo;finder&rsquo; the possibility to get into your Google account <strong>without</strong> needing the SMS confirmation.</p>

<p>I immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that &ndash;with the current roaming rates in Europe&ndash; they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!</p>

<h3>External applications</h3>

<p>Satisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:</p>

<blockquote>
  Some mobile or desktop applications that work outside of a browser aren't yet compatible with 2-step verification. These applications are hard-coded to ask for a username and password, and do not prompt for a verification code. If you want one of these applications to access your Google Account, you must enter an application-specific password, not your Google Account password, when asked for a password.
</blockquote>

<p>I went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for iPhone, FlipBook, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for iPad, <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.</p>

<h3>Does it make sense?</h3>

<p>After a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.</p>

<p>I know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google&rsquo;s servers. To me it makes no sense that &ndash;even though one application increased its security&ndash; the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.</p>

<p>I finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can&rsquo;t use Google anymore as my <a href="http://smarterware.org/6286/how-to-set-up-openid-on-your-own-domain">OpenID provider</a>, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web &ndash;those that require registration&ndash; I want to comment on. Too much of a hassle to be functional&hellip;</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2011/06/23/welcome-back-to.html">Welcome back to brain tags!</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After some weeks of work &ndash;though I only spend 1-2 hours every week on this project&ndash; I am re-releasing <a href="http://braintags.com">brain tags</a>. I have lost the count of the <em>version numbers</em> of this blog, but is should probably the 6th or 7th overhaul. I am very excited about it, as I see it as a fresh start with some important changes:</p>

<h3>A new CMS</h3>

<p>After many, many years, I have exported all data from my old <a href="http://movabletype.com">Movable Type Pro</a> installation, and installed a fresh copy of <a href="http://openmelody.org">Melody</a> on a fresh new account. For those who are not familiar with those two applications, Melody is a fork Movable Type version 4.</p>

<p>I choose to move to Melody for several reasons. First of all, I was not completely happy with the latest versions of Movable Type, which added a lot of unneeded bloat, such as the possibility to create <em>sites</em>. In fact, Movable Type obliges you to first create a <em>site</em> to be able to create a weblog. But the biggest reason is the fact that support for Movable Type is decreasing, now that the <a href="http://sixapart.com">owner</a> is focussed on advertising, and development on Movable Type takes place in Japan.</p>

<p>Melody was created by two former employees of <a href="http://sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> &ndash;one of them was product manager for Movable Type&ndash; and a very active community member. They have already been able to solve a lot of the main issues in Movable Type in Melody, and I simply trust more in them than in the current developers of Movable Type.</p>

<p>A final note on the change: while both Melody and Movable Type can handle multiple blogs and I traditionally have managed all my blogs from a single installation, I am now separating them again. This way I can make my customizations without making my other blogs more complex. It also gives me a way to test out things.</p>

<h3>A new theme</h3>

<p>Melody comes with a very nice minimalistic theme as the default theme, <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/516">DePo Clean</a>, and I decided to keep it. For the moment I haven&rsquo;t personalized the templates, though I did fix some minor bugs in the theme. Once I figure out how to make <code>diff</code> files, I will probably submit the patches to the Melody developers.</p>

<p>I do have a list of wishes and desires for the theme, so don&rsquo;t be surprised when things change over time.</p>

<h3>Comments are disabled</h3>

<p>Even though the combined Akismet and Typepad spam filters are very effective, I still had to deal with several comments in the moderation queue every week. Since nowadays there are plenty of other ways to express your opinion, I have disabled the comments function. If you want to share your opinion, feel free to send me a [tweet]<a href="http://twitter.com/JeroenSangers">6</a> or <a href="http://jeroensangers.com/Acerca-de-Jeroen/Contacto">mail</a>.</p>

<h3>Less images, more text</h3>

<p>When importing the old entries, I left out all decorational images. In the last years, I always accompanied each post with an image to make the post more attractive. Those images are now gone, you will only find images which help making my point. I want the focus to be on my words, and will also try to write longer, more thoughtful posts from now on.</p>

<p>I am very excited about this new start. What do you think?</p>

         	<p>Starting Monday May 23rd I will be moving this blog to a <a href="http://openmelody.org/">new platform</a> on a new server. This migration serves as a test for the migration of <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> and I will be trying out many different things in order to make the migration of <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> run smoothly.</p>
<p>Since my available time is limited and I can only dedicate a few hours per week to this test, I expect <strong>Brain Tags</strong> to be down during a significant period of time (read: days).</p>
<p>The reason for moving from my beloved <a href="http://movabletype.com/">Movable Type Pro</a> to <a href="http://openmelody.org/">Melody</a> (a fork of MT) is simply the fact that most of the community effort has moved to Melody and I expect a better support in the future now that the development of MT only takes place in Japan.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The mobile revolution is shaking up the software market. Old paradigms (bigger is better) disappear and new ones are created.</p>

<p>One area where these changes are specifically noticeable is the relation between applications and the file system.</p>

<p>Most computing environments are in what I call the second generation, where the file system is the dominant part of this relation. The file is the centre of our activities. To start working we open a file and the associated application is automatically launched. We only start application directly when we want to create a new file.</p>

<p>This has not always been like this: in the past (first generation) the applications were the core, where applications gave access to data on the mainframe or in databases. There are some situations where we work in applications without having any idea of the underlying file- or database structure. E-mail is one of the uses of this system.</p>

<p>Like I said, the mobile revolution is changing this again. Mobile operating systems as iOS, Symbian and Android give very limited access to the file system and force us back to the mainframe era. Even the <em>desktop</em> operating systems don&rsquo;t give you direct access to the file system anymore, but rather a virtual system mounted on top of the real file system.</p>

<p>It looks like file system abstraction is the future, but I don&rsquo;t think that applications will be the centre of our universe. The operating system of the future won&rsquo;t be centred on files or applications, but will use processes and tasks as the leading parameter.</p>

<p>In the operating system of the future, you will be able to say that you want to write, and a simple text editor will open. The moment you access more advanced editing functions, the application will automatically switch to another editing engine. Of course, you text is automatically saved and can be used in many ways.</p>

<p>In the future, operating systems will actually help you being productive. Trust me.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A recent trend in the blogosphere has been to add <strong>tweets as comments</strong> on posts. I understand where this comes from, as in general commenting on blog posts has decreased in favour of twittering. By adding all tweets mentioning your blog posts, your posts look more alive and will probably attract more readers.</p>

<p>Whenever I think about features for my blogs, I always ask myself what the value is for my readers. In the case of tweets as comments, I look for the answer based on my own experiences. It happens frequently that I find an interesting post with let&rsquo;s say 20 comments. When I finished reading this, otherwise interesting, blog post and get ready for participating in the conversation, I find out that there actually are only two real comments, followed by a tweet of the author and 17 retweets adding absolutely nothing to the post or the conversation. Immediately my motivation to participate in the conversation is gone and I quickly move on to the next blog.</p>

<p>Although in theory tweets are comments about your posts (or at least mentioning the post), they hardly ever contribute to the discussion. If you absolutely want to display the tweets on your blog post, go ahead, but don&rsquo;t mix them with the comments. If in the example above the tweets would have been separated from the comments and the blogs metadata would have shown me that the post has 2 comments and 18 tweets, I would not be so disappointed and probably would have left a comment as well.</p>

<p><strong>A comment is a comment and a tweet is a tweet</strong>.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Los derechos de autor no pueden situarse por encima de los derechos fundamentales</strong> de los ciudadanos, como el derecho a la privacidad, a la seguridad, a la presunci√≥n de inocencia, a la tutela judicial efectiva y a la libertad de expresi√≥n.</li>
    <li><strong>La suspensi√≥n de derechos fundamentales es y debe seguir siendo competencia exclusiva del poder judicial</strong>. Ni un cierre sin sentencia. Este anteproyecto, en contra de lo establecido en el art√≠culo 20.5 de la Constituci√≥n, pone en manos de un √≥rgano no judicial --un organismo dependiente del ministerio de Cultura--, la potestad de impedir a los ciudadanos espa√±oles el acceso a cualquier p√°gina web.</li>
    <li><strong>La nueva legislaci√≥n crear√° inseguridad jur√≠dica en todo el sector tecnol√≥gico espa√±ol</strong>, perjudicando uno de los pocos campos de desarrollo y futuro de nuestra econom√≠a, entorpeciendo la creaci√≥n de empresas, introduciendo trabas a la libre competencia y ralentizando su proyecci√≥n internacional.</li>
    <li><strong>La nueva legislaci√≥n propuesta amenaza a los nuevos creadores y entorpece la creaci√≥n cultural</strong>. Con Internet y los sucesivos avances tecnol√≥gicos se ha democratizado extraordinariamente la creaci√≥n y emisi√≥n de contenidos de todo tipo, que ya no provienen prevalentemente de las industrias culturales tradicionales, sino de multitud de fuentes diferentes.</li>
    <li><strong>Los autores, como todos los trabajadores, tienen derecho a vivir de su trabajo con nuevas ideas creativas</strong>, modelos de negocio y actividades asociadas a sus creaciones. Intentar sostener con cambios legislativos a una industria obsoleta que no sabe adaptarse a este nuevo entorno no es ni justo ni realista. Si su modelo de negocio se basaba en el control de las copias de las obras y en Internet no es posible sin vulnerar derechos fundamentales, deber√≠an buscar otro modelo.</li>
    <li><strong>Consideramos que las industrias culturales necesitan para sobrevivir alternativas modernas, eficaces, cre√≠bles y asequibles</strong>¬†y que se adecuen a los nuevos usos sociales, en lugar de limitaciones tan desproporcionadas como ineficaces para el fin que dicen perseguir.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet debe funcionar de forma libre y sin interferencias pol√≠ticas</strong>¬†auspiciadas por sectores que pretenden perpetuar obsoletos modelos de negocio e imposibilitar que el saber humano siga siendo libre.</li>
    <li><strong>Exigimos que el Gobierno garantice por ley la neutralidad de la Red en Espa√±a</strong>, ante cualquier presi√≥n que pueda producirse, como marco para el desarrollo de una econom√≠a sostenible y realista de cara al futuro.</li>

         	<p>I just discovered that it currently is not possible to comment on this blog. At first sight it looks like the problem is caused by the AJAX part that tries to publish the data to another domain.</p>

<p>However, it has been a while since I last touched the templates, and the commenting feature worked fine in January, when I received the last comment.</p>

<p>When I have time I will try to fix it or I will simply remove the fancy AJAX part. I&rsquo;ll keep you informed.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2009.03.16]</strong>¬†I have removed all AJAX stuff from the templates, so commenting should be possible again. I still have to remove some rough edges though.</p>

<p>I am back from the <a href="http://www.cebit.de/">CeBIT</a> show. Actually, I came back on Monday, but have been too busy to post. This year has been been a huge success for our company, mainly because we had a better place for our booth and because we presented right in the middle of this crisis a revolutionary low cost product on which we have been working for three years (sometimes you need a little bit of luck).</p>
<p>The show has been such a success that this year I haven't been able to visit the other halls of the show to see what is happening in the IT sector. Anyway, nowadays we don't depend on big trade shows anymore to inform us about the latest new products.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the most interesting parts for web site owners are the access statistics, and Google Analytics offers one of the most complete statistics solutions, which I use on a weekly basis for my most successful blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

<p>Besides being a typical blog with pages, I offer <a href="http://canasto.es/calendario-compacto/">calendars</a> for downloading, and of course I also want to track those downloads. When two years ago I started with the downloads I search Google&rsquo;s help files for a solution to track them, and found a small javascript sniplet that when a visitor clicks on a download link registers the download as a pageview. This trick allowed me to analyse the downloads.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this trick is that it inflates the pageviews, and I never have been completely satisfied about this solution. You can imagine my happiness when last week I discovered the <strong>Event Tracking</strong> feature, designed specifically to track downloads, videoplays, etc.</p>

<p>I quickly changed my code to use a javascript sniplet like the following:</p>

<pre>onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackEvent('Downloads',
'XLSX', '/calendario-compacto/calendario-compacto-2009'); "</pre>

<p>This sniplet registers the download under the category <em>Downloads</em>, the action <em>XLS</em> and the label <em>/calendario-compacto/calendario-compacto-2009</em>. Google Analytics has Event reports by category, action and level, so now I know for example which of the four file file formats are more popular:</p>

Image taken from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/absolutesubzero/luis-suarez-international-forum-on-enterprise-20">Luis Su√°rez</a></p>

<p>Last weekend I attended the <a href="http://eventoblog.com/">Evento Blog Espa√±a</a> conference in Seville, and one of the more attractive talks on the schedule was called 2.0 services and technology in business by <a href="http://www.elsua.net/">Luis Su√°rez</a>, technology evangelist at IBM.</p>

<p>Luis explained how he stopped using e-mail completely and replaced the functionality by a variety of web 2.0 tools, each specialized for a specific task. When he started talking, I remembered how Tim Ferriss also &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; e-mail in his book.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307353133">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, Tim explains how he only reads his e-mail a few times per day while an autoresponder tells the senders to use the phone instead for more urgent messages. I have read it several times, but I still can&rsquo;t see where the productivity increase comes from. I&rsquo;d rather check my e-mail twice a day to reduce phone calls. In my opinion, phone calls are a bigger time waster that e-mail. When someone phones you, that person decides for you that the issue he is phoning about is at that moment more important than all other issues you are working on. A phone call is almost always an interruption in your workflow, while e-mail is part of the workflow. Of course, there are times when a phone call is justified, for example when a customer is having technical problems that stopped his business. The idea is to use the right tool for the job, and in the past years I have spend quite some time explaining that the phone usually is not the right tool and that e-mail or IM for more time-dependant questions are more adequate.</p>

<p>Using the right tool for the job is exactly why Luis Su√°rez stopped using e-mail and changed it for instant messaging, wikis, blogs, rss, bookmark services, quickr, etc. In principle I agree with Luis that e-mail is not always the best tool to use, but at this moment there is a scattering problem when using web 2.0 tools. I already noticed this when I try to convince people to stop phoning me and use IM instead. There is a myriad of IM tools and protocols available, and to be able to communicate with all my customers I need ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Messenger, Skype and GTalk. <strong>All of them!</strong> I am a tech savvy guy, so I can handle this (all accounts are nicely accessible from one client: Digsby), but this surely is no option for many other people, who already find it very difficult to install one IM client.</p>

<p>Now imagine the same thing happening with all other functions of e-mail. To collaborate on a document there are dozens of services available. Of course I will choose one of them, but will me customer also use that? Of course not, they use Google Docs instead of a wiki. And as I cooperate with more people, my shared work will be shattered across the internet. I remember a customer send me a link to an interesting article, but where is it? I need to maintain a database to know that this particular customer uses Delicious to share bookmarks.</p>

<p>You can say a lot about e-mail. It is not the perfect tool for collaboration or status reporting. <strong>But it is a standard</strong>. Everybody has e-mail, and everybody knows how to use it. And if you work together with many customers, using web 2.0 solutions will not be an option in the majority of cases, until there will be a common protocol or tool such as Digsby for IM that allows people using different services for a functionality to cooperate.</p>

<p>Lately I notice more and more cards driving around in Lleida with the Apple logo, and each time I see one I think by myself ‚Äúwhy on earth would somebody stick that onto his car?‚Äù I also have that sticker at home, but it never occurred to me to stick it on my car.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple is a cool brand, is different and has a very nice logo. But whichever way I look at it, I see it as a profitable company, and sticking that logo on your car is free publicity for this company.</p>
<p>I guess it is the same people buying Bikkembergs shoes (if you remove the logo nothing is left) and certain Nike sportswear (a manufacturer logo on clothes should never be bigger than 2cm and preferably not visible at all) without asking any payment from the manufacturer in return.</p>
<p>In fact, the only logo I wear on my clothes is the logo of my employer, and only because they pay me to do so!</p>
<p>In my opinion, driving around with an Apple logo does not make you look cool, but rather stupid for making free publicity for a company.</p>

<p>Since I started writing on my Spanish productivity blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>, I had less time to write on Brain Tags. But it looks like it was worth any minute of my time, as today I received the good news that El Canasto has been <a href="http://www.adn.es/blog/premios-bitacoras/tecnologia/20081110/POS-0016-premios-bitacoras-2008.html">nominated for one of the Premios Bitacoras.com</a>, the Spanish Bloggies.</p>
<p>The past month, Spanish blog readers could vote for their favourite blogs in several categories. El Canasto quickly took the lead in the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong> category, and maintained the first position until the end of the voting period.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the jury will be announced, and they have until Friday to choose among the top three of each category, which means that I have about 33% chance of winning the price.</p>
<p>What makes me even more proud is that El Canasto ended at the 10th position on the list of most voted blogs, which in my opinion is really good for a blog in a not so mainstream niche.</p>
<p>The final winners will be announced this Saturday in Seville, and of course I am going to be there to see whether I won the price and to meet a lot of other bloggers. The winner will take a statue and a Toshiba NB100 home.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to let go some good habits to adapt yourself. When I came to live in Spain, I was used to drive all day with the lights of my car turned on for better visibility.</p>
<p>However, the people over here do not have that custom, and friendly as they are, they tried to warn me to tell that I forgot to turn off my lights. That is nice if it happens a few times, but actually it happened several times a day, and after a week I was getting quite fed-up with it. So I stopped driving with the lights turned on during daytime.</p>
<p>This week, the Spanish government started a campaign to tell people about the enhanced security when driving with the car lights turned on. Guess who is happily driving around with the lights on again?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.eventoblog.com/">EBE</a> is Europe's second largest blogging event (after Les Blogs in France) and will take place in November in Sevilla. And yes, on November 14 I will take the airplane to Sevilla to be present at this event.</p>
<p>When the event was first announced I doubted whether I should participate due to the high costs (plane ticket and accommodation; the EBE itself is free) and decided not to go.</p>
<p>What made me change my mind? Well, part of the program is the election of the best Spanish blogs, and my blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> makes a very good chance of being elected as the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong>! In the last partial rankings I held the first position, while previously I was number two.</p>
<p>Of course, the EBE is also a great place to meet some people in real life, people I have been working with for quite some time. I am also looking forward to meeting tons of new people, making new connections and new plans‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I am looking forward to participate at the Evento Blog Espa√±a.</p>

<p>Today is Blog Action Day, a day on which thousands of bloggers write about the same topic to raise awareness, and this year's theme is <strong>Poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="/2007/10/frugal-camping.php">last year</a>, I signed up to participate without thinking. But now that I start writing I realise that I am by far the right person for writing on this topic. Right now I am sitting in my own house behind my ‚Ç¨1400 Macbook with a high speed broadband internet connection. What am I supposed to know about poverty? I (and all my readers as well) probably belong to the richest 1% of the world.</p>
<p>For me poverty is something they show on TV. Only once in a while I see poor people begging for money on the street, and I know that I can ignore them because I happen to live in a country with excellent social services that will take care of these people. For my own conscience, I make my contributions to some NGO's to pay of my guilt debt. When I read back these lines, it sounds very cold, which is not how I am, but there is a great deal of truth in it.</p>
<p>Only twice in my life I actually saw poverty with my own eyes, when I visited Lesotho and Thailand, and it greatly affected me. More than that, it made me realise how lucky I am. We dedicate about 2% of our income to charity, which is an amount we won't even miss, but which makes a great difference for the people depending on it.</p>
<p>I encourage everybody reading this to do the same: realise how lucky and incredibly rich you are, and donate 1-2% of your income. Together we can stop poverty.</p>

<p>I just found a very interesting plugin for Movable Type: <a href="http://code.as-is.net/public/wiki/TagSupplementals_Plugin">TagSupplementals</a>.¬†As the name says, the plugin provides extra features for working with tags.</p>
<p>I am using the plugin on El Canasto to create a Related Entries list on each individual entry page. The related entries feature of this plugin has two weighing modes: <em>constant</em> gives each tag the same weight and simply sums up the number of tags the entries have in common, while <em>idf</em> gives each tag a weight of <code>1/freq</code>, where <code>freq</code> is the number of entries tagged with that tag.</p>
<p>Other features of the plugin, which I currently don't use, are: a tag count, related tags, a listing of all tags used in an archive, tag last update date, etc.</p>

<p>I have been using <a href="http://delicious.com/beltza">Delicious</a> for a long time, but lately I have started using Google Reader more and more, basically because I can share items without having to open the site.</p>
<p>But yesterday I found out that I can make my links in Delicious available in <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/projects/quicksilver.html">Quicksilver</a>, which means that I have a ton of information available with just a few keyboard clics. Instantly I am very interested in Delicious again, and surely will start bookmarking more sites again.</p>

         	<p>Today I launched the new design for Brain Tags. For a while I have been using the default theme provided by <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a>, but after updating the blogging engine to version 4.2 I decided to make some changes to make fully use of the new features offered by this version.</p>

<p>The theme I used is called <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/themes/mid-century.html">Mid-Century</a> and is a good example of the possibilities of the latest version of Movable Type Pro. To improve speed and stability, I used a static publishing model, while using cached modules for some of the sidebar widgets. That way I can easily update for example my Latest Comments widget without having to rebuild all individual archive files.</p>

<p>With this redesign I also stopped using Google Adsense, as the income generated was simply too low to justify its use.</p>

<p>In the coming days I will probably be making some little adjustments to adapt the new design to my tastes and needs.</p>

<p>For a long time <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">SmartFTP</a> was my favourite FTP application for Windows, and I have recommended it to many friends. However, SmartFTP suddenly has <a href="http://smartftp.com/purchase/free.php">changed their licensing structure</a> and is now obliging me to purchase a license. Of course, I immediately uninstalled the software and installed <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, which for sure is going to stay for free.</p>

<p>My macbook has been without backups for several months now, so I started looking for a backup solution. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> is out of the question, as I don't want to hook up a USB hard disk while I'm working (and when I don't work I don't want to leave my macbook switched on) and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">Time Capsule</a> is out of my budget.</p>
<p>On my PC I happily use <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/raf/signup.aspx?RAFUserUID=10773">Carbonite</a>, but they haven't released a version for mac yet. I have read some good things about <a href="http://mozy.com/home">Mozy</a> though, so I decided to give it a try. I signed up for the MozyHome Free account to test the service, installed the software and selected some backup sets to start with. A few hours later the initial backup was ready (I only selected 250Mb).</p>
<p>Happy with the results, I changed user to do the same, but Mozy could not find any files because it was still looking for files in <code>/home/Jeroen</code>. This very much surprised me, as I was used to Carbonite running as a service and being able to backup files from all users. I assumed that Mozy would not work the same, but that I could configure the files to backup on a per user basis. I couldn't find how to do so... I checked the FAQs on the Mozy site, but most of the texts have been written for Windows users.</p>
<p>And today I received an e-mail from Mozy explaining me how to get started with Mozy‚Ä¶ on Windows.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to do with the software. The initial backup went fine, but it is a real bummer that the backup is limited to only one user.</p>

         	<p>That is the question I have been asking myself a lot this year. In the past I always had a clear answer to this question, but lately I struggle with the aim of this site, which is why it has been very silent over here.</p>

<p>The first incarnation of Brain Tags was simply to inform my friends abroad about what was going on in my life, which was a very novel idea back in 1997.
The second incarnation of Brain Tags in 2001 still had the same aim, but intense due to my emigration to Spain.</p>

<p>After some years the content started shifting to include web design and other technology topics. I got settled in Spain, and my daily life was not so interesting anymore‚Ä¶</p>

<p>And now that blogging has become very mainstream (my wifes mobile phone comes with a blogging client installed!) and there are a thousand blogs writing essentially the same, I wonder what the place of Brain Tags is.</p>

<p>For a while I thought about closing Brain Tags, but then I decided that I do have a very clear and sometimes unique opinion about many subjects. So I do want to continue writing here, but probably in a different format. I think that shorter articles with some original thinking (less copying/forwarding stuff from others) will be the way to go. I will also incorporate some other things such as <a href="http://twitter.com/JeroenSangers">Twitter</a> steams etc. in the blog design.</p>

<p>Be prepared for changes, Brain Tags is alive!</p>

<p>I love Twitter to follow what people are doing, and what they are thinking, but in most cases I am not interested in every blog post. And if I am, I simply add their blog to my feedreader. It is OK with me if you point out some of your excellent blog post in Twitter, but, please don't make it automatic. In my opinion, TwitterFeed only adds noise to Twitter.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are also on Twitter, my ID is <a href="http://twitter.com/Jeroensangers">JeroenSangers</a>. I am also on <a href="http://friendfeed.com/jeroensangers">FriendFeed</a>, with he same ID.</p>

<blockquote>So, in Notes 8.5 you will see an Inbox that's easier to scan, with 10 improved icons for mail message types. The biggest changes are removing the icon for read mail and using a blue star for unread mail. We also adjusted meeting workflow items so that the most time-dependent ones (e.g., new invitation, reschedules, cancellations) stand out and those that are not so time-dependant (e.g., an invitee has accepted your meeting) are subtler. No other changes were made to the icon grid.</blockquote>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am multi-lingual: born Dutch, living in Spain and speaking English for most part of the working day.</p>
<p>In the past it was easy to choose the language to use: Dutch, unless the other person doesn't speak Dutch, in which case I spoke English. I also choose English as my preferred language for everything related with IT, as more software and documentation is available in English, and because of the horrible translations in the first Dutch operating systems.</p>
<p>When I moved to Spain, I only knew a little bit of Spanish, so I decided to dive into it, and convert my whole life to Spanish. I wrote my own personal notes in Spanish, my PCs had the Spanish version of Windows, my to-do lists and calendar were in Spanish, and little by little my Spanish improved.</p>
<p>Now that I have lived here for a little bit more than six years, doing everything in Spanish started to feel a little bit forced. A few months back I changed the language of my mobile phone to English, and suddenly I realized that it is indeed possible to fit the texts on the tiny screen. My phone instantly became easier to use.</p>
<p>Then I got a new laptop. Though initially and by habit installed in Spanish, I felt more at home when I changed it into English (fortunately, in Mac OS X the operating system language is a user preference, so I didn't need to reinstall). And since the tools I worked with are in English, I also enter the data (to-do items, appointments, etc.) in English.</p>
<p>For each aspect of my life, I choose whether it is best to do in Dutch, English or Spanish. For example, whenever I am writing on El Canasto, I prefer that everything is in Spanish in order not to lose any time translating. Therefore, my brainstorming, saved text fragments and Movable Type are in Spanish. I also found that even though I am fully trilingual, you can't beat 37 years of experience in a language. Deeper thinking and difficult tasks are thus easier to do in Dutch.</p>
<p>You see: each language has its place.</p>

         	<p>First there where blogs, then came the e-books and now there are <strong>Interactive Learning Environments</strong> (ILE). Building an ILE is a novel way of sharing your knowledge. For the last two months I have been following the <a href="http://teachingsells.com/?ref=ebdbbfb9&amp;pid=c4a0577c"><strong>Teaching Sells</strong></a>¬†course, and I am very enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p>The course is divided into five parts: Instructional design, marketing, creating multi-media content, business models and building membership sites. The more technical parts are not that interesting for me (just some links to the software used is enough for me), but the other three courses are well worth the money. Furthermore, the forums already brought some very good contacts, and I might be setting up some joint-ventures to start building membership sites.</p>

<p>My first ILE project will probably be a Spanish productivity course (what else?), on which I will start working in a few months (of course I am already doing some brainstorming now‚Ä¶)</p>

         	<p>Let&rsquo;s continue our trip through the history of Brain Tags at 1998, my second year of blogging.</p>

<p>I celebrated my birthday party in <a href="http://www.jnharmelen.nl/">De Jeugdhof</a>, and after cleaning the floor we forgot to close the fire hose. The next morning when we came back to finish cleaning we encountered a swimming pool instead of our cleaned floor. <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/1998/03/pittig-feestje/">Oops</a>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I also went to Africa and visited the very interesting country of Lesotho. Of course, still being a rookie blogger I only <a href="/1998/09/kaderschouw/">slightly mentioned</a> this instead of writing a post with high Google juice. Missed change indeed.</p>

<p>I also had the worst skin problems I remember and had to stay home for several days because <a href="/1998/10/ontsteking/">my face was severely infected</a>. I still don&rsquo;t know what caused it (<a href="http://braintags.com/archives/1998/05/">allergy</a>?, stress?), but fortunately it didn&rsquo;t return after 1998.</p>

<p>Then there were of course some stories about Jong Nederland, such as <a href="/1998/09/kaderschouw/">kaderschouw</a>, the <a href="/1998/11/nacht-van-16/">Night of 16+</a>, planning the <a href="/1998/12/brainstormen-en-volleybal/">EuroContact</a> and the famous <a href="/1998/12/brainstormen-en-volleybal/">volleyball tournament</a> of the Utrecht district.</p>

<p>It is good habit to add a personal note when inviting someone to connect through <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sangers">LinkedIn</a> to explain how you know the other person and why you want to connect. However, lately I noticed a small inconvenience with this approach:</p>
<p>I invited a few people with a personalised note and instead of the acceptation of the invitation I received a reply to my note.</p>
<p>It is no big problem, as I simply reply back and ask them to accept my invitation. Maybe LinkedIn could think of a 'Reply & Accept' button?</p>

         	<p>As I have been <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/11/10-years-of-blogging/">blogging for 10 years</a> now, I thought it would be a nice idea to look back at almost 1000 posts on my sites. Today an overview of the year it all started: 1997.</p>

<p>Though I already had a personal web page for some years, I didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time on it. My main interests these days were <a href="http://www.jongnederland.nl/">Jong Nederland</a> and <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a>. In November I had a great weekend with all JN volunteers on a national level, and in December I joined a Fimcap meeting in Rome. Though the meeting was only a weekend, I spend the entire week in Italy.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/1997/11/nieuws/">November 9, 1997</a> I added a new section to my personal web site: a news page. The word <em>weblog</em> did not exist yet, but my news page (though updated manually in FrontPage) did have some aspects of modern day weblogs; it showed the entries in reverse chronological order, but did not allow for comments.</p>
<p>The first entries are written in Dutch, but as I got more foreign friends I changed my personal site to English. The old news however, always stayed in Dutch‚Ä¶</p>
<p>A lot have changed in those ten years. Not only in my life, but also the weblog. It went through several designs, three domains, two content management tools, and had both active periods and inactive periods.</p>
<p>As I had very few readers in the beginning (I still remember the day I had 10 visitors) I doubt there is anybody who have been following Brain Tags since those early days. It doesn't matter whether you read this blog recently or for a long time, I wouldn't have continued that long without my readers. So I would like to use the opportunity to thank you all!</p>
<p>The coming days I will look back in more detail on the pas ten years.</p>

         	<p>Two years ago, reflections were cool and something new. Reflections gave your web site or your application a crisp look.</p>

<p>Nowadays, even the big operating systems and television stations have reflections and thus reflections as a design element are outdated. I am surprised, even irritated, by the big number of startups still using reflections in their logo or their screendumps only to look &lsquo;cool&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Get over it. Reflections are soooo 2005.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I could simply write here that I am too busy to write on Brain Tags, but I guess it is more interesting for you to read what I am doing currently. So this is a short list of my most interesting current projects:</p>

<h2>New web site for <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a></h2>

<p>This is a project on which I have been working for a long time (not always as active as now) and which should have been finished a long time ago. I am now finishing off the new design, after which we can finally show the world the work we have been doing. Working on a graphical design is quite an adventure for a technical person like me. I can easily tell whether I like a design or not, but to make one yourself is a whole different thing.</p>

<h2>Renewed site for <a href="http://www.brytenet.com/">Brytenet</a></h2>

<p>Hopping along with the Fimcap redesign, I am also reworking the site where I station my side-business. Both sites are built on eZ Publish, so I use the experiences on ons site to advance on another. I am also working to leverage some of the karma I got with blogging to new profitable projects under the Brytenet umbrella. You will read more about that when these plans have crystallized a little bit more. Anyway, currently the Brytenet site is off-line while I restructure the content, but before next week I hope to be open for business again.</p>

<h2>A home project</h2>

<p>There is still one room in our house where we didn&rsquo;t do anything since we moved in, the room where our visitors sleep. Those who have visited us can confirm that the beds in that room have had their time. So we are going to use our holiday in November to get rid of the current furniture and paint the room. In the mean time we are already looking for two new beds and a wardrobe to provide our guests with better rest and ourselves with more storage room.</p>

<h2>Teaching sells</h2>

<p>And finally I started an on-line course about making on-line courses (?) called <a href="http://teachingsells.com/?ref=ebdbbfb9&amp;pid=c4a0577c">Teaching Sells</a>, which will probably help me getting all that information I have been absorbing over the past years out of my head and into my wallet. I am sure some very interesting new projects will arise from that course.</p>

<h2>Blogging</h2>

<p>The blogs are still there, and will stay, though I am considering stopping to write on the <a href="http://pos-wizard.com/">Wizard of POS</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: This post is my contribution to <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a>, joining thousands of other bloggers to write about one topic for a single day. This year's topic is the environment.</em></p>
<p>Camping is my favourite holiday activity. In our tent I feel free and I feel at home as I use my own stuff and sleep in my own sack. Furthermore, it is very easy for a shy person like me to have contact with others on a camping. I feel a lot more comfortable on a camping than in hotel and apartments.</p>
<p>However, lately I noticed a trend of people camping more and more luxury: huge caravans with satellite television, microwave ovens, washing machine, skottelbraai, and even a motor to move around on the camping. While I like some comfort, one of the things I like about camping is its simpleness: less things around you means less cleaning and less worrying and thus more relaxing. And it still is possible:</p>
<p>When I still lived in the Netherlands, I was a member of the <a href="http://kampeerclub.nl/">NTKC</a>, a club of people who love camping in a simple and quiet way. The NTKC owns 22 campings in natural areas, and all the maintenance and administration is done by club members. On the NTKC terrains, people camp with tents up to 1.90 meters high and always in natural colours. When staying for a longer period, members move their tent to prevent dead grass.</p>
<p>Most of the time there is plenty of room on the campings; in spring and autumn it might happen that you won't see anybody else from your tent!</p>
<p>For me, being in the middle of nature is a very relaxing experience. If you live in the Netherlands and enjoy camping and nature, be sure to check out the NTKC. There are similar organisations elsewhere, such as the <a href="http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/">Camping and Caravanning&nbsp; Club</a> in the U.K..</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/09/24/why-teenagers-dont.html">Why teenagers don&#39;t buy iPods</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/09/24/why-teenagers-dont.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-09-24 11:08:00 &#43;0200">Sep 24, 2007</time></a>

         	<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/4b480cd39d.png" width="171" height="240" alt="iPod" /></p>

<p>When I take my breakfast in the mornings, I usually sit in front of a window looking out to the entrance of a school. Some days ago I looked at some teenagers and noticed that all of them were listening to a MP3 player, but none of them had an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPod-Nano-Video-Silver%2Fdp%2FB000JO7PIM&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">iPod</a>.</p>
<p>As the iPod is certainly the hippest and easiest to use MP3 player on the market, I assumed that at least some teenagers would have one, while others would settle for a cheaper model. The iPods is indeed more expensive than other players, but usually pricing is not that big problem for teenagers if the device is cool enough.</p>
<p>I decided to ask a teacher who also owns an iPod about his view on the subject, and he gave me a very simple explanation.</p>
<p><strong>The iPod is anti-social</strong>.</p>
<p>For teenagers, gadgets only have one function: communicating and sharing with friends. The first thing they do after downloading a song from internet is share it with their¬†friends. And well, the iPod simply won't let them do that.</p>
<p>Songs on the iPod are locked up and are only accessible from iTunes on the original PC. Furthermore, to connect an iPod to a PC you need a cable and there is no way a teenagers is going to walk around with an un-sexy USB cable.</p>
<p>A for teenagers successful MP3 player has an incorporated USB port (usually hidden under a cap) so they can connect it easily to any PC (at school, at their friend's home,...) and it should simply work like a memory stick with the MP3 files accessible from the operating system for easy copying of files.</p>
<p>As you know, I am not a very social person, and therefore I am perfectly happy without an iPod.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When I started using the default templates coming with Movable Type 4, I missed the <strong>Recent Comments</strong> widget. Below I explain how you can add create this widget and ass it to your sidebar in true MT4 style.</p>

<p>In the Movable Type administrative interface, go to Design &gt; Templates &gt; Template Modules and open either the ‚ÄòSidebar - 2 Column Layout‚Äô or the ‚ÄòSidebar - 3 Column Layout‚Äô template module, depending on which one you are using. Scroll down until you find a line with `` and paste the following code just above that line (you can of course also choose another position for the recent comments widget):</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-archives widget&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&ldquo;widget-header&rdquo;&gt;Recent Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-content&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&ldquo;widget-list&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;li class=&ldquo;widget-list-item&rdquo;&gt;&lt;a href=&ldquo;#comment-&lt;br /&gt;&ldquo;&gt; on &lt;a&lt;br /&gt;href=&ldquo;&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

         	<p>Widgets are the fastest and easiest way to configure your sidebar. Just open up the widget administrator and drag and drop widgets on the sidebar. A great feature for novice bloggers, who don&rsquo;t have the technical knowledge to tweak sidebar templates.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the default Movable Type templates don&rsquo;t use widgets, which means that to enable widgets on your site you will have to tweak the sidebar template‚Ä¶ ouch!</p>

<p>I know, the default sidebar template offers a far more advanced features than the widget engine can offer, with variables and MTIf constructions. The default sidebar template is a lot cooler without widgets, but also very hard to tweak.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the default sidebar template should include a check on the number of widgets configured. If no widgets have been configured, it should show the fancy sidebar, but as soon as I configure widgets, it should hide the normal sidebar and show the widgets. This is also what many templates in WordPress do and gives you the both of two sides: a fancy sidebar for starters which is easily adaptable by weblog owners.</p>

<p>Spain is a country of bureaucracy and civil servants. Many people I speak to have only one dream: becoming a civil servant. Unlike most other modern countries, in Spain civil servants earn way more that people working in companies. Add to that some very good secondary labour conditions and a <strong>contract for life</strong> without performance objectives, and you can understand why most people working for companies envy those others.</p>
<p>Just an example: most teachers earn about 25% more than I do (and my wage is higher than the average company worker). For that money, they work 18‚Äì22 hours a week at the school, plus some hours at home for preparation and revision of exams, while I work 8,5 hours a day, five days a week. Furthermore, while I have four weeks of holidays, they get two whole months in summer, two weeks at christmas and another week at eastern!</p>
<p>Other civil servants might not have such a long holidays as the teachers, but they do enjoy other benefits. Knowing all this, I am still surprised whenever I see the huge economical growth Spain is making with such a big and inefficient civil overhead.</p>

         	<p>The past days two posts have been published on other blogs, based on my experience and knowledge available on <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

<p>Last Saturday, I wrote an entry on <a href="http://www.whatsthenextaction.com/">What&rsquo;s The Next Action</a> called <a href="http://www.whatsthenextaction.com/archive/2007/09/01/online_gtd_with_nozbe_and_goog/whats_the_next_action">On-line GTD with Nozbe and Google Calendar</a>, in which I explain how two on-line services can be used together as a complete productivity tool.</p>

<p>And yesterday my second guest post (which I wrote some weeks ago) was published on <a href="http://gtd.marvelz.com/">GTD Experiences</a>. The post is called <a href="http://gtd.marvelz.com/blog/2007/09/04/getting-gtd-done/">Getting GTD Done</a>, and gives nine tips that in my experience help when implementing the <strong>GTD</strong> method. This last post is also available in Spanish on <a href="http://canasto.es/2007/09/getting-gtd-done/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

<p>Now it is time again to write on my own blogs&hellip;</p>

<p>Behind the screens, various big changes are happening on my blogging environment. As you see in the sidebar, I currently <del>maintain</del> have four weblogs.</p>
<p>The oldest of the four is <a href="http://braintags.com/">Brain Tags</a>, running since ages on Movable Type. Then I have a weblog called <b>The Wizard of POS</b>, until today running on the same MT installation as Brain Tags and available at ‚Äòpos.braintags.com‚Äô. There is also an old blog about my web hosting adventures, which I haven't updated in ages, called <a href="http://brytenet.com/weblog">Brytenet weblog</a> and just as the rest of the Brytenet site managed with eZ Publish. And finally I have my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> maganed with WordPress.</p>
<p>Quite a mess, isn't it? Add to that the fact that I have been experimenting a lot with non-public weblogs, and you'll get an idea of what things look like.</p>
<p>So I decided to clean things up, and do it well. You'll notice from the links in the side bar that I have presented my blogs as <strong>The Brain Network</strong>, a name I never have been satisfied with. Anyway, I acquired a new short and flashy domain name (of course hosted by <a href="http://brytenet.com/">Brytenet</a>) and made a fresh MT4 installation. This will be the home of <strong>Brain Tags</strong>, <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, <strong>El Canasto</strong> and a new network blog (I still have to decide whether I want to continue with the Brytenet Weblog).</p>
<p>Until now I have re-created <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, imported all existing entries, comments and trackbacks, and tweaked the default template. And by the way, I gave it its own domain name, <a href="http://pos-wizard.com/">pos-wizard.com</a>.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done (and I have little time), but I already feel good about the new <em>home</em> for my weblogs and am looking forward to being able to manage all my blogs from a single screen.</p>

         	<p>Lately, especially since I use Twitter, I receive a lot of URLs in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> format. That made me think: if TinyURL gives out a unique URL each time it is used, when will they run out of URLs?</p>

<p>On their site they state that they have more than 42 million of them, which doesn&rsquo;t sound like an awful lot. All TinyURLs I receive have a six character identifier, such as <strong>3bso2z</strong>. A little calculation (six positions with 36 options per position) gives me 2.238.976.116 unique identifiers. More than two billion, that sounds already better. And if they run out of Ids, they can simply use seven or eight characters, which I still consider tiny. Eight positions give 2.984.555.162.628 (2 trillion!) unique identifiers!</p>

<p>It is clear: TinyURL is here to stay.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Now that <strong>Movable Type 4</strong> has been released and leaped ahead of <strong>WordPress</strong>, the old discussion of static publishing versus dynamic publishing shows up again. Movable Type by default uses static publishing (it generates static HTML files with are served to the visitor) while WordPress uses dynamic publishing (all content is served directly from the database). What method is better?</p>

<p>As usual, the answer is: it depends‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Static publishing requires less server resources per visit, but it takes longer before updates (entries, comments and template changes) are visible. With dynamical publishing, your changes are immediately visible to your visitors, but you&rsquo;ll need more power to serve those pages.</p>

<p><strong>For most bloggers it won&rsquo;t make any difference</strong>, as they hardly tweak their templates and receive few comments and visitors. However, if you like tweaking your templates, you might want to go dynamic, and popular blogs are better off going static.</p>

<p>But wait, I can hear you think: <em>there are some very popular blogs using WordPress‚Ä¶</em> That&rsquo;s right, and without exception they use some kind of caching method to lower the server stress. On the other side, Movable Type can also run in dynamic mode (which is what I use for this blog), and you can specify for each template whether it should be served statically or dynamically, allowing you to optimize your site&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: for low-traffic sites, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you publish static or dynamic. If you have many visitors you probable want to use static or hybrid publishing.</p>

<p>I just remembered that a little more than a year ago I took off my watch. The main reason was that my skin was irritated by the leather in the hot weather. And I knew that I didn't really need a watch, as I spend most of my days behind the PC with a little clock in the corner, and usually wear both my mobile phone and my Palm with me.</p>
<p>Now, after more than one year without wearing a watch, I don't miss it at all. Not only because I have clocks in other places, but most of all as time is not that important. While wearing a watch I found myself checking the time several times a day, while actually I only have four moments on the day on which I really need to know the time: the moment I have to wake up (taken care of by the alarm clock), the moment I leave the office for my lunch break (I will notice as my colleagues will leave too), the moment I go back to my office after lunch (which is after the weather forecast on TV finished) and the moment to go home after work (once again, I only have to follow my colleagues). For none of these moments I need a watch.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more useless watches appear. In fact, nowadays they only serve as a fashion accessory or in case you are out without a mobile phone. The watch has become a relic from the past.</p>

<p>I believe him, when he tells that this technique has reduced his e-mail load significantly. But what he doesn&rsquo;t tell is what happened to the number of telephone conversations he received. In my case, I notice a clear increase in telephone calls when I am very busy and cannot answer e-mails within the usual 12 hours. And guess what, when I am very busy, the last thing I am waiting for are telephone calls! When somebody phones me, that person decides what I will be doing for the next two minutes and when I will give attention to him (now!), while with e-mail I am the one deciding who should get my attention and when.</p>

<p>Tim&rsquo;s trick only works because his workload is very low. When you&rsquo;re workload is higher and you need to spend more time in the zone, it makes more sense to change your voice mail message to tell people that you can only be reached by phone during one hour a day and that they get faster response when they send their inquiry by e-mail.</p>

If you&rsquo;re like me, reading and commenting on many sites, it can be difficult to track the replies to your comments. coComment captures your comment and tracks the conversations started by those comments on a single page instead of having to revisit all sites you&rsquo;ve commented on.</p>

<p>Yesterday coComment released a new version, bringing more <em>social</em> features. By doing that, they threw out the real value of their service: tracking conversations. The new page reserves 75% of screen real estate for groups, friends, favourites and neighbours, leaving just enough space for <strong>only five conversations</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/326eac8bb1.png" width="450" height="270" alt="coComment" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, all my conversations have been marked as unread, and I could not find an option to mark them all as read. This is not an upgrade, this is a downgrade!</p>

         	<p>For quite some time, my old domain <a href="http://jeroensangers.com/">jeroensangers.com</a> had been in <em>monkey mode</em>. That is to say, there was nothing interesting at all, except for a photo of me in my younger days.</p>

<p>For a long time I wanted to put up something more useful, but never started.</p>

<p>And you know how it goes: the moment you start, you can&rsquo;t finish anymore, and within a small period of time my new site was finished. I installed <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla!</a>, chose one of the default themes, removed a whole bunch of clutter and wrote a few simple texts. And there it is, <a href="http://jeroensangers.com/">my new personal hub</a>, where you can read all about me:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Whenever I had an idea for a blog post, I used to create a new entry on that particular blog, jot down my idea, and save the post as a draft. As soon as I had more time, I checked the list with draft posts, chose a draft, and finished the post.</p>

<p>What had worked perfectly for a long time, lately became a burden. The problem is that over the time I have collected a great number of interesting themes to write about, resulting in a big amount of drafts. Some of those drafts only contain an URL, while other are more elaborated. In short, it became too difficult to find out quickly what was what.</p>

<p>So now I have changed my blogging workflow. I transferred all my ideas to <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">Google Notebook</a>, where they are nicely ordered per blog. On that page I can see all ideas with their actual content at a single page. One glance on my Notebook, and I can quickly decide what to write. Furthermore, with the Google Notebook Firefox extension I am able to select a text on a random web page and copy it together with the address of the page to my Notebook.</p>

<p>From now on, drafts in my blogging software are actually pieces I already have started to write, which usually are only a few. This set-up keeps things clear, and speeds up my blogging workflow.</p>

<p>After a bad start, our holiday was great! We spend one week in St-George&rsquo;s-de-Didonne (tasting oysters and great wines at the beach) and one week in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port (hiking in the mountains and eating some of the best tapas).</p>

<p>One of the first things I did after coming back was fixing this site by upgrading Movable Type to the latest beta release. Of course I know that I shouldn&rsquo;t have upgrated the software just before leaving for vacation, but I took the bet and lost‚Ä¶</p>

         	<p>Next week we&rsquo;ll be going camping in France. That means amongst others that we will be making quite some kilometres, and if you know me a little bit you know that I am not that fond of travelling large hours.</p>

<p>One way to make the trip more pleasant is music.</p>

<p>The traditional source of music was the radio, but when travelling long distances in several countries, you&rsquo;ll loose your station every two hours. The past years we brought some CDs with us, but CDs are bulky and we can only take a few of them.</p>

<p>For this year&rsquo;s trip, I bought a <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=257270#">Belkin TuneBase FM</a>, allowing us to listen to all the music stored on MJ&rsquo;s iPod.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/50c54197d6.png" width="172" height="250" alt="Belkin TuneBase FM" /></p>

<p>The TuneBase converts the iPod into a radio station. It has four button to select pre-stored frequencies and up and down buttons for manually selecting frequencies. All we have to do is tune our car radio to the TuneBase frequency, and we can listen to all the music stored on the iPod.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re ready for the trip!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/06/19/movable-type.html">Movable Type 4</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/06/19/movable-type.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-06-19 11:05:00 &#43;0200">Jun 19, 2007</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last week <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> released the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">beta for Movable Type version 4</a>. Until last weekend I didn&rsquo;t have the time to have a look at it, but Sunday I downloaded the files and copied them to my server.</p>

<p>Of course things went wrong, as was to be expected with a beta release. I know that you never should install beta releases on a production environment, but I took the risk anyway as this weblog is partly a playing ground. I am a long-time Movable Type user, and suspect that my database is full of legacy data of old settings and plugins.</p>

<p>After copying the files, I went to the new MT Dashboard, and found out that all images had been scrambled. I suspected that my FTP application accidentally had uploaded them in ASCII mode, so copied them again in binary mode, without result. I checked the files I had downloaded from Six Apart, and yes, they were scrambled as well. So I downloaded the <em>tar.gz</em> file instead of the <em>zip</em>, uploaded the images again, and the images came up correctly.</p>

<p>The second problem I encountered was more serious. The dashboard showed up OK, but whenever I tried to access one of the blogs, I got an error message:</p>

<p><code>invalid permissions for author 1 at lib/MT/Author.pm line 337</code></p>

<p>This one took a little bit more to solve, but at the end I found out that newly created users don&rsquo;t have this problem. After comparing all settings in the database between my old users and the new user, I found the culprit: In the table &lsquo;mt_permission&rsquo; I found duplicate record for my user ID with <code>permision_blog_id = 0</code>. After removing the duplicate records, the error did not appear any more.</p>

<p>Now I am able to get into my blogs, and as you see, write new items. However, as soon as I publish a new entry I get another error message: <code>Fallback Is Required At Lib/mt/util.pm Line 1331</code>. I haven&rsquo;t solved this error yet, but found out that I can simply rebuild my site to make the entry appear.</p>

<p>As you can see, I also changed the design of the site. I was getting fed up with the previous design, and at the same time wanted to see what new template features came with MT4, so I reset the templates to the new minimalist theme. The coming days I will be studying and tweaking this design to my own tastes, so things might change a little bit.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed already is that the default templates do not use the widget manager, basically because the new sidebar template module offers filtering by template type, giving the possibility to show a different sidebar on different types of pages.</p>

<p>Other things they copied from WordPress are Pages and a file manager (with tagging!!!).</p>

<p>There are still some other things to be fixed, such as activating trackbacks. In the blog&rsquo;s configuration I see that this has been deactivated on a system level, which is not the case. So far I like MT4 a lot. It is fast, pleasant looking and I am happy with new features such as the file manager, entry auto-save and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/2007/06/making_template_errors_not_suck.html">interactive template errors</a>.</p>

She told him, "tomorrow morning I expect to find a gift in the driveway that goes from 0 to 200 in under 6 seconds, AND IT BETTER BE THERE."
The next morning, Mark got up really early before work. When his wife woke up a couple of hours later, she looked out the window, and sure enough, there was a small gift-wrapped box sitting in the middle of the driveway.
Confused, the wife put on her robe, ran out to the driveway, and took the box into the house. She opened it, and found a brand new bathroom scale.
Mark is not yet well enough to have visitors ...

         	<p>In order for a weblog to be successful, an author needs to write with personality. A weblog needs its own <strong>voice</strong>. And I have to be honest and admit that Brain Tags was missing a voice lately. I did post regulary, but most of the content was picked elsewhere and republished here.</p>

<p>But the voice is back! Of course I will still occasionally post a nice video, but will also start writing again about technology, travelling and my life in general. As a true <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr> adept, I added this commitment to my list of responsibilities (20.000 feet), and started thinking about some projects to undertake to blow new life in this site.</p>

<p>In November I will celebrate the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of my weblog, and will plan some extra activities here for all people who have followed me throughout the years.
Stay tuned!</p>

<p>I just signed up at <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, mainly to see what all the Ôøº<em>buzz</em> is about. As with many new tools, I will simply try it our for a few days, and then decide whether it brings me enough value to keep on using it.</p>
<p>Of course, with social products as Twitter, the main factor is the number of links/contacts/friends/whatever I can connect to. At this moment I am very lonely, so I would like to invite readers with a twitter account to link to me.</p>

<p>The release op <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a> is definitely the news of the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pipes is a hosted service that lets you remix feeds and create new data mashups in a visual programming environment. The name of the service pays tribute to Unix pipes, which let programmers do astonishingly clever things by making it easy to chain simple utilities together on the command line.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course I have tried out Pipes, and used it to create <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/6LNmLF_32xGc5sHKXqIxGw/">a consolidated feed of all my writings</a>.</p>
<p>Until now, I have two remarks about this service:</p>
<ol>
<li>I tried to sort my writings by publication date. It did sort them, but did not recognise the date format used in some feeds, starting with the weekday (Mon ‚Äì Sun). Therefore, my writings made on Wednesdays ended up at the end of the list;</li>
<li>As there still are relatively few Pipes, it is easy to game the listing, which is sorted by the number of times a Pipe has been run. I simply clicked a few time on the <em>Run this Pipe</em> link, and little by little moved upwards in the list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Two minutes more clicking, and my <em>Brain Network</em> pipe ended up halfway on the second page, in front of some way more interesting feeds. Help me get to the front page by <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/6LNmLF_32xGc5sHKXqIxGw/">running my Pipe</a>!</p>

         	<p>If you buy a brand new PC with Windows Vista, you might find a big surprise when Vista does not look the same as the Vista in the showroom. After installing Vista, the so-called <em>Windows Experience Index</em>¬†is calculated for your PC. Depending of the results of this test, certain features of Vista are enabled or disabled to give you the optimal performance.</p>

<p>This is great from a technical point of view, but makes it difficult to know exactly what you are buying. Only at home you will find your Experience index and see what has been disabled. And until now I haven&rsquo;t seen any hardware manufacturer publish the Windows Experience Index for the PC&rsquo;s they sell.</p>

         	<p>I am on the road again. Today I am traveling from Barcelona to Cyprus, spending over ten hours in airplanes and airports. No distractions, just me, so I could get a lot of job done. I carry a laptop computer, and already wrote some documents, I checked my e-mail and read all interesting news in Google Reader. I am in the ‚Äòflow‚Äô, but will soon have to stop working. My laptop is running out of batteries, and I still have about half the trip to go. I searched in every corner of the airport, but haven&rsquo;t found a single power outlet!</p>

<p>Many travellers nowadays carry laptop computers and other electronic devices, and most of those devices need electricity. Batteries only serve for some hours, so power outlets in airports would be useful to many travellers. I can&rsquo;t imagine the number of productive hours lost each year in Milano alone! Please airports, give us power outlets.</p>

         	<p>A little bit more than one month ago, <a href="/2006/12/a-new-weblog/">I started a new weblog</a> called &lsquo;<a href="https://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>&rsquo; in which I write about <em>Getting Things Done</em> and personal productivity.</p>

<p>Until now I have written 28 posts meaning that I have been able to keep up with my initial schedule of at least one post every two days. I found it easy to find new material, and usually have about 10 posts in he pipeline.</p>

<p>The people have received the new blog very well. I have received 30 comments/trackbacks. Quite some bloggers have found my blog and have reposted or linked to my articles. The most popular post is <a href="https://canasto.es/2006/12/calendario-compacto/">my translation</a> of <a href="http://davidseah.com/archives/2006/12/14/compact-calendar-for-2007/">David Seah&rsquo;s compact calendar</a> for 2007 with 2850 unique views. At this moment I am receiving about 200-400 visitors per day.</p>

<p>So far it has been a very positive experience for me. Even though it costs me a little bit more time to write in Spanish, I enjoy using this language and already learned some more. Of course I tell my visitors that I am not a native speaker, and hope they are willing to forgive my errors.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I published the first entry on a new weblog: <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

<p>El Canasto is my first blog in Spanish and has been created for two reasons. The first reason is that I have found very little material in Spanish about <em>lifehacks</em> and <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a>, one of the topics I like to read about. There is clearly something missing in the Spanish weblog spectrum. The second reason is that I really want to improve my Spanish language skills, but don&rsquo;t have the discipline to sit down and study. However, writing about stuff I like might give me the drive to learn more.</p>

<p>To set up El Canasto I used WordPress and the minimalistic <a href="http://cutline.tubetorial.com/">Cutline</a> theme. I spent some days making sure every word in the template has been translated correctly into Spanish, and have many plans more for optimizing the look &amp; feel of this new site. But for the moment, it is more important to get rolling, so I published a first little entry. My plan is to maintain a higher posting frequency than on this blog or the <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">Wizard of POS</a> as I have much material and a lot of ideas for this blog.</p>

<p>For now I would like all my readers to have a look at <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/11/24/two-faces-of.html">Two faces of the Pareto Principle in business</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/11/24/two-faces-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-11-24 12:50:00 &#43;0200">Nov 24, 2006</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<blockquote>The <strong>Pareto principle</strong> (also known as the 80-20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity) states that for many phenomena, 80% of the consequences stem from 20% of the causes.
<em>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Wikipedia</a></em>

</blockquote>

<p>The Pareto principle was named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of income in Italy was received by 20% of the Italian population, but the same principle can be found in many other situations.</p>

<p>In most businesses, 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales. And technical departments know that 80% of the problems are caused by only 20% of the clients. This is very interesting information for managers, who can use these numbers to steer their sales and support departments.</p>

<p>But how can we correlate the Pareto numbers for these two departments? Are the 20% that purchase the most the same customers that use most of your organization&rsquo;s resources? Well, experience tells us that this is not the case: there usually are customers buying for huge amounts without ever needing the support department. The two Pareto principle are not correlated, so if we only look at the small group of customers responsible for 80% of the sales, you will find once again that 20% of that group is using 80% of the resources.</p>

<p>As there is no correlation, I can easily divide my customers into four distinct groups:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>
    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales and using 80% of the resources;</li>
    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>
    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales and using 80% of the resources.</li>
</ol>

<p>I put those four groups in a specific order. The first group is worth the most, as they bring in a lot of money at low costs and the fourth group is the most difficult group.</p>

<p>So should you just drop the customers in the fourth group? Of course not, as we are talking about a principle and not a fixed categorization. If you drop group four, and look again at the numbers, you will see that once again 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales and 80% of the resources are used by only 20% of the clients. Customers who were in to top 20% before, not rank lower simple because you have less customers. If I have 100 clients, there are 20 clients in the top 20%, but if I drop 50 of them, the top 20% will be formed by only 10 customers. Of course, if you have to drop customers, because you haven&rsquo;t got enough resources, make sure you drop clients from the fourth group, as the clients in the other three groups are worth more.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/11/15/google-reader-glitches.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-11-15 11:57:00 &#43;0200">Nov 15, 2006</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A while ago I tried out the new <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, and haven&rsquo;t looked back at my old <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/2005/12/rss-bandit/">RSSBandit</a> ever after. It ran very smoothly since the start, and I just love the &lsquo;River of News&rsquo; view.</p>

<p>But lately the experience has decreased. The last few days Google News feels slow, taking about 2-3 seconds to go from one article to the next one when I press the <em>J</em> key, which was also noticed by <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/13/too-fast-for-google-reader/">Robert Scoble</a>.</p>

<p>I also noticed that sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t load all my unread items as it did before; after reading about fifty articles, I reach the bottom, while there are still many unread items waiting for me to be read. This is not a big issue, as I can simply press the <em>R</em> to refresh.
The last days I noticed another glitch: <em>zombie articles</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/5ecd75266e.png" width="566" height="180" alt="Google reader telling me that there are no unread items, while there are 2 new articles" /></p>

<p>Google Reader tells me &lsquo;Your reading list has no unread items&rsquo;, while at the same time it shows that I have two unread articles from <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">tech.memeorandum</a>. For me, this is the most irritating glitch, as I have to leave my <em>River of News</em> to open the specific feed, change my setting to show all articles and go down the list to find the zombie.</p>

<p>Google Reader still is my preferred reader, and I hope they will solve these glitches soon.</p>

         	<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/65c4093238.png" width="299" height="246" alt="Network" /></p>

<p>More and more bloggers unite in so-called blogging networks. Robert Scoble published a good overview of the most important networks in <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/">Competitors of PodTech that I love, er, going to the Content Mall</a>. A content mall is the same as a blogging network.</p>
<p>As I am interested in blogging in general, I have been following various blogging networks for some time. I can clearly see the benefits of blogging networks for the bloggers involved, but have been wondering for a long time what the benefit is for the visitors of a site part of a blogging network. So I posted the following <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164130">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is clear that 'content malls' bring in huge benefits for the sites within a mall. They can work together and link to each other to boost PR.</p>
<p>But what benefit is there for the visitors? Shopping malls bring benefit by sharing a physical space with various stores. After going shopping for clothes I can buy some electronics without having to drive to another place. Very comfortable.</p>
<p>But when visiting a fashion weblog part of a content mall I can go to the technology weblog of that mall just as fast as I can go to any other techblog. I won't visit the technology weblog because it belongs to a certain group, but rather because I like it in spite of being part of that group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164224">Answered</a> promptly by Robert self:</p>
<blockquote><p>By joining a network a blogger/podcaster/videoblogger will probably be able to get paid much more than if he/she tries to do it on his/her own.</p>
<p>That money might let them quit their jobs (that's what happened to <a href="http://GeekBrief.TV">GeekBrief.TV</a>, for instance) which will enable that person to produce even more content for you. Or, maybe, afford better equipment. Or, maybe be able to afford a trip to more industry conferences where they'll be able to bring you more news and information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert completely hits the nail on its head here. What is good for the blogger is good for his/her reader.</p>

         	<p>Sometime, thing that have been in place for many years get in the way. In such cases, it is better to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Today, I said goodbye to the <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/2004/09/music-jukebox/">music jukebox</a> the place where for the past two years you could find tasty music. In this age of streaming music and video, there is no need any more to share MP3 files. Sites like <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> and <a href="http://pandora.com">pandora</a> are of greater help for discovering new music you like.</p>

<p>I also removed the <a href="http://jeroensangers.com">jeroensangers.com</a> site. Until now, that page showed an ugly photo of me (is it even possible to have a pretty photo at all?) and some links to my various sites. I am going to rethink the purpose of that site, which will probably contain more dynamic content. Until then, the site is in <em>stealth mode</em>.</p>

<p>Now, that feels a lot better!</p>

         	<p>Just like most other weblogs, this site has its ups and downs, and you might have noticed that it has been <em>down</em> lately. I am quite busy at the moment, working parallel at several projects.</p>

<p>The company I work for is preparing for the <a href="http://www.ifema.es/ferias/simo/default_i.html">SIMO</a> trade show in Madrid, where we will present the new versions of our products. Though I won&rsquo;t be present at the show (my responsibilities lie outside Spain) I do have a lot of extra work concerning translating and testing the new software.</p>

<p>Then I am working on the new <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a> web site. This weekend we are going to finish the forum functionality and start working on the design. We already did some brainstorming and I am happy that we are all more or less on the same line. Once the design is finished we will start using the first parts of the new site, and gradually transfer more functionality.</p>

<p>Once in a while I also work a little bit on <a href="http://brytenet.com/">BryteNet hosting</a>. Little by little the customers are coming in, but as everything is running smoothly and automated, I don&rsquo;t have much work on it.</p>

<p>And finally there is the blogging thing. I am planning on taking it more seriously, using Brain Tags for playing around, and doing the real blogging at <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">The Wizard of POS</a>. I am rethinking my work flow to crank up the posting frequency &ndash;now once a week&ndash; and have a more diverse range of articles. Furthermore I am working on a new weblog in Spanish about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=braintags-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F8495787164%2F"><abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>You see, I have plenty of work, so I better stop writing and get something done!</p>

<p>The campaign for the upcoming Catalan parliament elections officially started last Sunday. Main opposition party <a href="http://ciu.cat/">CIU</a> started in a very American way by including a one hour DVD called <strong>ConfidencialCAT</strong> criticizing the current government with any Catalan newspaper.<br>
I was shocked.</p>
<p>Not because of the movie, which I haven't seen yet, as in the past three years CIU has done nothing else than criticizing and whining. No, I was shocked because all newspapers co-operated. Every single newspaper in this country got blinded by flash of sensationalism and opted to distribute plain propaganda. Last Sunday, the newspapers of Catalonia lost their independence and transformed themselves into propaganda vehicles.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Everybody who knows me a little bit will admit it: I am a lazy person. Because I am so lazy I work in the IT industry, dreaming about automating all those boring tasks. Of course, automating tasks is hard work, but I don&rsquo;t want to think about that.</p>

<p>One of the problems I wanted to automate for a very long time is making backups of my PC. I know that it is very important to backup my files, and usually after tweaking my backup system I backup every X days. But after a while I loose interest, and days become weeks, and weeks become months,‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Media choice is another problem with backups, as the amount of data I have is growing exponentially. Back in the MS-DOS days, all important data fitted on e few floppy disks. As I started my studies and got involved in <a href="http://jnharmelen.nl/">Jong Nederland</a> I produced more documents and changed to ZIP disks for my backup. When I started ripping MP3 files, I was forced to change to CD&rsquo;s and DVD&rsquo;s. And now that I am creating my own video&rsquo;s I need even more than that. I thought about buying a USB hard disk, but the thought of spending a lot of money for a medium that will be outdated within two years kept me from going to the store.</p>

<p>And then I found <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/raf/signup.aspx?RAFUserUID=10773">Carbonite Online Backup</a>. Carbonite is a little application that will <strong>automatically</strong> backup my files to a server on the internet, without any user interaction. The best part of Carbonite is its price: $5 per month for <strong>unlimited</strong> storage!!! So for only $5 per month I can sit back and relax, knowing that my files are safe, and I won&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of space in the future.</p>

<p>I quickly downloaded and installed the demo version (15 days free), which promptly began to upload data. Now there was a little problem, as our broadband connection is ADSL, and the A stands for Asynchronous meaning that you can download at high speeds, but have less bandwidth available for uploading. It took me two days to get all my files to the Carbonite server.</p>

<p>When checking what files were present on the Carbonite server, I noticed that there was a lot of crap. In the installation procedure, I had selected that I wanted to backup <em>My Documents</em> and the <em>Desktop</em>, which Carbonite had interpreted as being the whole <em>Documents and settings</em> folder, including cached files, etc. I tweaked the settings a little bit, and was able to reduce the backed up volume by one third. I also added some other files such as my ActiveWords database and my Trillian preferences (both installed under <em>Program Files</em>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got the whole system up and running for some weeks now, and am very happy with it. My backups are always up-to-date and I don&rsquo;t have to think about copying files anymore.</p>

<p>The only problem I have found is my mailbox. As I typically have e-mail open during the whole day, the inbox file changes continuously. Besides that, the file is rather big, taking a while to upload. The result is that this particular file is hardly ever backed up. I am still looking for a solution, possibly using another tool to create a local copy and adding this copy to Carbonite.</p>

<p>In short: Carbonite is a very good product giving great value for its money.</p>

         	<p>For me the holiday period is not only a period for relaxing, but also a period of reflection. I never make any <em>January 1st</em> changes to my habits, but usually do so in August or September.</p>

<p>For a while I have been thinking about doing more sports, as most days my physical exercise is limited to the daily walk to the garage to pick up the car. We do occasionally walk in the mountains, but that&rsquo;s not enough. I have been thinking about it for a long time but never found the activity that suited me. My working hours make it difficult to commit to team sports and I don&rsquo;t like the gym as I prefer something in the open air.</p>

<p>This summer it finally occurred me: inline skating could me my thing. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed ice skating in the Netherlands, and like the freedom of making little tours around my hometown. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. Right after coming home I bought myself some <a href="http://www.rollerblade.com/">Rollerblades</a>, the Geo II model, and downloaded some braking instructions as I knew that I&rsquo;d had to learn different breaking techniques that I used on ice.</p>

<p>This week I went out skating two times on an empty parking lot. The coming weeks I will go back there to practice my breaking skills before I hit the streets. And you know what the best thing is? I already feel good about myself!</p>

         	<p>This weblog will remain quiet for some weeks as I will be on <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/2006/08/holiday-plans-1/">holidays</a>. If you have any question, remark or news, just drop me an e-mail. I will occasionally read my mail, but probably won&rsquo;t respond until the end of this month.

         	<p>Though weblogs are the perfect example of <strong>periodical publications</strong>, in many countries they are not liable for <abbr title="International Standard Serial Number">ISSN</abbr> codes. After the Spanish standards organisation denied an ISSN request, a group of bloggers created the <strong>IBSN</strong>, the <em>Internet Blog Serial Number</em>.</p>

<p>In a short time an <a href="http://ibsn.wiki.mailxmail.com/PaginaInicial">IBSN wiki</a> was created and of course there is an <a href="http://ibsn.blogia.com/">IBSN weblog</a>. And finally a handy PHP scripter created a <a href="http://www.hewop.com/~ibsn/add.php">tool</a> to manage <a href="http://www.hewop.com/~ibsn/">all IBSN numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Since I support their cause and because you can never have enough buttons and banners on your weblog, I requested an &lsquo;official&rsquo; IBSN code for Brain Tags:</p>

         	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> launched a new affiliate tool this week called aStore. This tool allows you to create your own themed Amazon store and embed the store on your web site. The tool is very easy to use and allows you to create a site complete with product reviews and full product descriptions. They have even added some widgets that automatically display lists and similar items. There have always been ways to display lots of Amazon content on your web site, but this is a much more robust and easy to implement option.</p>
<p>Of course I could not resist playing around with it, so I created my own little store and filled it with products related to <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen</a>'s <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> productivity methodology: books, labelers, moleskine notebooks, PDA's‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I am planning to embed the aStore in my new GTD related weblog, but until that I will only publish an ungly Amazon aStore link to my <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/braintags-20">Getting Things Done</a> on-line shop.</p>

         	<p>One more week to go until the start of our holidays. Yes, we go when everybody else already forgot about their holidays.</p>

<p>Our plans are simple: we are going to spend one week in the Netherlands, and two weeks in Andalusia. We&rsquo;ve tried to visit my family before, but the flights were simply too expensive in the high season. So we decided to use part of our holidays to visit my family and our friends. As we have plenty of time, we will go up by car, saving a few bucks along the way.</p>

<p>After that we plan to spend some days at home to pick up our tent, and drive further down to Andalusia. In the almost five years that I live here, I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of Spain besides Catalonia. Of course there is plenty to see over here, but I feel a little bit ashamed of my lack of knowledge about the other parts of this country. The two weeks we will be spend in the south will be a little start in getting to know more of Spain.</p>

         	<p>I joined the <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense program</a> before I started using <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/">GMail</a>. As a result of this, I have to logins for Google&rsquo;s services: the old e-mail for AdSense and my Gmail account for using all other Google service.</p>

<p>I was fed-up with this situation, so I decided to look at the AdSense help pages for instruction on how to combine my two accounts. I found the following:</p>

<blockquote>Right now, it isn't possible for AdSense publishers to update their email address directly from within their account. If you require an update of the email address associated with your AdSense account, please follow the instructions below to help us assist you.

<ol>
    <li>
Draft a new email. If possible, please use the email address currently associated with your AdSense account
</li>
    <li>Write 'Login change request' as the subject of your message
</li>
    <li>
Please include all of the following in the body of your message:
</li>
    <li>The email address currently associated with your account

    <li>The email address you'd like to use as your new account email address
</li>

</li>
    <li>The number of page impressions registered on your first day of impressions
</li>
    <li>Send this email to adsense-support@google.com
</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>I collected all the necessary information, and requested a change to my Gmail account. This was their reply:</p>

<blockquote>Unfortunately, I'm not able to update your AdSense login to a Google Account or a Gmail address because our system doesn't support this type of change at the moment. I sincerely apologize for the trouble this causes you, and I thank you for bearing with us as we work hard to extend this option to AdSense publishers in the future.<br /><br />

I can, however, update your AdSense login to a non-Gmail address if you prefer. You can simply reply to this email, providing the desired email address in the body of your response, and I'll take care of your request as soon as I'm able.

</blockquote>

<p>WTF?! Google does not have the possibility to merge accounts???? If I sign up with Yahoo! I can use that e-mail account for AdWords, but I can&rsquo;t use a GMail account? Great way to send customers to the competition! They&rsquo;ve got some work to do then, since all those acquisitions they make will only bring more people like me with double accounts. It cannot be <em>that</em> hard, right?</p>

         	<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/9cd4783ad0.png" width="168" height="168" alt="Podcast" /></p>

<p>Yes, the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/podcast/">43 Folders podcast</a> is my favourite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" title="Wikipedia info about Podcast">podcast</a>. There are a few reasons why I consider it my favourite. Besides the obvious reasons such as &ldquo;Merlin Mann is a geek like me&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am obsessed with productivity tools&rdquo; there is another difference between the 43 Folders podcast and 99% of all the other podcasts out there.</p>

<p>Most people listen to podcasts during their daily commute. Modern society forces people to spend a ridiculous amount of time travelling, and there are very few things you can do while driving a car. Most commuters listen to music or the radio, but that is a very unproductive activity. If you want to spend your car-time productively, you only have two options: audio-based learning and listening to podcasts. Long commutes are the perfect place for listening podcast, and most podcasters target their show to this group. The result is that most podcasts are either 30 minutes long or 60 minutes long, so listeners have handy building blocks to fill their car time. 30 minutes also gives the podcasters the possibility to add decoration such as jingles and music to their show, making podcasting more entertaining, but less productive.</p>

<p>My commute usually takes less than 10 minutes, so it makes no sense for me to listen to podcasts in the car. I listen to podcasts during my breakfast instead. I only take a sandwich and a coffee for breakfast, so the maximum podcast length is about 15 minutes. I searched around (why do none of the podcast directories have an advanced search feature where I can filter for podcast length?) and found only very few short podcasts. And out of this very few podcasts that fit my needs, 43 folders is my favourite.</p>

         	<p>I am happy to say that I rarely receive spam. But today a message slipped though my defence lines using a tactic I did not see before: they sent me a simple, innocent message with a Word file attached.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/9f59670b64.png" width="491" height="151" alt="" /></p>

<p>Apparently the current generation of spam filters has gotten to the level where the only spam getting through are unreadable V1^Gr^ messages, and they are desperately looking for new ways to get their message across. Though probably many people that otherwise would read the e-mail won&rsquo;t open the Word document, the possibilities to create a readable message makes this a viable spam method. As far as I know, few spam filters look at the contents of attachments, but that is about to change.</p>

<p>At the moment the spammers are once again one step beyond the filters‚Ä¶</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<blockquote><strong>Personal finance</strong> is the application of the principles of finance to the monetary decisions of an individual or family unit.

</blockquote>

<p>I have a love/hate relationship with personal finance. Ever since I have a computer I have been trying to get a grip on finances, with changing results.</p>

<h2>The excel days</h2>

<p>My first attempt used the example Excel sheet created by the <abbr title="Nationaal Instituut voor Budgetvoorlichting">Nibud</abbr> that came with Microsoft Excel. It was a nice and clever Excel sheet, but still living with my parents I only used part of it. After a while I stopped entering my receipts, and out went the Excel sheet.</p>

<h2>Hacking in Access</h2>

<p>A little bit later I started playing with Microsoft Access. Access also comes with a financial example file, and I modified and tweaked it to fit my needs. But after all the hacking, all left to be done was entering receipts and numbers, which is a boring job. I guess I still didn&rsquo;t need personal finance, as I left the database alone after some months.</p>

<h2>Banking software</h2>

<p>Some time later, a new phenomenon showed up: internet banking. My bank sent me some diskettes with an application that was able to import bank statements. Now that was easy! At first I tried to manage cash money with that application as well, but soon left that again. Internet banking was a success, as I have managed my bank accounts through that application until I could access my accounts through web pages. When later I started buying and selling stocks and stock options I could do that from the same application. That little application gave an overview of my bank accounts, but I still haven&rsquo;t been able to see where the money was going‚Ä¶</p>

<h2>Back to basics</h2>

<p>The situation complicated when I started living together. I was not dealing with my money anymore, it was <em>our</em> money. After some months the question came up: &ldquo;Where does our money go?&rdquo; We talked about it, and decided to implement a low-tech financial planning solution: pen &amp; paper. This worked great for some months, until we had more or less a picture of our expenses. Exit pen &amp; paper.</p>

<h2>Excel round two</h2>

<p>Last year we were planning some big expenses, and I wanted to know whether these were justified, and how much time we would need to recover the invested money. Right about that time I read about an easy budgeting template in Excel, <a href="http://pearbudget.com/">Pear Budget</a>. I downloaded it, sat down half an hour to fix the categories and the budgets, and have used it ever after. It is easy and fast to maintain, gives a good overview of our spendings. However, lately I had the feeling that I wanted more. Pear Budget shows me where the money is coming from and where it is going, but does not show what we have, and what we are expecting to have in the future. Besides that I wanted to make some changes in the categories I had set up last year, and that would mess up all past numbers.</p>

<h2>The current solution</h2>

<p>So I started to look around for a more complete solution, that could offer me budgeting, but also import bank statements, manage investments, work in several currencies, schedule payments, ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I thought a moment about searching for a Web 2.0 solution, but quickly let go that idea as I wouldn&rsquo;t trust such a personal information to anybody. I looked at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx">Microsoft Money Premium</a>, but that seems a very US centred product, and is overly complex; I do not need my personal finance application to do tax statements.</p>

<p>After a little but more of searching, I found <a href="http://www.mechcad.net/products/acemoney/">AceMoney</a>, a cheap but very complete solution that seems to fit my current needs. The user interface is not as shiny as MS Money, but it certainly does the job. Furthermore, AceMoney has been translated into many languages and even loads the local list of banks and categories.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>As of version 3.31, <a href="http://sixapart.com/movabletype/">Movable Type</a> natively supports tags.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tags">Tags</a> are keywords or descriptive terms associated with an item as means of classification. Unlike categories, an item can have many tags to describe the item in several ways. Tags are well known from other (web) applications such as <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brainpics/">Flickr</a> for tagging photos and <a href="http://del.icio.us/beltza">del.icio.us</a> for tagging links.</p>

<p>The well known weblog search service <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> introduced tags to weblog entries, and allows for browsing and searching texts on weblogs by tag. Blog entries can be tagged easily by simply placing a few links at the bottom of the entry in <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">the right format</a>:
<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%5Btagname%5D" rel="tag">[tagname]</a></p>

<p>Now that <abbr title="Movable Type">MT</abbr> also supports tags, I hoped for a fluent integration with Technorati. Even though the default MT templates do not link the tags shown on the pages to Technorati but rather to an internal tags search on the current weblog, I hoped for a standard implementation in the RSS feed templates spidered by Technorati. And indeed I found a correct looking code:</p>

<p>Technorati automatically converts categories in the RSS feed to tags, and even though MT defines a new namespace, it should work correctly‚Ä¶ But unfortunately, the above code does not add the tag called &ldquo;technorati&rdquo; to the item, but rather the record number &ldquo;31&rdquo;.
When I tried to look up the specification at <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag">http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag</a>, I received a 404, so I still don&rsquo;t know whether Six Apart made a mistake when developing the new feed template or whether Technorati should have parsed the feed. Does anybody know whether either Six Apart of Technorati are working on this issue?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the biggest problems in scripting and programming is escaping quotes. Quotes have a special meaning, they are usually used for specifying the start and end of a string, such as in <code><code>&lt;abbr title=&quot;eXtensible Markup Language&quot;&gt;</code></code>. But what happens when the string between the quotes also contains quotes? ‚Ä¶Errors!</p>

<p>There are several ways to prevent this situation. The two most common solutions are escaping the quotes by placing a special symbol in front of it such as <code>\&rdquo;</code> and replacing the quote by its character entity reference <code>&quote;</code>.</p>

<p>Why am I telling this? Well, this morning I was looking at <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>&rsquo;s Favorites function, and noticed that something went wrong. When adding a site to your favorites, you have the posibility to attach tags to that site. The instructions for adding tags are clear:</p>

<blockquote>Separate tags with spaces: cooking indian recipes. To join words use double quotes: "san francisco".</blockquote>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t work that way! When I tried to add &ldquo;point of sale&rdquo; as a tag<br />
<img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/4af2c567c8.png" width="422" height="160" alt="Technorati tags" /></p>

<img src="https://jeroensangers.com/uploads/2021/88f51e0cd2.png" width="419" height="154" alt="Technorati tags" /></p>

<p>Technorati obviously tried to solve the quoting problem by replacing the quotes, but this change has a nasty side effect. Of course I have contacted Technorati about this issue, and will update this post when they reply.</p>

         	<p>Only a week after <a href="http://braintags.com/2006/07/the-end-of-brain-links/">I closed down Brain Links</a>, Brain Links is back, albeit in a more simpler form. Before, each link had its own page, with a description and the possibility to comment on the link (which was rarely used). The new Brain Links is only visible as a linkroll on the sidebar of the main page of Brain Tags.</p>

<p>To power Brain Links, I no longer use Movable Type, but created a new widget that fetches the last ten links from <a href="http://del.icio.us/beltza">my del.icio.us account</a>. There are no archives, no overview, no categories, no comments,‚Ä¶ just ten interesting links.</p>

<p>In case somebody also wants to create a del.ico.us widget, this is the code I used:</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class=&ldquo;module-delicious module&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&ldquo;module-header&rdquo;&gt;Brain Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&ldquo;module-content&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://del.icio.us/beltza&quot;&gt;my">http://del.icio.us/beltza&quot;&gt;my</a> del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>Insert the code above into a new system template called <strong>Widget: del.icio.us linkroll</strong>, and add the widget to a widget manager. Do not forget to replace <em>beltza</em> with the name of your del.icio.us account!</p>

         	<p>After reading the lifehacker <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/web-publishing/desktop-blog-editor-comparison-190652.php">desktop blog editor comparison</a> I decided to give <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing for Firefox</a> a try. I am a happy user of Ecto (number three in the comparison), but the performancing editor has WYSIWYG functionality, as well as Technorati and del.icio.us integration.</p>

<p>So I installed the plugin, and am now writing the first post in my new editor. So far I like it. It is easy to use, and it has more than enough functionality.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>When its latest stand-alone browser ships in Q4, Microsoft plans to use its patch-distribution mechanism as its primary delivery vehicle. But businesses will be able to control distribution via a Microsoft-provided blocking tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though a new version of the most popular web browser is definitely needed (the rendering engine is more than 6 years old, and there are many security problems) I wonder whether it is a good iedea to push it through the throat of so many people. This is going to lead to a lot of problems.</p>
<p>I am not afraid of websites that suddenly don&rsquo;t look so nice as before or that even stop working. The webmasters of such sites already had the chance to improve that ever since Firefox became popular, and if they still haven&rsquo;t updated their sites they will soon enough as visitors start complaining.</p>
<p>No, the main problem lies in the tight integration with the operating system, and the many third-party applications that make use of IE functionality. Though websites can be updated on a single place to fix the problem for once and ever, this is a lot harder for applications installed on millions of PC&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A few months ago we have found that some of our applications are incompattible with IE7, giving an ‚ÄòInvalid URL format‚Äô error. We quietly started looking for a solution for this problem, expecting that IE7 would be released together with Windows Vista or as an optional download. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/26/678149.aspx">announcement </a> that Microsoft is going to push IE7 as an automatic update surely is going to give us some problems, as we are going to have to solve this bug and update all our customers before the end of Q3!</p></p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After the succesful redesign of <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">The Wizard of POS</a>, I had gathered some momentum, and continued with the redesign of Brain Tags.</p>

<p>First of all, I reverted back to the basic Movable Type templates, as I had hacked the old templates to a level that made it very difficult to maintain and update. Actually, the latest update to version 3.31 broke my site at several parts.</p>

<p>When all templates were more or lass back to basic, I used the fantastic StyleCatcher plugin to change the look and feel. I selected a style called <a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/designs/make_my_way">Make my way</a> from the Movable Type style contest. I know it is not very original, as there mioght be dozens of other blogs using the same style, but it is far better than I ever could make.</p>

<p>This is where it stands now. I still have some minor issues to fix, which will probably be done next week. What do you think about the new Brain Tags?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Since June 2004 I have posted 953 links to interesting, new and funny sites in the Brain Links section of this site. Today I have decided that I will stop adding more links.</p>

<p>I noticed the last months that little by little I am adding less links, and I started to wonder why. I started collecting the Brain Links as a reference site for myself; a place where I could look up those handy sites I saw a month ago. But the reality is that nowadays I hardly look back at all those links. It has literally become a link dump, a black hole for interesting stuff. I guess that subconciously I already figured out that it is not worth the effort anymore.</p>

<p>So exit to Brain Links. Soon I will start remodelling the Brain Tags site, just as I have done with <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">The Wizard of POS</a>, which will probably result in a leaner site that is easier to maintain and update. At that point, the Brain Links will probably disappear completely, though I know that you should not break links..</p>

<p>It has been very quiet on this site, and that usually means that I am working on something. And indeed, I am working on the new site for <a href="http://fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a>.</p>

<p>Besides that, the temperature in Lleida, almost reaching 40 ¬∞, makes that I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time behind the PC, but rather stay in the water of the swimming pool. As you might be worried what is going on here, I deceided to write a little bit about the new fimcap site.</p>

<p>We decided to implement the new site using the eZ Publish CMS, which allows for multi-lingual content and custom defined content types. This flexibility of course has a price: a steep learning curve. The basics are quite simple, but problems start when you want to modify templates. You literally can control everything, but you have to find the right template. Each page is made up from dozens of little templates, each of which can reside in several places.</p>

<p>Let me explain that in more detail. If you do a fresh installation, your site is configured to use two sets of templates: <em>standard</em>, which contains some bare-bones unstyled templates that make sure eZ Publish outputs at least something, and <em>base</em>, which adds a little bit of style. Of course, for your own site you want to use your own design, and you can either replace the <em>base</em> design, or add your own design, which is what we did. Now every time a template is called, eZ Publish first looks in the Fimcap design. If it can&rsquo;t find a template, it will search in the <em>base</em> design, and finally it will fall back to the <em>standard</em> design. So if I want to modify a template, I have to search in that order as well to find the currently used template. After a working for some weeks with the template system, I finally got the hang of it, and am able to find the correct templates quickly‚Ä¶</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re interested in the progress we&rsquo;re making, have a look at <a href="http://new.fimcap.org/">new.fimcap.org</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After reading the lifehacker <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/how-i-work/">How I work</a> series, I thought that it might be interesting to write down my own way of working for the readers of Brain Tags.</p>
<h2>What desktop software do you use every day?</h2>
<p>As most people I have two sites from where I work: in the office I sell and support the products of <a href="http://www.ICG.es/">ICG software</a>, and at home I run <a href="http://brytenet.com/">BryteNet</a>, do some web development, blog and keep in contact with me friends all over the world. At both places I use a Windows XP desktop PC, equipped with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a></strong> I use the Internet a lot, and have always have some tabs open with sites I want to read whenever I have a spare moment, e.g. when I am on hold. With Internet Explorer I would have my task bar cluttered with screens, but Firefox's tabs keep things organized.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.activewords.com/">ActiveWords</a></strong> Whenever I have to work on a PC without ActiveWords I feel very clumsy. ActiveWords automatically corrects my typing errors, opens my applications, fills in texts and generally saves me a lot of time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a></strong> With customers and friends all over the world I use instant messaging all the time. The problem is that everybody uses another application, and the different applications (MSN, ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Google Chat,‚Ä¶) do not talk together. Instead of installing a separate client for each protocol, I use Trillian, which 'speaks' all those protocols.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://skype.com/">Skype</a></strong> Instead of sending messages, it is more efficient to actually talk to somebody. That is where Skype comes in, as I can talk with any other Skype user for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In the office:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> We are a Microsoft shop, so obviously use Outlook. Most of my colleagues use it exclusively for e-mail, but I spend more time in the calendar and tasks. Of course I had to make some adjustments, as the Microsoft way of doing things does not always coincide with my own. So I installed <a href="http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/">Outlook Quotefix</a> to stop Outlook from top-posting when I reply to messages and to trim the headers in my replies. Furthermore I use the <a href="http://gtdsupport.netcentrics.com/learn/">Getting Things Done add-in</a> to streamline my workflow and the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download&trk=ftr_ol">LinkedIn toolbar</a> to create contacts directly from people's signatures and to keep them updated when contacts change their <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sangers">LinkedIn profile</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/desktopsearch/enterprise/default.mspx">Windows Enterprise Desktop Search</a></strong> We have a lot of information scattered over a few places on several servers and of course on my own PC. Windows Desktop Search brings that all together, as I have it index all items in Outlook (mail, tasks, notes, contacts), and all documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML and PDF) on my PC and the servers. I use the enterprise edition as it has a much cleaner interface than the MSN edition.</li>
<li><strong>ICG Software</strong> Of course we have our own applications installed. Not only for giving support, but also for invoicing and tracking customer activity (CRM).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.unyte.net/">Unyte</a></strong> Unyte is a free add-on for Skype that allows you to share an application on your PC with the person(s) on Skype. I use it to give demonstrations, training and support to our foreign customers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>At home:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a></strong> My e-mail client of choice. It is fast and complete. Of course I use the IMAP protocol instead of POP3, so I always have all my important messages on the mail server to be accessed through webmail.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.palm.com/us/software/desktop/">Palm Desktop</a></strong> At home I don't need an advanced planner, so this simple (and free!) calendar, task list and contact list fulfills all my needs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a></strong> Blogging made easy. A real blogger does not write in small <code>textarea</code> fields, but uses a full blown desktop client.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/">HTML-Kit</a></strong> I used to do my coding work in notepad, but noticed that I needed some more features. Since then I use HTML-Kit to do all my coding.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS-Bandit</a></strong> To stay up-to-date with what is happening in the world I follow the writings on several web sites. Instead of visiting these sites every day, A read their feeds in RSS-Bandit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What web sites do you use every day?</h2>
<p>Just in terms of raw weekly hours, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is definitely number one. In addition to regular old searching, I use it for looking up definitions, as a calculator, and for checking stuff like maps and weather. I do love the Google.</p>
<p>Furthermore I use <a href="http://getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> to track my worked hours.</p>
<p>All other sites enter in RSS-Bandit, which is my dashboard to the world. It shows me tech news, news about my friends, search results on topics I am interested in, comments made on my weblogs, replies to comments I have left on other blogs‚Ä¶</p>
<h2>What PDA/personal organizer/system do you use to keep organized?</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/07/palmone_zire_31/">Palm Zire 31</a>, which I keep synchronized with my two workstations. I always have all information at hand, whereever I go.</p>

         	<p>FC Barcelona is champion of the <span xml:lang="es">‚ÄòLiga</span>‚Äô. If you know me only a little bit, you know that I couldn&rsquo;t care less, right? I only like sports the moment I practice it myself, but do not care about what others are doing. I like playing soccer with friends, though I am a terrible player, but get really bored when looking soccer on the television, to the point that I usually fall asleep.</p>

<p>But when FC Barcelona is involved, I have no choice. Living ‚Äòonly‚Äô 160 kilometers from Barcelona means that Bar√ßa is part of daily life. It is as simple as that, and there is no way around it! Each and every day they appear on the TV news, whether they are preparing for a big match or simply because the players went for a walk.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening hell broke loose in Lleida. After the match everybody went out on the streets to celebrate the victory. There were fireworks, drums, people shouting and singing, but most of all car horns. The streets in the center had collapsed of all the cars driving around like crazy with Bar√ßa flags out of the windows.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind what Bar√ßa does, but I always appreciate a good party!</p>

<p>When we were close to Andorra this weekend, we hopped over the border to do some shopping. We were looking for a new digital camera, and finally bought the Pentax A10. Of all cameras that matched our requirements, small form factor, minimal 3x optical zoom, quality optics system, the Pentax was the only one offering a usefull additional feature: stabilisation. The problem with small cameras is that it is very difficult to hold it steady, especially when using the zoom function. Stabilisation makes sure that pictures are still sharp under these conditions.</p>

<p>The coming days I will try out our new camera, so you might expect some changes on my photo page again.</p>
