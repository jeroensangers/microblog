<p>Some businesses offer money (or services or discounts) in exchange for those testimonials. That’s a little over the ethical edge for my taste.</p>

<p>But lately I have encountered service providers paying people for negative testimonials for their competitor”s services. How low can you go?…</p>

         	<p>Some intresting thoughts on <em>intelligence</em>:</p>

<p><blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Let's move on from 'Unintelligible Intelligences' - IQ, Multiple Intelligences, Emotional Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence..." data-author="Donal Clarc" cite="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2020/09/lets-move-on-from-unintelligible.html">
The brain is the organ that named itself and created all that we are discussing but it is a odd thing. It takes over 20 years of education before it is even remotely useful to an employer or society. To attribute ‘intelligence’ to he organ is to forge that, compared to machines, it can’t pay attention for long, forgets most of what you teach it, is sexist, racist, full of cognitive biases, sleeps 8 hours a day, can’t network, can’t upload, can’t download and, here’s the fatal objection -&nbsp;&nbsp;it dies. This should not be the gold standard for intelligence, as it is an idiosyncratic organ that evolved for circumstances other than those we find ourselves in.

         	<p>I just deleted <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a> from my phone. I have tried it for two weeks and have come to the conclusion that the platform in its current state does not provide any value to me.</p>

<p>The first week I tried using it as intended.</p>

<p>I betrayed the privacy of my contacts by uploading their information to the Clubhouse server and followed all of those who were already on the platform.</p>

<p>The first few days I listened in on a few rooms to understand how the platform works. Since about half of the rooms discuss about Clubhouse, this was easy enough. Then I went to the second stage, and once in a while, when I thought I had something useful to share I requested stage access. I even met a few new people.</p>

<p>After a week the constant stream of notifications started to bother me, so I dialled down the notification frequency to “Very infrequent“.</p>

<p>This week I also started thinking about why Clubhouse is such a success and why I don&rsquo;t feel it is a good fit for me.</p>

<p>First, the barrier to enter is very low. You&rsquo;re immediately welcomed by your friends, even if you didn&rsquo;t upload your contacts, since your friends already did. You can just enter and leave rooms until you find something interesting.</p>

<p>For me the biggest issue has been finding interesting rooms. It may be because of my contacts, but I found that in most rooms they talk either about what is Clubhouse, about online marketing or about both. Sometimes I found an interesting room in the “Upcoming” list, but always at an inconvenient time. Furthermore, you can add future rooms to you calendar, but I&rsquo;d rather simply receive a notification within the app when the room starts.</p>

<p>I have met some people who spend several hours a day in Clubhouse, but that is not how I want to use social networks. I want to connect at a time that is convenient for me, and have an interesting conversation at that very moment.
Ah, and I prefer conversations with a small group of people instead of big rooms of listeners.</p>

<p>As it is right now, Clubhouse is set up as a conference center, with a few people speaking on stage and many listeners. I would prefer to see a version set up as a bar, where I can join a small table where everyone participates.</p>

<p>Until then, goodbye Clubhouse.</p>

         	<p>The past two days I have been hanging around in <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a>.</p>

<p>So far I like it, though I would like to see a broader spectrum of conversation themes. So far, since the platform is full with online marketers, the main topics are &ldquo;What is Clubhouse?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can I use this platform for marketing my business?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think audio is the perfect medium for establishing conversations, since it&rsquo;s more personal and faster to produce than written text and it&rsquo;s easier to get professional quelity than video.</p>

<p>That said, Clubhouse is a closed environment. Surely, soon there will be Clubhouse clones in many forms, but I doubt any open platform will get enough traction to pass Clubhouse as the most popular option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to have a conversation with you on Clubhouse. You can find me as always as <a href="https://micro.blog/JeroenSangers">@JeroenSangers</a>.</p>

<p>We prefer not to buy an Intel computer on the verge of a new architecture launch so we postponed the buying decision to today. In the unlikely event that Apple announces a new iMac with  Silicon, we will purchase it right away. Otherwise, we won’t wait any longer and buy the current Intel-based model.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html">23 years of blogging</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2020/11/10/years-of-blogging.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-11-10 15:42:11 &#43;0100">Nov 10, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>23 years ago, I decided to add a page to my website where I explain what has been going on in my life. A few years later I learned that there was a name for such a page: a <strong>web log</strong>.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since then.</p>

<p>I have changed the blogging engine several times. The first page was made in Microsoft FrontPage, followed by hand-crafted Server Side Includes (SSI), the NewsPro CGI script and Movable Type, my favorite blogging engine of all times. Later, I decided that tweaking servers, databases and scripts was no longer a good use of my time, so I parked the blog on the hosted version of WordPress. And finally, this year I made the switch to Micro.blog.</p>

<p>Also the contents of the blogposts have changed in those years. Starting with a monthly post in Dutch summing up previous months activities in my life, I changed to writing in English when I migrated to Spain and wanted to keep an international group of friends up-to-date on my life here. When I got bored explaining my life I slowly shifted to a mixture of technology, humor, music and web standards. There also have been several years with hardly any new posts, as I focused on my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href="https://canasto.es">el Canasto</a>. As of last year, I am back to blogging again (mostly in English, but sometimes in Dutch or Spanish), (un)focused on a mixture of personal themes, interesting stuff I found on the web and some technology.</p>

<p>As for the future of this blog, seen my recent interest in publishing more (I even wish to publish daily), I think it is safe to say that the blog won’t go anywhere. Now that I have kept it alive for 23 years, I surely want to make sure to celebrate its 25th anniversary in two years.</p>

         	<p>Wise words from James Clear in his newsletter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Avoid calendar debt. Don’t spend (free) time you haven’t earned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A meeting is like a loan: it is time you haven&rsquo;t earned yet. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since sometimes the inversion is worth it. Just be aware of this fact whenever you make a time-commitment.</p>

More than ever before, we’re using technology to connect with the outside world. And with so many of us now working from home, we’re relying on our phones to stay updated with colleagues and clients. However, when you’re receiving endless Zoom calls and emails, pings on Slack, and notifications from everywhere else, it begins to hinder productivity and focus.

<ul>
<li>Microsoft FrontPage</li>
<li>NewsPro</li>
<li>Movable Type</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
</ul>

<p>Today marks the start of a new era, since I now officially joined the <a href="http://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> movement and migrated my 23-year old personal blog to <a href="http://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>.</p>

<p>The import went flawless, and it was easy to set-up.</p>

<p>My only gripe is that I am still waiting for HTTPS to be activated, since appears to be done manually by the staff.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t request HTTPS while I haven&rsquo;t changed my DNS setting. This means that I&rsquo;m having a little bit of downtime, since all visitors will get an error message while HTTPS is not activated.</p>

<p>For me it&rsquo;s no issue, since I don’t get many visitors anymore (this site peaked fourteen years ago).</p>

<p>One of the most expensive things a service business or freelancer can do is promise that work will be done by a certain day. Which is something we need to do, of course, but we should charge appropriately. “It’ll be done soon,” should be way cheaper than, “It’ll be done at exactly 11 am on Tuesday.”</p>
<p>And one of the most important things we can do to focus our energy and commitment is be prepared to promise a date certain. It sharpens everything.</p>

The purpose of a meeting is not to fill the allocated slot on the Google calendar invite. The purpose is to communicate an idea and the emotions that go with it, and to find out what’s missing via engaged conversation.

         	<p>This morning I was checking my data in the health app, when I noticed two new sections: Symptoms and Mobility.</p>

<p>Both could be useful, but as a walking enthusiast, the Mobility metrics caught my eye:</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/f46da5cb41.png" width="337" height="600" alt="iOS 14 Step length" /></p>

<p>Four of the new mobility types, <strong>Step Length</strong>, <strong>Walking Asymmetry</strong>, <strong>Walking Speed</strong>, and <strong>Double Support Time</strong> have a paragraph similar to the screenshot above.</p>

<p>That means that no external device is needed to collect this data, as long a I carry my iPhone in my pocket, which I always do.</p>

<p>One question remains though: How can I activate this function? I found no options in the settings. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait for the final release to find out…</p>

Influencers make us feel that productivity is important, and yet they rarely define the term, let alone helpfully. For example, David Allen’s Getting Things Done (GTD) book, which became very popular in software circles, uses the term productivity very loosely. Many of the core examples in the GTD method relate to general activities such as cleaning one’s garage as opposed to working with knowledge. And the GTD principles have no reference to cognitive science, even though cognitive science is the modern interdisciplinary science of understanding the information processing we do in our brains, with or without the aid of technology.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last week I started writing up my <strong>Personal Knowledge Management Workflow</strong> as part of that workflow.</p>

<p>You know, the best notes are about note taking, just like the most popular blogs are about blogging and the most popular YouTube videos are about creating YouTube videos.</p>

<p>Back to my notes.</p>

<p>When describing the concept of <strong>garbage in = garbage out</strong> I realised that it had been ages since I pruned the RSS feeds I consult each day during breakfast.</p>

<p>So I left my notes to take a deep dive into my <a href="http://inoreader.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inoreader</a> account. This turned out to be a multi-hour project, so I chunked the task as any productive human would do.</p>

<p>Then, when checking <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> between two chunks, I ran into a post called <a href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/feed-reading-by-social-distance/">Feed Reading By Social Distance</a> by Ton Zijlstra. I loved the idea!</p>

<p>Until now I have always organised my feeds by <em>interestingness</em>, using numbered folders:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Quality control:</strong> my own publications which I always want to check first.</li>
    <li><strong>Interesting:</strong> my favourite blogs which I want to read whenever I can.</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk:</strong> the rest of the posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Triage: </strong>new subscriptions that I want to try out before moving them to ‘Bulk’.</li>
    <li><strong>Whenever I have the time</strong>: some high volume feeds that I usually skipped.</li>
</ol>

<p>After reading Tom&rsquo;s post, I first renamed all my feeds with the author name. As Tom said: feeds express a personal relation.</p>

<p>I unsubscribed from most business and group blogs, with a few exceptions for some blogs run by two or three people I know well.</p>

<p>Then I dedicated several hours to reorganise the 242 remaining feeds into social distance based folders:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>My Publications</strong>: this folder actually has number 0, but in HTML it is complicated to create numbered lists not starting at 1 and being strictly sequential.</li>
    <li><strong>Close Contacts</strong>: People I know well and with whom I have a relation spanning several years.</li>
    <li><strong>Dunbar's Tribe</strong>: feeds from people I know in real life, through digital exchanges or by having followed them for over a decade (as long as they also publish some personal information).</li>
    <li><strong>Outer circle</strong>: interesting writing by people I don't know at all.</li>
    <li><strong>The Fire Hose</strong>: some feeds by businesses. I assigned number 99 to this folder to indicate the correct social distance.</li>
</ol>

<p>While reviewing all those feeds I also made sure they are all configured to use the ‘https’ protocol, that they use the current domain name (some blogs moved from using the platform&rsquo;s subdomain to having their own domain) and to use a current feed address.</p>

<p>Speaking of the latter, it surprised me to see that several blogs, including some high volume sites, still channel their feeds through <a href="https://feedburner.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedburner</a>.</p>

<p>So there we are, all feeds organised and read. Not the only thing I can do to procrastinate a bit more is write about it on my blog…</p>

Even when researchers compared lonely people with purpose to social butterflies without it, purpose came out on top. In other words, it’s possible when we’re doing things to better our society, the body assumes there’s a society there to better. We’re technically alone, but it doesn’t feel that way.

How about if we replace mission statements with <em>invitation statements</em> instead? Invitations are much more agreeable. Invite people to participate in your vision to create a better future, but don’t push your vision on the whole world because people will fight you on that. If you force your mission onto people without consent, so much of your otherwise creative energy will be wasted on defending yourselves eventually, and you’ll deserve that kind of response.

Modern educational institutions care a lot about content: what theories we teach, what ideas students are exposed to, what skills they come away knowing. But we rarely address the more general question of how one transforms their mind into a tool well-honed for elite-level cognitive work.

I say all this to suggest that, perhaps, email is not “broken” but the way we are using it is. Perhaps there is a solution that could make things better for you that doesn’t involve a new app or service.

         	<p>Far too many people are unaware of the real consequences of giving up their privacy. As Carissa Véliz writes, privacy is not a private problem, privacy is a collective issue.</p>

<p><blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Privacy is a collective concern" data-author="Carissa Véliz" cite="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/privacy/2019/10/privacy-collective-concern">
Because we are intertwined in ways that make us vulnerable to each other, we are responsible for each other’s privacy. I might, for instance, be extremely careful with my phone number and physical address. But if you have me as a contact in your mobile phone and then give access to companies to that phone, my privacy will be at risk regardless of the precautions I have taken.

<p><blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Living according to your hierarchy of values" data-author="Derek Sivers" cite="https://sive.rs/vls1">
Once you realize that one value is more important to you than another, you have to ask yourself if you’re living accordingly.</p>

<p>What’s ultimately more important to you?
<ul>
    <li>Learning? Or creating?</li>
    <li>Money? Or time?</li>
    <li>Expanding? Or focusing?</li>
    <li>(… etc.)</li>
</ul>
Once you know which takes top place, consider taking it to an extreme, to its logical conclusion, and optimizing your entire life around that top priority, letting go of almost everything else.

  When we told our guide that we didn't want to go to all the tourist places he took us instead to the places where they take tourists who say that they don't want to go to tourist places. These places are, of course, full of tourists. Which is not to say that we weren't tourists every bit as much as the others, but it does highlight the irony that everything you go to see is changed by the very action of going to see it, which is the sort of problem which physicists have been wrestling with for most of this century.

<p>I am no scientific in any way, but still remember the importance of the above statement from my chemistry classes. As an example, when you want to test the pH of a liquid using a piece of litmus paper, you have to make sure that the amount of liquid is large enough to eliminate the effects of the pH change inducted by the piece of litmus paper. In other words, using litmus paper to test the pH degree of a drop of liquid has a huge error margin.</p>

<p>I have this principle in mind with most things I measure. The inclusion of a piece of JavaScript on the pages of my web site in order to have Google Analytics collect data about my visitors has an effect on the user experience: the page loads a little bit slower. However, Google&rsquo;s infrastructure is fast enough so that the increase in load time is hardly noticeable.</p>

<h2>URL shorteners</h2>

<p>Many Twitter users also want to measure the efficiency and popularity of their tweets. The most common method of doing this is by using an intermediate server, the &lsquo;URL shortener&rsquo;, which registers each visit to the destination site.</p>

<p>In the first years of Twitter, URL shorteners such as <a href="http://bitly.com">bit.ly</a> were necessary to prevent long URLs from using too many of the available 140 characters in a tweet. However, in 2011Twitter implemented their <strong>own URL shortener</strong> inside their service so that each URL, including the ones passed through another shortener, only use 20 characters. Therefore, URL shorteners are no longer necessary to actual shorten url&rsquo;s, though I meet many Twitter users who believe it still is needed to prevent links from using too many characters.</p>

<p>Another false believe about URL shorteners is that it&rsquo;s the only method to get metrics about the popularity of each tweet. Once again, this was true in the past, but nowadays Twitter gives <strong>excellent statistics</strong> about the number of favourites, retweets and answers to each tweet on their <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com">statistics page</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between Twitter&rsquo;s own shortener and external services is <strong>transparency</strong>. When you see a tweet with a link in it, it will show (the beginning of) the URL of the shortening service in case of external shorteners and the URL of the actual page you&rsquo;re linking to if you don&rsquo;t use an external shortener &ndash; and therefore just Twitter&rsquo;s service. See the two test tweets further below in this article for the actual differences.</p>

<p>On a side note, using a URL shortener is adding an additional <strong>Single Point of Failure</strong> as each visitor clicking a link inside your tweet has to make two hops: first he visits Twitter to obtain the shortened URL, then he visits the site of the URL shortener&rsquo;s service in order to get the actual address of the page you&rsquo;re linking to and finally he visits the actual site. Without a shortener, the middle step is skipped.</p>

<p>Since tweets are so short and give little context, I assumed that the actual link people see in tweets makes a lot of difference when deciding to click or not. My <em>expectation</em> was that tweets with shortened links get <strong>clicked less</strong> than tweets showing the original link. To confirm this hypothesis, I decided to craft an experiment.</p>

<h2>Experimenting</h2>

<p>For conducting the test, I selected a page with a nice viral title that I published a few years ago. I use Google Analytics on my site to measure traffic and labelled the link with campaign parameters, so I could separate the visitors clicking the links in the tweets from the regular visitors: <code>?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=NoShortener&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TestShortener</code></p>

<p>I prepared two versions of my tweet: one with the link shortened by <a href="http://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a> and another one linking directly to the article.</p>

<p>I decided that I had to publish the tweets multiple times over the course of a week in order to maximise exposure and got a significant number of clicks. For that purpose I used the <a href="http://tweko.com">Tweko</a> service, which was invoked by adding the <code>#tweko</code> hashtag to the tweet. Previously I had configured Tweko for the two twitter accounts used in this test to repeat each tweet nine times with a ten hour interval betuneen each tweet.</p>

<p>Of course, the likelihood of receiving clicks decreases each time the tweet is published, as many followers will already have seen the tweet before. I decided to give the expected underdog in this experiment &ndash; the tweet with the shortened URL &ndash; a small advantage by starting the publishing schedule with the shortened version of the tweet.</p>

<h3>Tweet 1 -- Shortener:</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es">Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href="http://t.co/2iZFFblXsn">http://bit.ly/1c8gCuw</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/371931328067153920">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>

<h3>Tweet 2 -- No Shortener:</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es"><p>Cómo ganar 2 horas productivas al día en un instante&#010;<a href="http://t.co/ekVvviOOni">http://canasto.es/2010/03/como-g...</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweko&amp;src=hash">#tweko</a></p>&mdash; Jeroen Sangers (@JeroenSangers) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeroenSangers/statuses/372006931189481472">agosto 26, 2013</a></blockquote>

<h2>The results</h2>

<p><p>After a few weeks I decided to have a look at the statistics in Google Analytics. I went to the report that shows the visits per campaign, and clicked on the campaign named &lsquo;TestShortener&rsquo; to focus only on the visits originating from my test. Then I configured the field &lsquo;ad content&rsquo; as the secondary dimension of the report, to get the numbers for each of the two versions. These are the results I found:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Ad content</th>
      <th>Visits</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shortener</td>
      <td>382</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NoShortener</td>
      <td>438</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>820</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>

<p>Clearly, the tweets that did not use a URL shortener received more visits that the shortened version, but is this a significant difference? Is it possible that this difference is caused by random fluctuations? In statistics, this question is usually answered by running the <strong>Chi-squared</strong> test. This test gives a confidence level, which is the percent of the time each sample&rsquo;s success rate will fall within the reported confidence interval if the experiment is repeated many times. It is also the percent of the time no difference will be detected between the two groups, assuming no difference exists.</p>

<p>In order to calculate the confidence level, I need two numbers for each sample: the number of successes and the total number of trials. I already have the number of successes, the number of visits I received on my page shown in the table above. The total number of trials is the number of people who received the tweets. Since I have sent the two different tweets to exactly the same group, I can assume that the sample size is the same for both samples. The few people who started following me or who left me in the hours between the tweets can safely be ignored. So we can say that the total number of trials is the sum of the followers of both Twitter accounts used in the experiment.  Lets <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html#!382/7000;438/7000@95">calculate</a>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Ad content</th>
      <th># successes</th>
      <th># trials</th>
      <th>Confidence interval</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shortener</td>
      <td>382</td>
      <td>7000</td>
      <td>4.9% - 6%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NoShortener</td>
      <td>438</td>
      <td>7000</td>
      <td>5.7% - 6.8%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The verdict is that the &lsquo;NoShortener&rsquo; sample group is <strong>more successful</strong> (p = 0.0439).</p>

<h2>My conclusion</h2>

<p>For me the results are clear, this small test confirmed my hypothesis. Since using a URL shortener does <strong>not have any benefits</strong> for me and it even <strong>reduces clicks</strong> on the links I tweet, I will not use them anymore.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2014/05/22/hidden-configuration-options.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-05-22 16:27:00 &#43;0100">May 22, 2014</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Version 2 of the popular OS X task management application <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> is about to be released today. I have been testing the beta versions for some time and have seen how the software matured little by little.</p>

<p>Version 2 defers from the previous version in almost every aspect; it contains new features such as the review and forecast perspectives and also the user interface has been modernised. Especially the latter gave rise to many discussions on the support forums about the <a href="http://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/how-can-the-data-density-be-improved/86">data density of the new design</a>. Eventually, the Omni Group <a href="http://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/alternate-layout-which-displays-everything-on-one-line-with-status-circles-on-the-left/1697">published a <em>hack</em></a> to change the layout of the task list back to a table of tasks more similar to Omnifocus 1.</p>

<p>This made me wonder what other &lsquo;secret&rsquo; configuration options exist. So far, I have been able to compile the following list.</p>

<p>All configuration options are activated by opening a special URL starting with <code>omnifocus:///change-preference</code> in your browser, which opens Omnifocus and applies the configuration. The URLs in the list are clickable to apply the configuration directly form this post.</p>

<h3>Alternate layout</h3>

<p>Use <a href="///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout=compact</code></a> to switch to the compact layout, which only uses one line per task.  Note that this layout is experimental and still has some issues. To return to the default layout you can use <a href="///change-preference?ContentLayout"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ContentLayout</code></a>. The alternative layout looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/f8c1ad875e.png" width="600" height="95" alt="Alternative layout for Omnifocus" /></p>

<h3>Hide empty contexts in the main outline</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in a perspective grouped by context, you&rsquo;ll see that empty perspectives will also show up in the main outline, to mike it easier to reassign tasks by dragging them to another context. If you would rather not see them, you can remove the empty contexts from the main outline with <a href="///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MainOutlineIncludesEmptyContexts=false</code></a>. You can also pass the parameter <code>true</code> to reactivate the empty contexts.</p>

<h3>Hide On Hold projects in forecast view</h3>

<p>If you put a project on hold, it&rsquo;s tasks will still show up in the forecast view. The reasoning is that even though the project is on hold, its tasks still have a due date. If you prefer not to see those tasks on the forecast view, disable them using <a href="///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold=false</code></a>. Use <a href="///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastIncludesProjectsOnHold</code></a> to restore the default setting.</p>

<h3>Reorganise the side bar</h3>

<p>This &lsquo;hack&rsquo; is a little bit more complicated. The issue was that the order of the perspectives in the sidebar could not be reorganised. Note that in the final release the default perspectives behave just like any other perspective, and can be organised in any way you like it. However, if you want to freak out with URL schemes, this is the way:</p>

<p>The default perspectives are on top (Inbox, Projects, Contexts&hellip;), followed by any starred perspectives. To add another perspective, you first have to star the perspective and open the URL <a href="///change-preference?SidebarTabs"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs</code></a> to get a list of the current tabs. Note the ID of the starred perspective, <code>hdDT8UyDkVe</code> in this case:</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/2935404eb4.png" width="534" height="452" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you know the ID of your custom perspective, you can define the order of the tabs with <a href="///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?SidebarTabs=(hdDT8UyDkVe,ForecastTab,InboxTab)</code></a></p>

<h3>Send clippings directly to the inbox</h3>

<p>Whenever you <em>clip</em> something from another application, the Quick Entry window shows up so you can specify some further meta-information about the task &ndash; project, context, dates&hellip; &ndash; and change the task description. If you would rather send the clipped information directly to the Omnifocus inbox, use the configuration URL <a href="///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ClippingsGoToQuickEntry=false</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Sync settings</h3>

<p>There are two setting for configuring the synchronisation interval. First, you can set the maximum sync time &ndash;in seconds &ndash; with <a href="///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync=600</code></a> (this sets the maximum to 10 minutes). Use <a href="///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?MaximumTimeBetweenSync</code></a> to restore the default setting of one hour.</p>

<p>The other option is for setting how long after making an edit Omnifocus should synchronise. The URL is <a href="///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync=15</code></a> and <a href="///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?TimeFromFirstEditToSync</code></a> to get back to the default setting of one minute.</p>

<h3>Toolbar colour</h3>

<p>If you have setup your mac to use the &lsquo;Graphite&rsquo; appearance instead of the default &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; theme, Omnifocus will have black and white icons in the toolbar instead of the modern coloured icons. If you prefer this to be different, you can use <a href="///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=aqua</code></a> to force the use of coloured buttons or <a href="///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint=graphite</code></a> to get the black and white icons in the toolbar. As usual, with <a href="///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ToolbarItemTint</code></a> you&rsquo;ll go back to the default setting.</p>

<h3>Set defer date when dragging a task in Forecast view</h3>

<p>This option was contributed by Colter in the comments of this post. When in Forecast view, you can drag a task to another date in the calendar to change its due date. You can change the defer date instead by holding the ⌘ key. If you would like to change the defer date by default, you can use the URL <a href="///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true"><code>omnifocus:///change-preference?ForecastDragSetsDeferDate=true</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Change the project hierarchy separator character</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using folders, OmniFocus will show the complete path in the project selection drop-down list using a colon as the hierarchy separation character, e.g. <code>Personal : Finance</code>. You can configure the character used to separate the project hierarchy with the URL <a href="%20"><code>omnifocus:///change-setting?OFMNamedObjectHierarchicalNameSeparator=%20:%20</code></a> (note that <code>%20</code> is the code for a space).</p>

<p>Please leave a comment if you know of any other configuration option for Omnifocus 2; I will keep this post up-to-date.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In preparation for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a> launch in autumn, I have been thinking about its impact on my use of Apple services. Our family uses several <em>iDevices</em> and the better syncing options offered by iCloud will be very welcome. However, I have some concerns about purchasing and synching.</p>

<p>At this moment I use two different accounts to access Apple&rsquo;s services: I have a regular Apple ID which I use for purchasing Apps and home sharing media, and I also have a <a href="http://www.me.com/">MobileMe</a> account for synching data between my Macbook and the iPhone. The MobileMe account is used just by me, while all iDevices share the same Apple ID for the obvious reason that I don&rsquo;t want to purchase apps twice. Furthermore, by using two separate accounts we are able to access all iTunes libraries from the AppleTV, without being obliged to synchronize calendars as well, as those are being synched using another account. In short: the Apple ID identifies the family/home, while MobileMe is used to identify a person.</p>

<p>When Apple activates iCloud, my Apple ID will also become the <em>token</em> for synching information, which is a problem for me. I would like to continue using the Apple ID to make purchases for the whole family and stream media between the devices of our family, while on the other hand each member needs a personal ID for synching calendars, mail accounts and other personal data. When Apple closes MobileMe I will be forced to sync my calendar through iCloud, but my wife has no interest at all in my appointments (and vice versa).</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to find out, iCloud will not offer such granularity. I assume that my situation is quite common and that many families with several devices will face the same issue. Does anybody know a solution for this problem, or do we simply have to wait for the final version of iCloud and hope that Apple has already a solution?</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2011/06/28/googles-step-verification.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-06-28 15:58:01 &#43;0100">Jun 28, 2011</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Google has released a new security measure to help you protect your ever increasing amount of data stored on their servers. This <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsAuthConfig">2-step authentication</a> means that when you log in to your Google account with your username and password, you will receive a code by SMS message. Only after entering this code you will be able to get to your data.</p>

<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data on Google&rsquo;s servers (I hardly ever use Gmail or Google Docs, mainly just <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>) I thought that it was a good idea to activate this service &ndash; better safe than sorry, right?</p>

<h3>Activating 2-step verification</h3>

<p>So I went ahead and activated the service. The procedure is fairly easy: First you switch the service on, then you configure your mobile phone number and activate it with the code you receive by SMS. Finally you have the possibility to print out a list of <em>backup verification codes</em>. Google advices you to keep this list in your wallet, which I found very strange: if you loose your wallet, you give the lucky &lsquo;finder&rsquo; the possibility to get into your Google account <strong>without</strong> needing the SMS confirmation.</p>

<p>I immediately tried it out by opening Google Reader, and yes: after I gave my Google credentials I received a SMS message with a new code from Google. They appear to be sending them from the UK, which means that &ndash;with the current roaming rates in Europe&ndash; they are willing to spend a small fortune on better security. When I entered the verification code I noticed that fortunately there is a possibility to remember the verification on a computer for 30 days. It worked!</p>

<h3>External applications</h3>

<p>Satisfied I closed the browser Window and went on with other issues. Later that day I opened <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on my iPhone to read some news, but got an error. It appears that by activating the 2-step verification all access from external applications is blocked automatically. To re-enable access to your Google account from a third-party application, you will have to generate a special password for that application only:</p>

<blockquote>
  Some mobile or desktop applications that work outside of a browser aren't yet compatible with 2-step verification. These applications are hard-coded to ask for a username and password, and do not prompt for a verification code. If you want one of these applications to access your Google Account, you must enter an application-specific password, not your Google Account password, when asked for a password.
</blockquote>

<p>I went ahead and generated passwords for IMAP access, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for iPhone, FlipBook, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for iPad, <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> and a bunch of other applications. After generating each password, Google warns you that you will not be able to see the password anymore once you close the screen, so I made sure to configure each application immediately and test it before going on with the next application.</p>

<h3>Does it make sense?</h3>

<p>After a while I started wondering what the heck I was doing. On one side I had made my account more secure, because whenever I access my account through the browser I have to give the SMS verification code. However, if instead of the browser I access my data through an external application, I can choose from a whole list of valid passwords for my account. API access went from a single username/password combination to a whole bunch of passwords valid for the same username.</p>

<p>I know that Google sees the browser window as the principal interface to their services, and for users who work that way, the 2-step notification process is quite an improvement.  However, I see the browser as just one of the many interfaces/applications I use to access my data on Google&rsquo;s servers. To me it makes no sense that &ndash;even though one application increased its security&ndash; the security level for all other applications is significantly lowered.</p>

<p>I finally disabled the 2-step notification for my Google account, when I found out that I can&rsquo;t use Google anymore as my <a href="http://smarterware.org/6286/how-to-set-up-openid-on-your-own-domain">OpenID provider</a>, since I am required to generate a new password for each blog or web &ndash;those that require registration&ndash; I want to comment on. Too much of a hassle to be functional&hellip;</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2011/06/23/welcome-back-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-06-23 12:12:48 &#43;0100">Jun 23, 2011</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After some weeks of work &ndash;though I only spend 1-2 hours every week on this project&ndash; I am re-releasing <a href="http://braintags.com">brain tags</a>. I have lost the count of the <em>version numbers</em> of this blog, but is should probably the 6th or 7th overhaul. I am very excited about it, as I see it as a fresh start with some important changes:</p>

<h3>A new CMS</h3>

<p>After many, many years, I have exported all data from my old <a href="http://movabletype.com">Movable Type Pro</a> installation, and installed a fresh copy of <a href="http://openmelody.org">Melody</a> on a fresh new account. For those who are not familiar with those two applications, Melody is a fork Movable Type version 4.</p>

<p>I choose to move to Melody for several reasons. First of all, I was not completely happy with the latest versions of Movable Type, which added a lot of unneeded bloat, such as the possibility to create <em>sites</em>. In fact, Movable Type obliges you to first create a <em>site</em> to be able to create a weblog. But the biggest reason is the fact that support for Movable Type is decreasing, now that the <a href="http://sixapart.com">owner</a> is focussed on advertising, and development on Movable Type takes place in Japan.</p>

<p>Melody was created by two former employees of <a href="http://sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> &ndash;one of them was product manager for Movable Type&ndash; and a very active community member. They have already been able to solve a lot of the main issues in Movable Type in Melody, and I simply trust more in them than in the current developers of Movable Type.</p>

<p>A final note on the change: while both Melody and Movable Type can handle multiple blogs and I traditionally have managed all my blogs from a single installation, I am now separating them again. This way I can make my customizations without making my other blogs more complex. It also gives me a way to test out things.</p>

<h3>A new theme</h3>

<p>Melody comes with a very nice minimalistic theme as the default theme, <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/516">DePo Clean</a>, and I decided to keep it. For the moment I haven&rsquo;t personalized the templates, though I did fix some minor bugs in the theme. Once I figure out how to make <code>diff</code> files, I will probably submit the patches to the Melody developers.</p>

<p>I do have a list of wishes and desires for the theme, so don&rsquo;t be surprised when things change over time.</p>

<h3>Comments are disabled</h3>

<p>Even though the combined Akismet and Typepad spam filters are very effective, I still had to deal with several comments in the moderation queue every week. Since nowadays there are plenty of other ways to express your opinion, I have disabled the comments function. If you want to share your opinion, feel free to send me a [tweet]<a href="http://twitter.com/JeroenSangers">6</a> or <a href="http://jeroensangers.com/Acerca-de-Jeroen/Contacto">mail</a>.</p>

<h3>Less images, more text</h3>

<p>When importing the old entries, I left out all decorational images. In the last years, I always accompanied each post with an image to make the post more attractive. Those images are now gone, you will only find images which help making my point. I want the focus to be on my words, and will also try to write longer, more thoughtful posts from now on.</p>

<p>I am very excited about this new start. What do you think?</p>

         	<p>Starting Monday May 23rd I will be moving this blog to a <a href="http://openmelody.org/">new platform</a> on a new server. This migration serves as a test for the migration of <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> and I will be trying out many different things in order to make the migration of <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> run smoothly.</p>
<p>Since my available time is limited and I can only dedicate a few hours per week to this test, I expect <strong>Brain Tags</strong> to be down during a significant period of time (read: days).</p>
<p>The reason for moving from my beloved <a href="http://movabletype.com/">Movable Type Pro</a> to <a href="http://openmelody.org/">Melody</a> (a fork of MT) is simply the fact that most of the community effort has moved to Melody and I expect a better support in the future now that the development of MT only takes place in Japan.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The mobile revolution is shaking up the software market. Old paradigms (bigger is better) disappear and new ones are created.</p>

<p>One area where these changes are specifically noticeable is the relation between applications and the file system.</p>

<p>Most computing environments are in what I call the second generation, where the file system is the dominant part of this relation. The file is the centre of our activities. To start working we open a file and the associated application is automatically launched. We only start application directly when we want to create a new file.</p>

<p>This has not always been like this: in the past (first generation) the applications were the core, where applications gave access to data on the mainframe or in databases. There are some situations where we work in applications without having any idea of the underlying file- or database structure. E-mail is one of the uses of this system.</p>

<p>Like I said, the mobile revolution is changing this again. Mobile operating systems as iOS, Symbian and Android give very limited access to the file system and force us back to the mainframe era. Even the <em>desktop</em> operating systems don&rsquo;t give you direct access to the file system anymore, but rather a virtual system mounted on top of the real file system.</p>

<p>It looks like file system abstraction is the future, but I don&rsquo;t think that applications will be the centre of our universe. The operating system of the future won&rsquo;t be centred on files or applications, but will use processes and tasks as the leading parameter.</p>

<p>In the operating system of the future, you will be able to say that you want to write, and a simple text editor will open. The moment you access more advanced editing functions, the application will automatically switch to another editing engine. Of course, you text is automatically saved and can be used in many ways.</p>

<p>In the future, operating systems will actually help you being productive. Trust me.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2010/04/30/comments-and-tweets.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2010-04-30 12:25:38 &#43;0100">Apr 30, 2010</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A recent trend in the blogosphere has been to add <strong>tweets as comments</strong> on posts. I understand where this comes from, as in general commenting on blog posts has decreased in favour of twittering. By adding all tweets mentioning your blog posts, your posts look more alive and will probably attract more readers.</p>

<p>Whenever I think about features for my blogs, I always ask myself what the value is for my readers. In the case of tweets as comments, I look for the answer based on my own experiences. It happens frequently that I find an interesting post with let&rsquo;s say 20 comments. When I finished reading this, otherwise interesting, blog post and get ready for participating in the conversation, I find out that there actually are only two real comments, followed by a tweet of the author and 17 retweets adding absolutely nothing to the post or the conversation. Immediately my motivation to participate in the conversation is gone and I quickly move on to the next blog.</p>

<p>Although in theory tweets are comments about your posts (or at least mentioning the post), they hardly ever contribute to the discussion. If you absolutely want to display the tweets on your blog post, go ahead, but don&rsquo;t mix them with the comments. If in the example above the tweets would have been separated from the comments and the blogs metadata would have shown me that the post has 2 comments and 18 tweets, I would not be so disappointed and probably would have left a comment as well.</p>

<p><strong>A comment is a comment and a tweet is a tweet</strong>.</p>

         	<p>Ante la inclusión en el Anteproyecto de Ley de Economía sostenible de modificaciones legislativas que afectan al libre ejercicio de las libertades de expresión, información y el derecho de acceso a la cultura a través de Internet, los periodistas, bloggers, usuarios, profesionales y creadores de internet manifestamos nuestra firme oposición al proyecto, y declaramos que&hellip;</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Los derechos de autor no pueden situarse por encima de los derechos fundamentales</strong> de los ciudadanos, como el derecho a la privacidad, a la seguridad, a la presunción de inocencia, a la tutela judicial efectiva y a la libertad de expresión.</li>
    <li><strong>La suspensión de derechos fundamentales es y debe seguir siendo competencia exclusiva del poder judicial</strong>. Ni un cierre sin sentencia. Este anteproyecto, en contra de lo establecido en el artículo 20.5 de la Constitución, pone en manos de un órgano no judicial --un organismo dependiente del ministerio de Cultura--, la potestad de impedir a los ciudadanos españoles el acceso a cualquier página web.</li>
    <li><strong>La nueva legislación creará inseguridad jurídica en todo el sector tecnológico español</strong>, perjudicando uno de los pocos campos de desarrollo y futuro de nuestra economía, entorpeciendo la creación de empresas, introduciendo trabas a la libre competencia y ralentizando su proyección internacional.</li>
    <li><strong>La nueva legislación propuesta amenaza a los nuevos creadores y entorpece la creación cultural</strong>. Con Internet y los sucesivos avances tecnológicos se ha democratizado extraordinariamente la creación y emisión de contenidos de todo tipo, que ya no provienen prevalentemente de las industrias culturales tradicionales, sino de multitud de fuentes diferentes.</li>
    <li><strong>Los autores, como todos los trabajadores, tienen derecho a vivir de su trabajo con nuevas ideas creativas</strong>, modelos de negocio y actividades asociadas a sus creaciones. Intentar sostener con cambios legislativos a una industria obsoleta que no sabe adaptarse a este nuevo entorno no es ni justo ni realista. Si su modelo de negocio se basaba en el control de las copias de las obras y en Internet no es posible sin vulnerar derechos fundamentales, deberían buscar otro modelo.</li>
    <li><strong>Consideramos que las industrias culturales necesitan para sobrevivir alternativas modernas, eficaces, creíbles y asequibles</strong> y que se adecuen a los nuevos usos sociales, en lugar de limitaciones tan desproporcionadas como ineficaces para el fin que dicen perseguir.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet debe funcionar de forma libre y sin interferencias políticas</strong> auspiciadas por sectores que pretenden perpetuar obsoletos modelos de negocio e imposibilitar que el saber humano siga siendo libre.</li>
    <li><strong>Exigimos que el Gobierno garantice por ley la neutralidad de la Red en España</strong>, ante cualquier presión que pueda producirse, como marco para el desarrollo de una economía sostenible y realista de cara al futuro.</li>
    <li><strong>Proponemos una verdadera reforma del derecho de propiedad intelectual</strong> orientada a su fin: devolver a la sociedad el conocimiento, promover el dominio público y limitar los abusos de las entidades gestoras.</li>
    <li><strong>En democracia las leyes y sus modificaciones deben aprobarse tras el oportuno debate público y habiendo consultado previamente a todas las partes implicadas</strong>. No es de recibo que se realicen cambios legislativos que afectan a derechos fundamentales en una ley no orgánica y que versa sobre otra materia.</li>
</ol>

<p>When I have time I will try to fix it or I will simply remove the fancy AJAX part. I&rsquo;ll keep you informed.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2009.03.16]</strong> I have removed all AJAX stuff from the templates, so commenting should be possible again. I still have to remove some rough edges though.</p>

This year has been been a huge success for our company, mainly because we had a better place for our booth and because we presented right in the middle of this crisis a revolutionary low cost product on which we have been working for three years (sometimes you need a little bit of luck).</p>
<p>The show has been such a success that this year I haven't been able to visit the other halls of the show to see what is happening in the IT sector. Anyway, nowadays we don't depend on big trade shows anymore to inform us about the latest new products.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the most interesting parts for web site owners are the access statistics, and Google Analytics offers one of the most complete statistics solutions, which I use on a weekly basis for my most successful blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

<p>Besides being a typical blog with pages, I offer <a href="http://canasto.es/calendario-compacto/">calendars</a> for downloading, and of course I also want to track those downloads. When two years ago I started with the downloads I search Google&rsquo;s help files for a solution to track them, and found a small javascript sniplet that when a visitor clicks on a download link registers the download as a pageview. This trick allowed me to analyse the downloads.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this trick is that it inflates the pageviews, and I never have been completely satisfied about this solution. You can imagine my happiness when last week I discovered the <strong>Event Tracking</strong> feature, designed specifically to track downloads, videoplays, etc.</p>

<p>I quickly changed my code to use a javascript sniplet like the following:</p>

<pre>onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackEvent('Downloads',
'XLSX', '/calendario-compacto/calendario-compacto-2009'); "</pre>

<p>This sniplet registers the download under the category <em>Downloads</em>, the action <em>XLS</em> and the label <em>/calendario-compacto/calendario-compacto-2009</em>. Google Analytics has Event reports by category, action and level, so now I know for example which of the four file file formats are more popular:</p>

Image taken from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/absolutesubzero/luis-suarez-international-forum-on-enterprise-20">Luis Suárez</a></p>

<p>Last weekend I attended the <a href="http://eventoblog.com/">Evento Blog España</a> conference in Seville, and one of the more attractive talks on the schedule was called 2.0 services and technology in business by <a href="http://www.elsua.net/">Luis Suárez</a>, technology evangelist at IBM.</p>

<p>Luis explained how he stopped using e-mail completely and replaced the functionality by a variety of web 2.0 tools, each specialized for a specific task. When he started talking, I remembered how Tim Ferriss also &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; e-mail in his book.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307353133">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, Tim explains how he only reads his e-mail a few times per day while an autoresponder tells the senders to use the phone instead for more urgent messages. I have read it several times, but I still can&rsquo;t see where the productivity increase comes from. I&rsquo;d rather check my e-mail twice a day to reduce phone calls. In my opinion, phone calls are a bigger time waster that e-mail. When someone phones you, that person decides for you that the issue he is phoning about is at that moment more important than all other issues you are working on. A phone call is almost always an interruption in your workflow, while e-mail is part of the workflow. Of course, there are times when a phone call is justified, for example when a customer is having technical problems that stopped his business. The idea is to use the right tool for the job, and in the past years I have spend quite some time explaining that the phone usually is not the right tool and that e-mail or IM for more time-dependant questions are more adequate.</p>

<p>Using the right tool for the job is exactly why Luis Suárez stopped using e-mail and changed it for instant messaging, wikis, blogs, rss, bookmark services, quickr, etc. In principle I agree with Luis that e-mail is not always the best tool to use, but at this moment there is a scattering problem when using web 2.0 tools. I already noticed this when I try to convince people to stop phoning me and use IM instead. There is a myriad of IM tools and protocols available, and to be able to communicate with all my customers I need ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Messenger, Skype and GTalk. <strong>All of them!</strong> I am a tech savvy guy, so I can handle this (all accounts are nicely accessible from one client: Digsby), but this surely is no option for many other people, who already find it very difficult to install one IM client.</p>

<p>Now imagine the same thing happening with all other functions of e-mail. To collaborate on a document there are dozens of services available. Of course I will choose one of them, but will me customer also use that? Of course not, they use Google Docs instead of a wiki. And as I cooperate with more people, my shared work will be shattered across the internet. I remember a customer send me a link to an interesting article, but where is it? I need to maintain a database to know that this particular customer uses Delicious to share bookmarks.</p>

<p>You can say a lot about e-mail. It is not the perfect tool for collaboration or status reporting. <strong>But it is a standard</strong>. Everybody has e-mail, and everybody knows how to use it. And if you work together with many customers, using web 2.0 solutions will not be an option in the majority of cases, until there will be a common protocol or tool such as Digsby for IM that allows people using different services for a functionality to cooperate.</p>

<p>Lately I notice more and more cards driving around in Lleida with the Apple logo, and each time I see one I think by myself “why on earth would somebody stick that onto his car?” I also have that sticker at home, but it never occurred to me to stick it on my car.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple is a cool brand, is different and has a very nice logo. But whichever way I look at it, I see it as a profitable company, and sticking that logo on your car is free publicity for this company.</p>
<p>I guess it is the same people buying Bikkembergs shoes (if you remove the logo nothing is left) and certain Nike sportswear (a manufacturer logo on clothes should never be bigger than 2cm and preferably not visible at all) without asking any payment from the manufacturer in return.</p>
<p>In fact, the only logo I wear on my clothes is the logo of my employer, and only because they pay me to do so!</p>
<p>In my opinion, driving around with an Apple logo does not make you look cool, but rather stupid for making free publicity for a company.</p>

<p>Since I started writing on my Spanish productivity blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>, I had less time to write on Brain Tags. But it looks like it was worth any minute of my time, as today I received the good news that El Canasto has been <a href="http://www.adn.es/blog/premios-bitacoras/tecnologia/20081110/POS-0016-premios-bitacoras-2008.html">nominated for one of the Premios Bitacoras.com</a>, the Spanish Bloggies.</p>
<p>The past month, Spanish blog readers could vote for their favourite blogs in several categories. El Canasto quickly took the lead in the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong> category, and maintained the first position until the end of the voting period.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the jury will be announced, and they have until Friday to choose among the top three of each category, which means that I have about 33% chance of winning the price.</p>
<p>What makes me even more proud is that El Canasto ended at the 10th position on the list of most voted blogs, which in my opinion is really good for a blog in a not so mainstream niche.</p>
<p>The final winners will be announced this Saturday in Seville, and of course I am going to be there to see whether I won the price and to meet a lot of other bloggers. The winner will take a statue and a Toshiba NB100 home.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to let go some good habits to adapt yourself. When I came to live in Spain, I was used to drive all day with the lights of my car turned on for better visibility.</p>
<p>However, the people over here do not have that custom, and friendly as they are, they tried to warn me to tell that I forgot to turn off my lights. That is nice if it happens a few times, but actually it happened several times a day, and after a week I was getting quite fed-up with it. So I stopped driving with the lights turned on during daytime.</p>
<p>This week, the Spanish government started a campaign to tell people about the enhanced security when driving with the car lights turned on. Guess who is happily driving around with the lights on again?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.eventoblog.com/">EBE</a> is Europe's second largest blogging event (after Les Blogs in France) and will take place in November in Sevilla. And yes, on November 14 I will take the airplane to Sevilla to be present at this event.</p>
<p>When the event was first announced I doubted whether I should participate due to the high costs (plane ticket and accommodation; the EBE itself is free) and decided not to go.</p>
<p>What made me change my mind? Well, part of the program is the election of the best Spanish blogs, and my blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> makes a very good chance of being elected as the <strong>Best Business Blog</strong>! In the last partial rankings I held the first position, while previously I was number two.</p>
<p>Of course, the EBE is also a great place to meet some people in real life, people I have been working with for quite some time. I am also looking forward to meeting tons of new people, making new connections and new plans…</p>
<p>I am looking forward to participate at the Evento Blog España.</p>

<p>Today is Blog Action Day, a day on which thousands of bloggers write about the same topic to raise awareness, and this year's theme is <strong>Poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="/2007/10/frugal-camping.php">last year</a>, I signed up to participate without thinking. But now that I start writing I realise that I am by far the right person for writing on this topic. Right now I am sitting in my own house behind my €1400 Macbook with a high speed broadband internet connection. What am I supposed to know about poverty? I (and all my readers as well) probably belong to the richest 1% of the world.</p>
<p>For me poverty is something they show on TV. Only once in a while I see poor people begging for money on the street, and I know that I can ignore them because I happen to live in a country with excellent social services that will take care of these people. For my own conscience, I make my contributions to some NGO's to pay of my guilt debt. When I read back these lines, it sounds very cold, which is not how I am, but there is a great deal of truth in it.</p>
<p>Only twice in my life I actually saw poverty with my own eyes, when I visited Lesotho and Thailand, and it greatly affected me. More than that, it made me realise how lucky I am. We dedicate about 2% of our income to charity, which is an amount we won't even miss, but which makes a great difference for the people depending on it.</p>
<p>I encourage everybody reading this to do the same: realise how lucky and incredibly rich you are, and donate 1-2% of your income. Together we can stop poverty.</p>

<p>I just found a very interesting plugin for Movable Type: <a href="http://code.as-is.net/public/wiki/TagSupplementals_Plugin">TagSupplementals</a>. As the name says, the plugin provides extra features for working with tags.</p>
<p>I am using the plugin on El Canasto to create a Related Entries list on each individual entry page. The related entries feature of this plugin has two weighing modes: <em>constant</em> gives each tag the same weight and simply sums up the number of tags the entries have in common, while <em>idf</em> gives each tag a weight of <code>1/freq</code>, where <code>freq</code> is the number of entries tagged with that tag.</p>
<p>Other features of the plugin, which I currently don't use, are: a tag count, related tags, a listing of all tags used in an archive, tag last update date, etc.</p>

<p>But yesterday I found out that I can make my links in Delicious available in <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/projects/quicksilver.html">Quicksilver</a>, which means that I have a ton of information available with just a few keyboard clics. Instantly I am very interested in Delicious again, and surely will start bookmarking more sites again.</p>

         	<p>Today I launched the new design for Brain Tags. For a while I have been using the default theme provided by <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a>, but after updating the blogging engine to version 4.2 I decided to make some changes to make fully use of the new features offered by this version.</p>

<p>The theme I used is called <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/themes/mid-century.html">Mid-Century</a> and is a good example of the possibilities of the latest version of Movable Type Pro. To improve speed and stability, I used a static publishing model, while using cached modules for some of the sidebar widgets. That way I can easily update for example my Latest Comments widget without having to rebuild all individual archive files.</p>

<p>With this redesign I also stopped using Google Adsense, as the income generated was simply too low to justify its use.</p>

<p>In the coming days I will probably be making some little adjustments to adapt the new design to my tastes and needs.</p>

<p>For a long time <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">SmartFTP</a> was my favourite FTP application for Windows, and I have recommended it to many friends. However, SmartFTP suddenly has <a href="http://smartftp.com/purchase/free.php">changed their licensing structure</a> and is now obliging me to purchase a license. Of course, I immediately uninstalled the software and installed <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, which for sure is going to stay for free.</p>

<p>My macbook has been without backups for several months now, so I started looking for a backup solution. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> is out of the question, as I don't want to hook up a USB hard disk while I'm working (and when I don't work I don't want to leave my macbook switched on) and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">Time Capsule</a> is out of my budget.</p>
<p>On my PC I happily use <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/raf/signup.aspx?RAFUserUID=10773">Carbonite</a>, but they haven't released a version for mac yet. I have read some good things about <a href="http://mozy.com/home">Mozy</a> though, so I decided to give it a try. I signed up for the MozyHome Free account to test the service, installed the software and selected some backup sets to start with. A few hours later the initial backup was ready (I only selected 250Mb).</p>
<p>Happy with the results, I changed user to do the same, but Mozy could not find any files because it was still looking for files in <code>/home/Jeroen</code>. This very much surprised me, as I was used to Carbonite running as a service and being able to backup files from all users. I assumed that Mozy would not work the same, but that I could configure the files to backup on a per user basis. I couldn't find how to do so... I checked the FAQs on the Mozy site, but most of the texts have been written for Windows users.</p>
<p>And today I received an e-mail from Mozy explaining me how to get started with Mozy… on Windows.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to do with the software. The initial backup went fine, but it is a real bummer that the backup is limited to only one user.</p>

         	<p>That is the question I have been asking myself a lot this year. In the past I always had a clear answer to this question, but lately I struggle with the aim of this site, which is why it has been very silent over here.</p>

<p>The first incarnation of Brain Tags was simply to inform my friends abroad about what was going on in my life, which was a very novel idea back in 1997.
The second incarnation of Brain Tags in 2001 still had the same aim, but intense due to my emigration to Spain.</p>

<p>After some years the content started shifting to include web design and other technology topics. I got settled in Spain, and my daily life was not so interesting anymore…</p>

<p>And now that blogging has become very mainstream (my wifes mobile phone comes with a blogging client installed!) and there are a thousand blogs writing essentially the same, I wonder what the place of Brain Tags is.</p>

<p>For a while I thought about closing Brain Tags, but then I decided that I do have a very clear and sometimes unique opinion about many subjects. So I do want to continue writing here, but probably in a different format. I think that shorter articles with some original thinking (less copying/forwarding stuff from others) will be the way to go. I will also incorporate some other things such as <a href="http://twitter.com/JeroenSangers">Twitter</a> steams etc. in the blog design.</p>

<p>Be prepared for changes, Brain Tags is alive!</p>

<p>For a while I have been using <a href="http://www.twitterfeed.com/">TwitterFeed</a> to automatically announce new blog posts on <a href="http://twitter.com/Jeroensangers">Twitter</a>, but I stopped using their services and am considering to stop following others who are announcing every single post on Twitter.</p>
<p>I love Twitter to follow what people are doing, and what they are thinking, but in most cases I am not interested in every blog post. And if I am, I simply add their blog to my feedreader. It is OK with me if you point out some of your excellent blog post in Twitter, but, please don't make it automatic. In my opinion, TwitterFeed only adds noise to Twitter.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are also on Twitter, my ID is <a href="http://twitter.com/Jeroensangers">JeroenSangers</a>. I am also on <a href="http://friendfeed.com/jeroensangers">FriendFeed</a>, with he same ID.</p>

<p>The past three years The Wizard of POS had established itself as the leading weblog about Point Of Sale software and hardware, but I simple lacked the time and focus to continue working on it. When I got pinged about the possibilities of selling the Wizard I did not have to think a lot.

<blockquote>So, in Notes 8.5 you will see an Inbox that's easier to scan, with 10 improved icons for mail message types. The biggest changes are removing the icon for read mail and using a blue star for unread mail. We also adjusted meeting workflow items so that the most time-dependent ones (e.g., new invitation, reschedules, cancellations) stand out and those that are not so time-dependant (e.g., an invitee has accepted your meeting) are subtler. No other changes were made to the icon grid.</blockquote>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am multi-lingual: born Dutch, living in Spain and speaking English for most part of the working day.</p>
<p>In the past it was easy to choose the language to use: Dutch, unless the other person doesn't speak Dutch, in which case I spoke English. I also choose English as my preferred language for everything related with IT, as more software and documentation is available in English, and because of the horrible translations in the first Dutch operating systems.</p>
<p>When I moved to Spain, I only knew a little bit of Spanish, so I decided to dive into it, and convert my whole life to Spanish. I wrote my own personal notes in Spanish, my PCs had the Spanish version of Windows, my to-do lists and calendar were in Spanish, and little by little my Spanish improved.</p>
<p>Now that I have lived here for a little bit more than six years, doing everything in Spanish started to feel a little bit forced. A few months back I changed the language of my mobile phone to English, and suddenly I realized that it is indeed possible to fit the texts on the tiny screen. My phone instantly became easier to use.</p>
<p>Then I got a new laptop. Though initially and by habit installed in Spanish, I felt more at home when I changed it into English (fortunately, in Mac OS X the operating system language is a user preference, so I didn't need to reinstall). And since the tools I worked with are in English, I also enter the data (to-do items, appointments, etc.) in English.</p>
<p>For each aspect of my life, I choose whether it is best to do in Dutch, English or Spanish. For example, whenever I am writing on El Canasto, I prefer that everything is in Spanish in order not to lose any time translating. Therefore, my brainstorming, saved text fragments and Movable Type are in Spanish. I also found that even though I am fully trilingual, you can't beat 37 years of experience in a language. Deeper thinking and difficult tasks are thus easier to do in Dutch.</p>
<p>You see: each language has its place.</p>

         	<p>First there where blogs, then came the e-books and now there are <strong>Interactive Learning Environments</strong> (ILE). Building an ILE is a novel way of sharing your knowledge. For the last two months I have been following the <a href="http://teachingsells.com/?ref=ebdbbfb9&amp;pid=c4a0577c"><strong>Teaching Sells</strong></a> course, and I am very enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p>The course is divided into five parts: Instructional design, marketing, creating multi-media content, business models and building membership sites. The more technical parts are not that interesting for me (just some links to the software used is enough for me), but the other three courses are well worth the money. Furthermore, the forums already brought some very good contacts, and I might be setting up some joint-ventures to start building membership sites.</p>

<p>My first ILE project will probably be a Spanish productivity course (what else?), on which I will start working in a few months (of course I am already doing some brainstorming now…)</p>

         	<p>Let&rsquo;s continue our trip through the history of Brain Tags at 1998, my second year of blogging.</p>

<p>I celebrated my birthday party in <a href="http://www.jnharmelen.nl/">De Jeugdhof</a>, and after cleaning the floor we forgot to close the fire hose. The next morning when we came back to finish cleaning we encountered a swimming pool instead of our cleaned floor. <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/1998/03/pittig-feestje/">Oops</a>…</p>

<p>I also went to Africa and visited the very interesting country of Lesotho. Of course, still being a rookie blogger I only <a href="/1998/09/kaderschouw/">slightly mentioned</a> this instead of writing a post with high Google juice. Missed change indeed.</p>

<p>I also had the worst skin problems I remember and had to stay home for several days because <a href="/1998/10/ontsteking/">my face was severely infected</a>. I still don&rsquo;t know what caused it (<a href="http://braintags.com/archives/1998/05/">allergy</a>?, stress?), but fortunately it didn&rsquo;t return after 1998.</p>

<p>Then there were of course some stories about Jong Nederland, such as <a href="/1998/09/kaderschouw/">kaderschouw</a>, the <a href="/1998/11/nacht-van-16/">Night of 16+</a>, planning the <a href="/1998/12/brainstormen-en-volleybal/">EuroContact</a> and the famous <a href="/1998/12/brainstormen-en-volleybal/">volleyball tournament</a> of the Utrecht district.</p>

<p>It is good habit to add a personal note when inviting someone to connect through <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sangers">LinkedIn</a> to explain how you know the other person and why you want to connect. However, lately I noticed a small inconvenience with this approach:</p>
<p>I invited a few people with a personalised note and instead of the acceptation of the invitation I received a reply to my note.</p>
<p>It is no big problem, as I simply reply back and ask them to accept my invitation. Maybe LinkedIn could think of a 'Reply & Accept' button?</p>

         	<p>As I have been <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/11/10-years-of-blogging/">blogging for 10 years</a> now, I thought it would be a nice idea to look back at almost 1000 posts on my sites. Today an overview of the year it all started: 1997.</p>

<p>Though I already had a personal web page for some years, I didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time on it. My main interests these days were <a href="http://www.jongnederland.nl/">Jong Nederland</a> and <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a>. In November I had a great weekend with all JN volunteers on a national level, and in December I joined a Fimcap meeting in Rome. Though the meeting was only a weekend, I spend the entire week in Italy.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/1997/11/nieuws/">November 9, 1997</a> I added a new section to my personal web site: a news page. The word <em>weblog</em> did not exist yet, but my news page (though updated manually in FrontPage) did have some aspects of modern day weblogs; it showed the entries in reverse chronological order, but did not allow for comments.</p>
<p>The first entries are written in Dutch, but as I got more foreign friends I changed my personal site to English. The old news however, always stayed in Dutch…</p>
<p>A lot have changed in those ten years. Not only in my life, but also the weblog. It went through several designs, three domains, two content management tools, and had both active periods and inactive periods.</p>
<p>As I had very few readers in the beginning (I still remember the day I had 10 visitors) I doubt there is anybody who have been following Brain Tags since those early days. It doesn't matter whether you read this blog recently or for a long time, I wouldn't have continued that long without my readers. So I would like to use the opportunity to thank you all!</p>
<p>The coming days I will look back in more detail on the pas ten years.</p>

         	<p>Two years ago, reflections were cool and something new. Reflections gave your web site or your application a crisp look.</p>

<p>Nowadays, even the big operating systems and television stations have reflections and thus reflections as a design element are outdated. I am surprised, even irritated, by the big number of startups still using reflections in their logo or their screendumps only to look &lsquo;cool&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Get over it. Reflections are soooo 2005.</p>

         	<p>I could simply write here that I am too busy to write on Brain Tags, but I guess it is more interesting for you to read what I am doing currently. So this is a short list of my most interesting current projects:</p>

<h2>New web site for <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a></h2>

<p>This is a project on which I have been working for a long time (not always as active as now) and which should have been finished a long time ago. I am now finishing off the new design, after which we can finally show the world the work we have been doing. Working on a graphical design is quite an adventure for a technical person like me. I can easily tell whether I like a design or not, but to make one yourself is a whole different thing.</p>

<h2>Renewed site for <a href="http://www.brytenet.com/">Brytenet</a></h2>

<p>Hopping along with the Fimcap redesign, I am also reworking the site where I station my side-business. Both sites are built on eZ Publish, so I use the experiences on ons site to advance on another. I am also working to leverage some of the karma I got with blogging to new profitable projects under the Brytenet umbrella. You will read more about that when these plans have crystallized a little bit more. Anyway, currently the Brytenet site is off-line while I restructure the content, but before next week I hope to be open for business again.</p>

<h2>A home project</h2>

<p>There is still one room in our house where we didn&rsquo;t do anything since we moved in, the room where our visitors sleep. Those who have visited us can confirm that the beds in that room have had their time. So we are going to use our holiday in November to get rid of the current furniture and paint the room. In the mean time we are already looking for two new beds and a wardrobe to provide our guests with better rest and ourselves with more storage room.</p>

<h2>Teaching sells</h2>

<p>And finally I started an on-line course about making on-line courses (?) called <a href="http://teachingsells.com/?ref=ebdbbfb9&amp;pid=c4a0577c">Teaching Sells</a>, which will probably help me getting all that information I have been absorbing over the past years out of my head and into my wallet. I am sure some very interesting new projects will arise from that course.</p>

<h2>Blogging</h2>

<p>The blogs are still there, and will stay, though I am considering stopping to write on the <a href="http://pos-wizard.com/">Wizard of POS</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: This post is my contribution to <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a>, joining thousands of other bloggers to write about one topic for a single day. This year's topic is the environment.</em></p>
<p>Camping is my favourite holiday activity. In our tent I feel free and I feel at home as I use my own stuff and sleep in my own sack. Furthermore, it is very easy for a shy person like me to have contact with others on a camping. I feel a lot more comfortable on a camping than in hotel and apartments.</p>
<p>However, lately I noticed a trend of people camping more and more luxury: huge caravans with satellite television, microwave ovens, washing machine, skottelbraai, and even a motor to move around on the camping. While I like some comfort, one of the things I like about camping is its simpleness: less things around you means less cleaning and less worrying and thus more relaxing. And it still is possible:</p>
<p>When I still lived in the Netherlands, I was a member of the <a href="http://kampeerclub.nl/">NTKC</a>, a club of people who love camping in a simple and quiet way. The NTKC owns 22 campings in natural areas, and all the maintenance and administration is done by club members. On the NTKC terrains, people camp with tents up to 1.90 meters high and always in natural colours. When staying for a longer period, members move their tent to prevent dead grass.</p>
<p>Most of the time there is plenty of room on the campings; in spring and autumn it might happen that you won't see anybody else from your tent!</p>
<p>For me, being in the middle of nature is a very relaxing experience. If you live in the Netherlands and enjoy camping and nature, be sure to check out the NTKC. There are similar organisations elsewhere, such as the <a href="http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/">Camping and Caravanning&nbsp; Club</a> in the U.K..</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/09/24/why-teenagers-dont.html">Why teenagers don&#39;t buy iPods</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/09/24/why-teenagers-dont.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-09-24 10:08:00 &#43;0100">Sep 24, 2007</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><img src="uploads/2021/4b480cd39d.png" width="171" height="240" alt="iPod" /></p>

<p>When I take my breakfast in the mornings, I usually sit in front of a window looking out to the entrance of a school. Some days ago I looked at some teenagers and noticed that all of them were listening to a MP3 player, but none of them had an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPod-Nano-Video-Silver%2Fdp%2FB000JO7PIM&tag=braintags-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">iPod</a>.</p>
<p>As the iPod is certainly the hippest and easiest to use MP3 player on the market, I assumed that at least some teenagers would have one, while others would settle for a cheaper model. The iPods is indeed more expensive than other players, but usually pricing is not that big problem for teenagers if the device is cool enough.</p>
<p>I decided to ask a teacher who also owns an iPod about his view on the subject, and he gave me a very simple explanation.</p>
<p><strong>The iPod is anti-social</strong>.</p>
<p>For teenagers, gadgets only have one function: communicating and sharing with friends. The first thing they do after downloading a song from internet is share it with their friends. And well, the iPod simply won't let them do that.</p>
<p>Songs on the iPod are locked up and are only accessible from iTunes on the original PC. Furthermore, to connect an iPod to a PC you need a cable and there is no way a teenagers is going to walk around with an un-sexy USB cable.</p>
<p>A for teenagers successful MP3 player has an incorporated USB port (usually hidden under a cap) so they can connect it easily to any PC (at school, at their friend's home,...) and it should simply work like a memory stick with the MP3 files accessible from the operating system for easy copying of files.</p>
<p>As you know, I am not a very social person, and therefore I am perfectly happy without an iPod.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When I started using the default templates coming with Movable Type 4, I missed the <strong>Recent Comments</strong> widget. Below I explain how you can add create this widget and ass it to your sidebar in true MT4 style.</p>

<p>In the Movable Type administrative interface, go to Design &gt; Templates &gt; Template Modules and open either the ‘Sidebar - 2 Column Layout’ or the ‘Sidebar - 3 Column Layout’ template module, depending on which one you are using. Scroll down until you find a line with `` and paste the following code just above that line (you can of course also choose another position for the recent comments widget):</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-archives widget&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&ldquo;widget-header&rdquo;&gt;Recent Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&ldquo;widget-content&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&ldquo;widget-list&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;li class=&ldquo;widget-list-item&rdquo;&gt;&lt;a href=&ldquo;#comment-&lt;br /&gt;&ldquo;&gt; on &lt;a&lt;br /&gt;href=&ldquo;&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>Now in any template where you want to show the recent comments (e.g. the main index template or the individual archive template) you add the following line: ``
Rebuild your weblog, and it should show you the five latest comments in the sidebar, just as you can see on this blog.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Widgets are the fastest and easiest way to configure your sidebar. Just open up the widget administrator and drag and drop widgets on the sidebar. A great feature for novice bloggers, who don&rsquo;t have the technical knowledge to tweak sidebar templates.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the default Movable Type templates don&rsquo;t use widgets, which means that to enable widgets on your site you will have to tweak the sidebar template… ouch!</p>

<p>I know, the default sidebar template offers a far more advanced features than the widget engine can offer, with variables and MTIf constructions. The default sidebar template is a lot cooler without widgets, but also very hard to tweak.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the default sidebar template should include a check on the number of widgets configured. If no widgets have been configured, it should show the fancy sidebar, but as soon as I configure widgets, it should hide the normal sidebar and show the widgets. This is also what many templates in WordPress do and gives you the both of two sides: a fancy sidebar for starters which is easily adaptable by weblog owners.</p>

<p>Spain is a country of bureaucracy and civil servants. Many people I speak to have only one dream: becoming a civil servant. Unlike most other modern countries, in Spain civil servants earn way more that people working in companies. Add to that some very good secondary labour conditions and a <strong>contract for life</strong> without performance objectives, and you can understand why most people working for companies envy those others.</p>
<p>Just an example: most teachers earn about 25% more than I do (and my wage is higher than the average company worker). For that money, they work 18–22 hours a week at the school, plus some hours at home for preparation and revision of exams, while I work 8,5 hours a day, five days a week. Furthermore, while I have four weeks of holidays, they get two whole months in summer, two weeks at christmas and another week at eastern!</p>
<p>Other civil servants might not have such a long holidays as the teachers, but they do enjoy other benefits. Knowing all this, I am still surprised whenever I see the huge economical growth Spain is making with such a big and inefficient civil overhead.</p>

         	<p>The past days two posts have been published on other blogs, based on my experience and knowledge available on <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

<p>Last Saturday, I wrote an entry on <a href="http://www.whatsthenextaction.com/">What&rsquo;s The Next Action</a> called <a href="http://www.whatsthenextaction.com/archive/2007/09/01/online_gtd_with_nozbe_and_goog/whats_the_next_action">On-line GTD with Nozbe and Google Calendar</a>, in which I explain how two on-line services can be used together as a complete productivity tool.</p>

<p>And yesterday my second guest post (which I wrote some weeks ago) was published on <a href="http://gtd.marvelz.com/">GTD Experiences</a>. The post is called <a href="http://gtd.marvelz.com/blog/2007/09/04/getting-gtd-done/">Getting GTD Done</a>, and gives nine tips that in my experience help when implementing the <strong>GTD</strong> method.

<p>Behind the screens, various big changes are happening on my blogging environment. As you see in the sidebar, I currently <del>maintain</del> have four weblogs.</p>
<p>The oldest of the four is <a href="http://braintags.com/">Brain Tags</a>, running since ages on Movable Type. Then I have a weblog called <b>The Wizard of POS</b>, until today running on the same MT installation as Brain Tags and available at ‘pos.braintags.com’. There is also an old blog about my web hosting adventures, which I haven't updated in ages, called <a href="http://brytenet.com/weblog">Brytenet weblog</a> and just as the rest of the Brytenet site managed with eZ Publish. And finally I have my successful Spanish productivity blog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> maganed with WordPress.</p>
<p>Quite a mess, isn't it? Add to that the fact that I have been experimenting a lot with non-public weblogs, and you'll get an idea of what things look like.</p>
<p>So I decided to clean things up, and do it well. You'll notice from the links in the side bar that I have presented my blogs as <strong>The Brain Network</strong>, a name I never have been satisfied with. Anyway, I acquired a new short and flashy domain name (of course hosted by <a href="http://brytenet.com/">Brytenet</a>) and made a fresh MT4 installation. This will be the home of <strong>Brain Tags</strong>, <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, <strong>El Canasto</strong> and a new network blog (I still have to decide whether I want to continue with the Brytenet Weblog).</p>
<p>Until now I have re-created <strong>The Wizard of POS</strong>, imported all existing entries, comments and trackbacks, and tweaked the default template. And by the way, I gave it its own domain name, <a href="http://pos-wizard.com/">pos-wizard.com</a>.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done (and I have little time), but I already feel good about the new <em>home</em> for my weblogs and am looking forward to being able to manage all my blogs from a single screen.</p>

         	<p>For everyone who has spent more than a holiday in Spain and for whom some of the following are true…</p>

<ol>
    <li>You think adding lemonade, fanta or even coke to red wine is perfectly acceptable. Especially at lunch time.</li>
    <li>You can't get over how early bars &amp; clubs shut back home —surely they're shutting just as you should be going out?</li>
    <li>You aren't just surprised that the plumber/decorator has turned up on time, you're surprised he turned up at all.</li>
    <li>You've been part of a <em>botellon</em>.</li>
    <li>You think it's fine to comment on everyone's appearance.</li>
    <li>Not giving every new acquaintance <em>dos besos</em> seems so rude.</li>
    <li>You're shocked by people getting their legs out at the first hint of sun — surely they should wait until at least late June?</li>
    <li>On MSN you sometimes type 'jajaja' instead of 'hahaha'.</li>
    <li>You think the precious <em>aceite</em> is a vital part of every meal. And don't
understand how anyone could think olive oil on toast is weird.</li>
    <li>You're amazed when TV ad breaks last less than half an hour, especially right before the end of films.</li>
    <li>You forget to say please when asking for things — you implied it in your tone of voice, right?</li>
    <li>You love the phenomenon of giving 'toques' — but hate explaining it in English</li>
    <li>You don't see sunflower seeds as a healthy snack — they're just what all the cool kids eat.</li>
    <li>You know what a <em>pijo</em> is and how to spot one.</li>
    <li>Every sentence you speak contains at least one of these words: <em>bueno</em>, <em>coño</em>, <em>vale</em>, <em>venga</em>, <em>pues nada</em>…</li>
    <li>You know what <em>resaca</em> means. And you had one at least once a week when you lived in Spain.</li>
    <li>You know how to eat <em>boquerones</em>.</li>
    <li>A bull's head on the wall of a bar isn't a talking point for you, it's just a part of the decor.</li>
    <li>You eat lunch after 2pm &amp; would never even think of having your evening meal before 9.</li>
    <li>You know that after 2pm there's no point in going shopping, you might
as well just have a siesta until 5 when the shops re-open.</li>
    <li>If anyone insults your mother, they better watch out…</li>
    <li>You know how to change a <em>bombona</em>. And if you don't, you were either lazy or lucky enough to live somewhere nice.</li>
    <li>You're either a <em>Los Serrano</em> person or an <em>Aquí no hay quien viva</em> person.</li>
    <li>You don't accept beer that's anything less than ice-cold</li>
    <li>The fact that all the male (or female) members of a family have the same first name doesn't surprise you.</li>
    <li>The sound of mopeds in the background is the soundtrack to your life.</li>
    <li>You know that the mullet didn't just happen in the 80s. It is alive and well in Spain.</li>
    <li>You know the difference between <em>cojones</em> and <em>cajones</em>, <em>tener calor</em> and
<em>estar caliente</em>, <em>bacalao</em> and <em>bakalao</em>… and maybe you learned the
differences the hard way!</li>
    <li>On a Sunday morning, you have breakfast before going to bed, not after you get up.</li>
    <li>You don't see anything wrong with having a couple of beers in the morning if you feel like it.</li>
    <li>Floors in bars are an ideal dumping ground for your <em>colillas</em>, <em>servilletas</em> etc. Why use a bin?!</li>
    <li>You see clapping as an art form, not just a way to express approval.</li>
    <li>You know <em>ensaladilla rusa</em> has nothing to do with Russia.</li>
    <li>When you burst out laughing every time you see a Mitsubishi Pajero</li>
    <li>You have friends named Jesus, Jose Maria, Maria Jose, Angel, maybe even Inmaculada Concepcion…</li>
    <li>When you can whistle at or applaud a <em>tia buena</em> and you get a wink instead of the middle finger.</li>

         	<p>Lately, especially since I use Twitter, I receive a lot of URLs in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> format. That made me think: if TinyURL gives out a unique URL each time it is used, when will they run out of URLs?</p>

<p>On their site they state that they have more than 42 million of them, which doesn&rsquo;t sound like an awful lot. All TinyURLs I receive have a six character identifier, such as <strong>3bso2z</strong>. A little calculation (six positions with 36 options per position) gives me 2.238.976.116 unique identifiers. More than two billion, that sounds already better. And if they run out of Ids, they can simply use seven or eight characters, which I still consider tiny. Eight positions give 2.984.555.162.628 (2 trillion!) unique identifiers!</p>

<p>It is clear: TinyURL is here to stay.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/08/24/static-versus-dynamic.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-08-24 16:11:44 &#43;0100">Aug 24, 2007</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Now that <strong>Movable Type 4</strong> has been released and leaped ahead of <strong>WordPress</strong>, the old discussion of static publishing versus dynamic publishing shows up again. Movable Type by default uses static publishing (it generates static HTML files with are served to the visitor) while WordPress uses dynamic publishing (all content is served directly from the database). What method is better?</p>

<p>As usual, the answer is: it depends…</p>

<p>Static publishing requires less server resources per visit, but it takes longer before updates (entries, comments and template changes) are visible. With dynamical publishing, your changes are immediately visible to your visitors, but you&rsquo;ll need more power to serve those pages.</p>

<p><strong>For most bloggers it won&rsquo;t make any difference</strong>, as they hardly tweak their templates and receive few comments and visitors. However, if you like tweaking your templates, you might want to go dynamic, and popular blogs are better off going static.</p>

<p>But wait, I can hear you think: <em>there are some very popular blogs using WordPress…</em> That&rsquo;s right, and without exception they use some kind of caching method to lower the server stress. On the other side, Movable Type can also run in dynamic mode (which is what I use for this blog), and you can specify for each template whether it should be served statically or dynamically, allowing you to optimize your site&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: for low-traffic sites, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you publish static or dynamic. If you have many visitors you probable want to use static or hybrid publishing.</p>

         	<p><img src="uploads/2021/56c01f80e3.png" width="200" height="150" alt="Watch" /></p>

<p>I just remembered that a little more than a year ago I took off my watch. The main reason was that my skin was irritated by the leather in the hot weather. And I knew that I didn't really need a watch, as I spend most of my days behind the PC with a little clock in the corner, and usually wear both my mobile phone and my Palm with me.</p>
<p>Now, after more than one year without wearing a watch, I don't miss it at all. Not only because I have clocks in other places, but most of all as time is not that important. While wearing a watch I found myself checking the time several times a day, while actually I only have four moments on the day on which I really need to know the time: the moment I have to wake up (taken care of by the alarm clock), the moment I leave the office for my lunch break (I will notice as my colleagues will leave too), the moment I go back to my office after lunch (which is after the weather forecast on TV finished) and the moment to go home after work (once again, I only have to follow my colleagues). For none of these moments I need a watch.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more useless watches appear. In fact, nowadays they only serve as a fashion accessory or in case you are out without a mobile phone. The watch has become a relic from the past.</p>

         	<p>The productivity guru of the moment, <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferriss</a>, writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere%2Fdp%2F0307353133%2F&amp;tag=braintags-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">his book</a> how he was able to reduce the amount of e-mail received by <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/03/22/how-to-check-e-mail-twice-a-day-or-once-every-10-days/">setting up an autoresponder</a> to tell that he only reads his e-mail once a day and that it is better to phone him for urgent matters.</p>

<p>I believe him, when he tells that this technique has reduced his e-mail load significantly. But what he doesn&rsquo;t tell is what happened to the number of telephone conversations he received. In my case, I notice a clear increase in telephone calls when I am very busy and cannot answer e-mails within the usual 12 hours. And guess what, when I am very busy, the last thing I am waiting for are telephone calls! When somebody phones me, that person decides what I will be doing for the next two minutes and when I will give attention to him (now!), while with e-mail I am the one deciding who should get my attention and when.</p>

<p>Tim&rsquo;s trick only works because his workload is very low. When you&rsquo;re workload is higher and you need to spend more time in the zone, it makes more sense to change your voice mail message to tell people that you can only be reached by phone during one hour a day and that they get faster response when they send their inquiry by e-mail.</p>

         	<p>For quite some time I have been happily using <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a>. For those who don&rsquo;t know this service: coComment basically keeps track of the comments you leave on web sites. If you&rsquo;re like me, reading and commenting on many sites, it can be difficult to track the replies to your comments. coComment captures your comment and tracks the conversations started by those comments on a single page instead of having to revisit all sites you&rsquo;ve commented on.</p>

<p>Yesterday coComment released a new version, bringing more <em>social</em> features. By doing that, they threw out the real value of their service: tracking conversations. The new page reserves 75% of screen real estate for groups, friends, favourites and neighbours, leaving just enough space for <strong>only five conversations</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/326eac8bb1.png" width="450" height="270" alt="coComment" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, all my conversations have been marked as unread, and I could not find an option to mark them all as read. This is not an upgrade, this is a downgrade!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Whenever I had an idea for a blog post, I used to create a new entry on that particular blog, jot down my idea, and save the post as a draft. As soon as I had more time, I checked the list with draft posts, chose a draft, and finished the post.</p>

<p>What had worked perfectly for a long time, lately became a burden. The problem is that over the time I have collected a great number of interesting themes to write about, resulting in a big amount of drafts. Some of those drafts only contain an URL, while other are more elaborated. In short, it became too difficult to find out quickly what was what.</p>

<p>So now I have changed my blogging workflow. I transferred all my ideas to <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">Google Notebook</a>, where they are nicely ordered per blog. On that page I can see all ideas with their actual content at a single page. One glance on my Notebook, and I can quickly decide what to write. Furthermore, with the Google Notebook Firefox extension I am able to select a text on a random web page and copy it together with the address of the page to my Notebook.</p>

<p>From now on, drafts in my blogging software are actually pieces I already have started to write, which usually are only a few. This set-up keeps things clear, and speeds up my blogging workflow.</p>

         	<p>Next week we&rsquo;ll be going camping in France. That means amongst others that we will be making quite some kilometres, and if you know me a little bit you know that I am not that fond of travelling large hours.</p>

<p>One way to make the trip more pleasant is music.</p>

<p>The traditional source of music was the radio, but when travelling long distances in several countries, you&rsquo;ll loose your station every two hours. The past years we brought some CDs with us, but CDs are bulky and we can only take a few of them.</p>

<p>For this year&rsquo;s trip, I bought a <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=257270#">Belkin TuneBase FM</a>, allowing us to listen to all the music stored on MJ&rsquo;s iPod.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/50c54197d6.png" width="172" height="250" alt="Belkin TuneBase FM" /></p>

<p>The TuneBase converts the iPod into a radio station. It has four button to select pre-stored frequencies and up and down buttons for manually selecting frequencies. All we have to do is tune our car radio to the TuneBase frequency, and we can listen to all the music stored on the iPod.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re ready for the trip!</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2007/06/19/movable-type.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-06-19 10:05:00 &#43;0100">Jun 19, 2007</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last week <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> released the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">beta for Movable Type version 4</a>. Until last weekend I didn&rsquo;t have the time to have a look at it, but Sunday I downloaded the files and copied them to my server.</p>

<p>Of course things went wrong, as was to be expected with a beta release. I know that you never should install beta releases on a production environment, but I took the risk anyway as this weblog is partly a playing ground. I am a long-time Movable Type user, and suspect that my database is full of legacy data of old settings and plugins.</p>

<p>After copying the files, I went to the new MT Dashboard, and found out that all images had been scrambled. I suspected that my FTP application accidentally had uploaded them in ASCII mode, so copied them again in binary mode, without result. I checked the files I had downloaded from Six Apart, and yes, they were scrambled as well. So I downloaded the <em>tar.gz</em> file instead of the <em>zip</em>, uploaded the images again, and the images came up correctly.</p>

<p>The second problem I encountered was more serious. The dashboard showed up OK, but whenever I tried to access one of the blogs, I got an error message:</p>

<p><code>invalid permissions for author 1 at lib/MT/Author.pm line 337</code></p>

<p>This one took a little bit more to solve, but at the end I found out that newly created users don&rsquo;t have this problem. After comparing all settings in the database between my old users and the new user, I found the culprit: In the table &lsquo;mt_permission&rsquo; I found duplicate record for my user ID with <code>permision_blog_id = 0</code>. After removing the duplicate records, the error did not appear any more.</p>

<p>Now I am able to get into my blogs, and as you see, write new items. However, as soon as I publish a new entry I get another error message: <code>Fallback Is Required At Lib/mt/util.pm Line 1331</code>. I haven&rsquo;t solved this error yet, but found out that I can simply rebuild my site to make the entry appear.</p>

<p>As you can see, I also changed the design of the site. I was getting fed up with the previous design, and at the same time wanted to see what new template features came with MT4, so I reset the templates to the new minimalist theme. The coming days I will be studying and tweaking this design to my own tastes, so things might change a little bit.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed already is that the default templates do not use the widget manager, basically because the new sidebar template module offers filtering by template type, giving the possibility to show a different sidebar on different types of pages.</p>

<p>Other things they copied from WordPress are Pages and a file manager (with tagging!!!).</p>

<p>There are still some other things to be fixed, such as activating trackbacks. In the blog&rsquo;s configuration I see that this has been deactivated on a system level, which is not the case. So far I like MT4 a lot. It is fast, pleasant looking and I am happy with new features such as the file manager, entry auto-save and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/2007/06/making_template_errors_not_suck.html">interactive template errors</a>.</p>

She told him, "tomorrow morning I expect to find a gift in the driveway that goes from 0 to 200 in under 6 seconds, AND IT BETTER BE THERE."
The next morning, Mark got up really early before work. When his wife woke up a couple of hours later, she looked out the window, and sure enough, there was a small gift-wrapped box sitting in the middle of the driveway.
Confused, the wife put on her robe, ran out to the driveway, and took the box into the house. She opened it, and found a brand new bathroom scale.
Mark is not yet well enough to have visitors ...

<p>After several tries, I finally found the culprit: my new FTP software tries to be &lsquo;smart&rsquo;, and figures out whether a file should be overwritten or not. After dumbing down the FTP software, all is fine again.</p>

         	<p>My latest weblog <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a> is a big success, with more and more readers every day.</p>

<p>Every week a few other weblogs link to articles from El Canasto and therefore I expected my PageRank to increase, but to my big surprise Google decided to lower the PageRank for El Canasto last week. It went from five down to four, and I have no idea why.</p>

<p>Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t care about it, but in this case El Canasto was about to enter in the <a href="http://top.blogs.es/">Top 500</a> of Spanish weblogs, and I expected an increase of visitors when arriving to that point, but the PageRank is one of the factors used to calculate popularity. The decrease in PageRank set me back to <a href="http://top.blogs.es/metrics/blog/el-canasto/">position 650</a>. I can only wait until I steadily grow again, or until Google makes another readjustment of the PageRank.</p>

         	<p>In order for a weblog to be successful, an author needs to write with personality. A weblog needs its own <strong>voice</strong>. And I have to be honest and admit that Brain Tags was missing a voice lately. I did post regulary, but most of the content was picked elsewhere and republished here.</p>

<p>But the voice is back! Of course I will still occasionally post a nice video, but will also start writing again about technology, travelling and my life in general. As a true <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr> adept, I added this commitment to my list of responsibilities (20.000 feet), and started thinking about some projects to undertake to blow new life in this site.</p>

<p>In November I will celebrate the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of my weblog, and will plan some extra activities here for all people who have followed me throughout the years.
Stay tuned!</p>

         	<p>Google finally opened up GMail for users in Canada and the USA, where this service was still invite only. The popular mail service remains in beta though.</p>
<p>This will probably also end one of the largest comment threads on Brain Tags (138 comments up to now), where visitors could request a <a href="/2007/02/14/gmail_open_for_everybody/">GMail invite</a>.</p>

<p>The release op <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a> is definitely the news of the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pipes is a hosted service that lets you remix feeds and create new data mashups in a visual programming environment. The name of the service pays tribute to Unix pipes, which let programmers do astonishingly clever things by making it easy to chain simple utilities together on the command line.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course I have tried out Pipes, and used it to create <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/6LNmLF_32xGc5sHKXqIxGw/">a consolidated feed of all my writings</a>.</p>
<p>Until now, I have two remarks about this service:</p>
<ol>
<li>I tried to sort my writings by publication date. It did sort them, but did not recognise the date format used in some feeds, starting with the weekday (Mon – Sun). Therefore, my writings made on Wednesdays ended up at the end of the list;</li>
<li>As there still are relatively few Pipes, it is easy to game the listing, which is sorted by the number of times a Pipe has been run. I simply clicked a few time on the <em>Run this Pipe</em> link, and little by little moved upwards in the list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Two minutes more clicking, and my <em>Brain Network</em> pipe ended up halfway on the second page, in front of some way more interesting feeds. Help me get to the front page by <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/6LNmLF_32xGc5sHKXqIxGw/">running my Pipe</a>!</p>

         	<p>If you buy a brand new PC with Windows Vista, you might find a big surprise when Vista does not look the same as the Vista in the showroom. After installing Vista, the so-called <em>Windows Experience Index</em> is calculated for your PC. Depending of the results of this test, certain features of Vista are enabled or disabled to give you the optimal performance.</p>

<p>This is great from a technical point of view, but makes it difficult to know exactly what you are buying. Only at home you will find your Experience index and see what has been disabled. And until now I haven&rsquo;t seen any hardware manufacturer publish the Windows Experience Index for the PC&rsquo;s they sell.</p>

         	<p>I am on the road again. Today I am traveling from Barcelona to Cyprus, spending over ten hours in airplanes and airports. No distractions, just me, so I could get a lot of job done. I carry a laptop computer, and already wrote some documents, I checked my e-mail and read all interesting news in Google Reader. I am in the ‘flow’, but will soon have to stop working. My laptop is running out of batteries, and I still have about half the trip to go. I searched in every corner of the airport, but haven&rsquo;t found a single power outlet!</p>

<p>Many travellers nowadays carry laptop computers and other electronic devices, and most of those devices need electricity. Batteries only serve for some hours, so power outlets in airports would be useful to many travellers. I can&rsquo;t imagine the number of productive hours lost each year in Milano alone! Please airports, give us power outlets.</p>

         	<p>A little bit more than one month ago, <a href="/2006/12/a-new-weblog/">I started a new weblog</a> called &lsquo;<a href="https://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>&rsquo; in which I write about <em>Getting Things Done</em> and personal productivity.</p>

<p>Until now I have written 28 posts meaning that I have been able to keep up with my initial schedule of at least one post every two days. I found it easy to find new material, and usually have about 10 posts in he pipeline.</p>

<p>The people have received the new blog very well. I have received 30 comments/trackbacks. Quite some bloggers have found my blog and have reposted or linked to my articles. The most popular post is <a href="https://canasto.es/2006/12/calendario-compacto/">my translation</a> of <a href="http://davidseah.com/archives/2006/12/14/compact-calendar-for-2007/">David Seah&rsquo;s compact calendar</a> for 2007 with 2850 unique views. At this moment I am receiving about 200-400 visitors per day.</p>

<p>So far it has been a very positive experience for me. Even though it costs me a little bit more time to write in Spanish, I enjoy using this language and already learned some more. Of course I tell my visitors that I am not a native speaker, and hope they are willing to forgive my errors.</p>

         	<p>Today I published the first entry on a new weblog: <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

<p>El Canasto is my first blog in Spanish and has been created for two reasons. The first reason is that I have found very little material in Spanish about <em>lifehacks</em> and <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a>, one of the topics I like to read about. There is clearly something missing in the Spanish weblog spectrum. The second reason is that I really want to improve my Spanish language skills, but don&rsquo;t have the discipline to sit down and study. However, writing about stuff I like might give me the drive to learn more.</p>

<p>To set up El Canasto I used WordPress and the minimalistic <a href="http://cutline.tubetorial.com/">Cutline</a> theme. I spent some days making sure every word in the template has been translated correctly into Spanish, and have many plans more for optimizing the look &amp; feel of this new site. But for the moment, it is more important to get rolling, so I published a first little entry. My plan is to maintain a higher posting frequency than on this blog or the <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">Wizard of POS</a> as I have much material and a lot of ideas for this blog.</p>

<p>For now I would like all my readers to have a look at <a href="http://canasto.es/">El Canasto</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/11/24/two-faces-of.html">Two faces of the Pareto Principle in business</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/11/24/two-faces-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-11-24 11:50:00 &#43;0100">Nov 24, 2006</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<blockquote>The <strong>Pareto principle</strong> (also known as the 80-20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity) states that for many phenomena, 80% of the consequences stem from 20% of the causes.
<em>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Wikipedia</a></em>

</blockquote>

<p>The Pareto principle was named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of income in Italy was received by 20% of the Italian population, but the same principle can be found in many other situations.</p>

<p>In most businesses, 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales. And technical departments know that 80% of the problems are caused by only 20% of the clients. This is very interesting information for managers, who can use these numbers to steer their sales and support departments.</p>

<p>But how can we correlate the Pareto numbers for these two departments? Are the 20% that purchase the most the same customers that use most of your organization&rsquo;s resources? Well, experience tells us that this is not the case: there usually are customers buying for huge amounts without ever needing the support department. The two Pareto principle are not correlated, so if we only look at the small group of customers responsible for 80% of the sales, you will find once again that 20% of that group is using 80% of the resources.</p>

<p>As there is no correlation, I can easily divide my customers into four distinct groups:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>
    <li>Clients generating 80% of the sales and using 80% of the resources;</li>
    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales, but using only 20% of the resources;</li>
    <li>Clients generating 20% of the sales and using 80% of the resources.</li>
</ol>

<p>I put those four groups in a specific order. The first group is worth the most, as they bring in a lot of money at low costs and the fourth group is the most difficult group.</p>

<p>So should you just drop the customers in the fourth group? Of course not, as we are talking about a principle and not a fixed categorization. If you drop group four, and look again at the numbers, you will see that once again 20% of the customers account for 80% of the sales and 80% of the resources are used by only 20% of the clients. Customers who were in to top 20% before, not rank lower simple because you have less customers. If I have 100 clients, there are 20 clients in the top 20%, but if I drop 50 of them, the top 20% will be formed by only 10 customers. Of course, if you have to drop customers, because you haven&rsquo;t got enough resources, make sure you drop clients from the fourth group, as the clients in the other three groups are worth more.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A while ago I tried out the new <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, and haven&rsquo;t looked back at my old <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/2005/12/rss-bandit/">RSSBandit</a> ever after. It ran very smoothly since the start, and I just love the &lsquo;River of News&rsquo; view.</p>

<p>But lately the experience has decreased. The last few days Google News feels slow, taking about 2-3 seconds to go from one article to the next one when I press the <em>J</em> key, which was also noticed by <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/13/too-fast-for-google-reader/">Robert Scoble</a>.</p>

<p>I also noticed that sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t load all my unread items as it did before; after reading about fifty articles, I reach the bottom, while there are still many unread items waiting for me to be read. This is not a big issue, as I can simply press the <em>R</em> to refresh.
The last days I noticed another glitch: <em>zombie articles</em>:</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/5ecd75266e.png" width="566" height="180" alt="Google reader telling me that there are no unread items, while there are 2 new articles" /></p>

<p>Google Reader tells me &lsquo;Your reading list has no unread items&rsquo;, while at the same time it shows that I have two unread articles from <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">tech.memeorandum</a>. For me, this is the most irritating glitch, as I have to leave my <em>River of News</em> to open the specific feed, change my setting to show all articles and go down the list to find the zombie.</p>

<p>Google Reader still is my preferred reader, and I hope they will solve these glitches soon.</p>

<p>More and more bloggers unite in so-called blogging networks. Robert Scoble published a good overview of the most important networks in <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/">Competitors of PodTech that I love, er, going to the Content Mall</a>. A content mall is the same as a blogging network.</p>
<p>As I am interested in blogging in general, I have been following various blogging networks for some time. I can clearly see the benefits of blogging networks for the bloggers involved, but have been wondering for a long time what the benefit is for the visitors of a site part of a blogging network. So I posted the following <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164130">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is clear that 'content malls' bring in huge benefits for the sites within a mall. They can work together and link to each other to boost PR.</p>
<p>But what benefit is there for the visitors? Shopping malls bring benefit by sharing a physical space with various stores. After going shopping for clothes I can buy some electronics without having to drive to another place. Very comfortable.</p>
<p>But when visiting a fashion weblog part of a content mall I can go to the technology weblog of that mall just as fast as I can go to any other techblog. I won't visit the technology weblog because it belongs to a certain group, but rather because I like it in spite of being part of that group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/10/competitors-of-podtech-that-i-love-er-going-to-the-content-mall/#comment-164224">Answered</a> promptly by Robert self:</p>
<blockquote><p>By joining a network a blogger/podcaster/videoblogger will probably be able to get paid much more than if he/she tries to do it on his/her own.</p>
<p>That money might let them quit their jobs (that's what happened to <a href="http://GeekBrief.TV">GeekBrief.TV</a>, for instance) which will enable that person to produce even more content for you. Or, maybe, afford better equipment. Or, maybe be able to afford a trip to more industry conferences where they'll be able to bring you more news and information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert completely hits the nail on its head here. What is good for the blogger is good for his/her reader.</p>

         	<p>Sometime, thing that have been in place for many years get in the way. In such cases, it is better to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Today, I said goodbye to the <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/2004/09/music-jukebox/">music jukebox</a> the place where for the past two years you could find tasty music. In this age of streaming music and video, there is no need any more to share MP3 files. Sites like <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> and <a href="http://pandora.com">pandora</a> are of greater help for discovering new music you like.</p>

<p>I also removed the <a href="http://jeroensangers.com">jeroensangers.com</a> site. Until now, that page showed an ugly photo of me (is it even possible to have a pretty photo at all?) and some links to my various sites. I am going to rethink the purpose of that site, which will probably contain more dynamic content. Until then, the site is in <em>stealth mode</em>.</p>

<p>Now, that feels a lot better!</p>

         	<p>Just like most other weblogs, this site has its ups and downs, and you might have noticed that it has been <em>down</em> lately. I am quite busy at the moment, working parallel at several projects.</p>

<p>The company I work for is preparing for the <a href="http://www.ifema.es/ferias/simo/default_i.html">SIMO</a> trade show in Madrid, where we will present the new versions of our products. Though I won&rsquo;t be present at the show (my responsibilities lie outside Spain) I do have a lot of extra work concerning translating and testing the new software.</p>

<p>Then I am working on the new <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a> web site. This weekend we are going to finish the forum functionality and start working on the design. We already did some brainstorming and I am happy that we are all more or less on the same line. Once the design is finished we will start using the first parts of the new site, and gradually transfer more functionality.</p>

<p>Once in a while I also work a little bit on <a href="http://brytenet.com/">BryteNet hosting</a>. Little by little the customers are coming in, but as everything is running smoothly and automated, I don&rsquo;t have much work on it.</p>

<p>And finally there is the blogging thing. I am planning on taking it more seriously, using Brain Tags for playing around, and doing the real blogging at <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">The Wizard of POS</a>. I am rethinking my work flow to crank up the posting frequency &ndash;now once a week&ndash; and have a more diverse range of articles. Furthermore I am working on a new weblog in Spanish about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=braintags-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F8495787164%2F"><abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>You see, I have plenty of work, so I better stop writing and get something done!</p>

<p>The campaign for the upcoming Catalan parliament elections officially started last Sunday. Main opposition party <a href="http://ciu.cat/">CIU</a> started in a very American way by including a one hour DVD called <strong>ConfidencialCAT</strong> criticizing the current government with any Catalan newspaper.<br>
I was shocked.</p>
<p>Not because of the movie, which I haven't seen yet, as in the past three years CIU has done nothing else than criticizing and whining. No, I was shocked because all newspapers co-operated. Every single newspaper in this country got blinded by flash of sensationalism and opted to distribute plain propaganda. Last Sunday, the newspapers of Catalonia lost their independence and transformed themselves into propaganda vehicles.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Everybody who knows me a little bit will admit it: I am a lazy person. Because I am so lazy I work in the IT industry, dreaming about automating all those boring tasks. Of course, automating tasks is hard work, but I don&rsquo;t want to think about that.</p>

<p>One of the problems I wanted to automate for a very long time is making backups of my PC. I know that it is very important to backup my files, and usually after tweaking my backup system I backup every X days. But after a while I loose interest, and days become weeks, and weeks become months,…</p>

<p>Media choice is another problem with backups, as the amount of data I have is growing exponentially. Back in the MS-DOS days, all important data fitted on e few floppy disks. As I started my studies and got involved in <a href="http://jnharmelen.nl/">Jong Nederland</a> I produced more documents and changed to ZIP disks for my backup. When I started ripping MP3 files, I was forced to change to CD&rsquo;s and DVD&rsquo;s. And now that I am creating my own video&rsquo;s I need even more than that. I thought about buying a USB hard disk, but the thought of spending a lot of money for a medium that will be outdated within two years kept me from going to the store.</p>

<p>And then I found <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/raf/signup.aspx?RAFUserUID=10773">Carbonite Online Backup</a>. Carbonite is a little application that will <strong>automatically</strong> backup my files to a server on the internet, without any user interaction. The best part of Carbonite is its price: $5 per month for <strong>unlimited</strong> storage!!! So for only $5 per month I can sit back and relax, knowing that my files are safe, and I won&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of space in the future.</p>

<p>I quickly downloaded and installed the demo version (15 days free), which promptly began to upload data. Now there was a little problem, as our broadband connection is ADSL, and the A stands for Asynchronous meaning that you can download at high speeds, but have less bandwidth available for uploading. It took me two days to get all my files to the Carbonite server.</p>

<p>When checking what files were present on the Carbonite server, I noticed that there was a lot of crap. In the installation procedure, I had selected that I wanted to backup <em>My Documents</em> and the <em>Desktop</em>, which Carbonite had interpreted as being the whole <em>Documents and settings</em> folder, including cached files, etc. I tweaked the settings a little bit, and was able to reduce the backed up volume by one third. I also added some other files such as my ActiveWords database and my Trillian preferences (both installed under <em>Program Files</em>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got the whole system up and running for some weeks now, and am very happy with it. My backups are always up-to-date and I don&rsquo;t have to think about copying files anymore.</p>

<p>The only problem I have found is my mailbox. As I typically have e-mail open during the whole day, the inbox file changes continuously. Besides that, the file is rather big, taking a while to upload. The result is that this particular file is hardly ever backed up. I am still looking for a solution, possibly using another tool to create a local copy and adding this copy to Carbonite.</p>

<p>In short: Carbonite is a very good product giving great value for its money.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://www.calpaller.com/">Cal Paller</a> is a lovely little cottage (<span xml:lang="es">Casa Rural</span>) in the mountains near La Seu d&rsquo;Urgell. We had the pleasure to spend three days in one of the six available rooms, and have enjoyed it a lot. Cal Paller is the perfect starting point for mountain walks, mushroom &lsquo;hunting&rsquo;, horseback riding or skiing (winter only of course).</p>

<p>We found Cal paller a very special place. The location is fantastic and the 18th century mansion has been restored with great care of detail. There are many little corners where you can sit down and relax. Eva and Pep, the owners of the place, are very caring and the food Eva prepared us for supper was absolutely fabulous.</p>

<p>I have uploaded some photo&rsquo;s we made during the weekend, so everybody can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/sets/72157594312592959/">see what a fantastic place Cal Paller is</a>.</p>

         	<p>For me the holiday period is not only a period for relaxing, but also a period of reflection. I never make any <em>January 1st</em> changes to my habits, but usually do so in August or September.</p>

<p>For a while I have been thinking about doing more sports, as most days my physical exercise is limited to the daily walk to the garage to pick up the car. We do occasionally walk in the mountains, but that&rsquo;s not enough. I have been thinking about it for a long time but never found the activity that suited me. My working hours make it difficult to commit to team sports and I don&rsquo;t like the gym as I prefer something in the open air.</p>

<p>This summer it finally occurred me: inline skating could me my thing. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed ice skating in the Netherlands, and like the freedom of making little tours around my hometown. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. Right after coming home I bought myself some <a href="http://www.rollerblade.com/">Rollerblades</a>, the Geo II model, and downloaded some braking instructions as I knew that I&rsquo;d had to learn different breaking techniques that I used on ice.</p>

<p>This week I went out skating two times on an empty parking lot. The coming weeks I will go back there to practice my breaking skills before I hit the streets. And you know what the best thing is? I already feel good about myself!</p>

         	<p>Though weblogs are the perfect example of <strong>periodical publications</strong>, in many countries they are not liable for <abbr title="International Standard Serial Number">ISSN</abbr> codes.

         	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> launched a new affiliate tool this week called aStore. This tool allows you to create your own themed Amazon store and embed the store on your web site. The tool is very easy to use and allows you to create a site complete with product reviews and full product descriptions. They have even added some widgets that automatically display lists and similar items. There have always been ways to display lots of Amazon content on your web site, but this is a much more robust and easy to implement option.</p>
<p>Of course I could not resist playing around with it, so I created my own little store and filled it with products related to <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen</a>'s <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> productivity methodology: books, labelers, moleskine notebooks, PDA's…</p>

         	<p>One more week to go until the start of our holidays. Yes, we go when everybody else already forgot about their holidays.</p>

<p>Our plans are simple: we are going to spend one week in the Netherlands, and two weeks in Andalusia. We&rsquo;ve tried to visit my family before, but the flights were simply too expensive in the high season. So we decided to use part of our holidays to visit my family and our friends. As we have plenty of time, we will go up by car, saving a few bucks along the way.</p>

<p>After that we plan to spend some days at home to pick up our tent, and drive further down to Andalusia. In the almost five years that I live here, I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of Spain besides Catalonia. Of course there is plenty to see over here, but I feel a little bit ashamed of my lack of knowledge about the other parts of this country. The two weeks we will be spend in the south will be a little start in getting to know more of Spain.</p>

         	<p>I joined the <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense program</a> before I started using <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/">GMail</a>. As a result of this, I have to logins for Google&rsquo;s services: the old e-mail for AdSense and my Gmail account for using all other Google service.</p>

<p>I was fed-up with this situation, so I decided to look at the AdSense help pages for instruction on how to combine my two accounts. I found the following:</p>

<blockquote>Right now, it isn't possible for AdSense publishers to update their email address directly from within their account. If you require an update of the email address associated with your AdSense account, please follow the instructions below to help us assist you.

<ol>
    <li>
Draft a new email. If possible, please use the email address currently associated with your AdSense account
</li>
    <li>Write 'Login change request' as the subject of your message
</li>
    <li>
Please include all of the following in the body of your message:

    <li>The number of page impressions registered on your first day of impressions
</li>
    <li>Send this email to adsense-support@google.com
</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>I collected all the necessary information, and requested a change to my Gmail account. This was their reply:</p>

<blockquote>Unfortunately, I'm not able to update your AdSense login to a Google Account or a Gmail address because our system doesn't support this type of change at the moment. I sincerely apologize for the trouble this causes you, and I thank you for bearing with us as we work hard to extend this option to AdSense publishers in the future.<br /><br />

I can, however, update your AdSense login to a non-Gmail address if you prefer. You can simply reply to this email, providing the desired email address in the body of your response, and I'll take care of your request as soon as I'm able.

</blockquote>

<p>WTF?! Google does not have the possibility to merge accounts???? If I sign up with Yahoo! I can use that e-mail account for AdWords, but I can&rsquo;t use a GMail account? Great way to send customers to the competition! They&rsquo;ve got some work to do then, since all those acquisitions they make will only bring more people like me with double accounts. It cannot be <em>that</em> hard, right?</p>

<p>Yes, the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/podcast/">43 Folders podcast</a> is my favourite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" title="Wikipedia info about Podcast">podcast</a>. There are a few reasons why I consider it my favourite. Besides the obvious reasons such as &ldquo;Merlin Mann is a geek like me&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am obsessed with productivity tools&rdquo; there is another difference between the 43 Folders podcast and 99% of all the other podcasts out there.</p>

<p>Most people listen to podcasts during their daily commute. Modern society forces people to spend a ridiculous amount of time travelling, and there are very few things you can do while driving a car. Most commuters listen to music or the radio, but that is a very unproductive activity. If you want to spend your car-time productively, you only have two options: audio-based learning and listening to podcasts. Long commutes are the perfect place for listening podcast, and most podcasters target their show to this group. The result is that most podcasts are either 30 minutes long or 60 minutes long, so listeners have handy building blocks to fill their car time. 30 minutes also gives the podcasters the possibility to add decoration such as jingles and music to their show, making podcasting more entertaining, but less productive.</p>

<p>My commute usually takes less than 10 minutes, so it makes no sense for me to listen to podcasts in the car. I listen to podcasts during my breakfast instead. I only take a sandwich and a coffee for breakfast, so the maximum podcast length is about 15 minutes. I searched around (why do none of the podcast directories have an advanced search feature where I can filter for podcast length?) and found only very few short podcasts. And out of this very few podcasts that fit my needs, 43 folders is my favourite.</p>

         	<p>I am happy to say that I rarely receive spam. But today a message slipped though my defence lines using a tactic I did not see before: they sent me a simple, innocent message with a Word file attached.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/9f59670b64.png" width="491" height="151" alt="" /></p>

<p>In my curiosity I opened the <code>invoice.doc</code> attachment, and was greeted with &ldquo;Back2School Software&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Apparently the current generation of spam filters has gotten to the level where the only spam getting through are unreadable V1^Gr^ messages, and they are desperately looking for new ways to get their message across. Though probably many people that otherwise would read the e-mail won&rsquo;t open the Word document, the possibilities to create a readable message makes this a viable spam method. As far as I know, few spam filters look at the contents of attachments, but that is about to change.</p>

<p>At the moment the spammers are once again one step beyond the filters…</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/08/08/personal-finance.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-08-08 12:02:00 &#43;0100">Aug 8, 2006</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<blockquote><strong>Personal finance</strong> is the application of the principles of finance to the monetary decisions of an individual or family unit.

</blockquote>

<p>I have a love/hate relationship with personal finance. Ever since I have a computer I have been trying to get a grip on finances, with changing results.</p>

<h2>The excel days</h2>

<p>My first attempt used the example Excel sheet created by the <abbr title="Nationaal Instituut voor Budgetvoorlichting">Nibud</abbr> that came with Microsoft Excel. It was a nice and clever Excel sheet, but still living with my parents I only used part of it. After a while I stopped entering my receipts, and out went the Excel sheet.</p>

<h2>Hacking in Access</h2>

<p>A little bit later I started playing with Microsoft Access. Access also comes with a financial example file, and I modified and tweaked it to fit my needs. But after all the hacking, all left to be done was entering receipts and numbers, which is a boring job. I guess I still didn&rsquo;t need personal finance, as I left the database alone after some months.</p>

<h2>Banking software</h2>

<p>Some time later, a new phenomenon showed up: internet banking. My bank sent me some diskettes with an application that was able to import bank statements. Now that was easy! At first I tried to manage cash money with that application as well, but soon left that again. Internet banking was a success, as I have managed my bank accounts through that application until I could access my accounts through web pages. When later I started buying and selling stocks and stock options I could do that from the same application. That little application gave an overview of my bank accounts, but I still haven&rsquo;t been able to see where the money was going…</p>

<h2>Back to basics</h2>

<p>The situation complicated when I started living together. I was not dealing with my money anymore, it was <em>our</em> money. After some months the question came up: &ldquo;Where does our money go?&rdquo; We talked about it, and decided to implement a low-tech financial planning solution: pen &amp; paper. This worked great for some months, until we had more or less a picture of our expenses. Exit pen &amp; paper.</p>

<h2>Excel round two</h2>

<p>Last year we were planning some big expenses, and I wanted to know whether these were justified, and how much time we would need to recover the invested money. Right about that time I read about an easy budgeting template in Excel, <a href="http://pearbudget.com/">Pear Budget</a>. I downloaded it, sat down half an hour to fix the categories and the budgets, and have used it ever after. It is easy and fast to maintain, gives a good overview of our spendings. However, lately I had the feeling that I wanted more. Pear Budget shows me where the money is coming from and where it is going, but does not show what we have, and what we are expecting to have in the future. Besides that I wanted to make some changes in the categories I had set up last year, and that would mess up all past numbers.</p>

<h2>The current solution</h2>

<p>So I started to look around for a more complete solution, that could offer me budgeting, but also import bank statements, manage investments, work in several currencies, schedule payments, …</p>

<p>I thought a moment about searching for a Web 2.0 solution, but quickly let go that idea as I wouldn&rsquo;t trust such a personal information to anybody. I looked at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx">Microsoft Money Premium</a>, but that seems a very US centred product, and is overly complex; I do not need my personal finance application to do tax statements.</p>

<p>After a little but more of searching, I found <a href="http://www.mechcad.net/products/acemoney/">AceMoney</a>, a cheap but very complete solution that seems to fit my current needs. The user interface is not as shiny as MS Money, but it certainly does the job. Furthermore, AceMoney has been translated into many languages and even loads the local list of banks and categories.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/08/07/tags-technorati-vs.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-08-07 15:32:52 &#43;0100">Aug 7, 2006</time></a>

         	<p>As of version 3.31, <a href="http://sixapart.com/movabletype/">Movable Type</a> natively supports tags.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tags">Tags</a> are keywords or descriptive terms associated with an item as means of classification. Unlike categories, an item can have many tags to describe the item in several ways. Tags are well known from other (web) applications such as <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brainpics/">Flickr</a> for tagging photos and <a href="http://del.icio.us/beltza">del.icio.us</a> for tagging links.</p>

<p>The well known weblog search service <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> introduced tags to weblog entries, and allows for browsing and searching texts on weblogs by tag. Blog entries can be tagged easily by simply placing a few links at the bottom of the entry in <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">the right format</a>:
<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%5Btagname%5D" rel="tag">[tagname]</a></p>

<p>Now that <abbr title="Movable Type">MT</abbr> also supports tags, I hoped for a fluent integration with Technorati. Even though the default MT templates do not link the tags shown on the pages to Technorati but rather to an internal tags search on the current weblog, I hoped for a standard implementation in the RSS feed templates spidered by Technorati. And indeed I found a correct looking code:</p>

<p>Technorati automatically converts categories in the RSS feed to tags, and even though MT defines a new namespace, it should work correctly… But unfortunately, the above code does not add the tag called &ldquo;technorati&rdquo; to the item, but rather the record number &ldquo;31&rdquo;.
When I tried to look up the specification at <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag">http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag</a>, I received a 404, so I still don&rsquo;t know whether Six Apart made a mistake when developing the new feed template or whether Technorati should have parsed the feed. Does anybody know whether either Six Apart of Technorati are working on this issue?</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/08/03/handling-quotes-is.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-08-03 10:06:00 &#43;0100">Aug 3, 2006</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the biggest problems in scripting and programming is escaping quotes. Quotes have a special meaning, they are usually used for specifying the start and end of a string, such as in <code><code>&lt;abbr title=&quot;eXtensible Markup Language&quot;&gt;</code></code>. But what happens when the string between the quotes also contains quotes? …Errors!</p>

<p>There are several ways to prevent this situation. The two most common solutions are escaping the quotes by placing a special symbol in front of it such as <code>\&rdquo;</code> and replacing the quote by its character entity reference <code>&quote;</code>.</p>

<p>Why am I telling this? Well, this morning I was looking at <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>&rsquo;s Favorites function, and noticed that something went wrong. When adding a site to your favorites, you have the posibility to attach tags to that site. The instructions for adding tags are clear:</p>

<blockquote>Separate tags with spaces: cooking indian recipes. To join words use double quotes: "san francisco".</blockquote>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t work that way! When I tried to add &ldquo;point of sale&rdquo; as a tag<br />
<img src="uploads/2021/4af2c567c8.png" width="422" height="160" alt="Technorati tags" /></p>

<p>The following happened:<br />
<img src="uploads/2021/88f51e0cd2.png" width="419" height="154" alt="Technorati tags" /></p>

<p>Technorati obviously tried to solve the quoting problem by replacing the quotes, but this change has a nasty side effect. Of course I have contacted Technorati about this issue, and will update this post when they reply.</p>

         	<p>Only a week after <a href="http://braintags.com/2006/07/the-end-of-brain-links/">I closed down Brain Links</a>, Brain Links is back, albeit in a more simpler form. Before, each link had its own page, with a description and the possibility to comment on the link (which was rarely used). The new Brain Links is only visible as a linkroll on the sidebar of the main page of Brain Tags.</p>

<p>To power Brain Links, I no longer use Movable Type, but created a new widget that fetches the last ten links from <a href="http://del.icio.us/beltza">my del.icio.us account</a>. There are no archives, no overview, no categories, no comments,… just ten interesting links.</p>

<p>In case somebody also wants to create a del.ico.us widget, this is the code I used:</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class=&ldquo;module-delicious module&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&ldquo;module-header&rdquo;&gt;Brain Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&ldquo;module-content&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://del.icio.us/beltza&quot;&gt;my">http://del.icio.us/beltza&quot;&gt;my</a> del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>Insert the code above into a new system template called <strong>Widget: del.icio.us linkroll</strong>, and add the widget to a widget manager. Do not forget to replace <em>beltza</em> with the name of your del.icio.us account!</p>

<p><blockquote><p>When its latest stand-alone browser ships in Q4, Microsoft plans to use its patch-distribution mechanism as its primary delivery vehicle. But businesses will be able to control distribution via a Microsoft-provided blocking tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though a new version of the most popular web browser is definitely needed (the rendering engine is more than 6 years old, and there are many security problems) I wonder whether it is a good iedea to push it through the throat of so many people. This is going to lead to a lot of problems.</p>
<p>I am not afraid of websites that suddenly don&rsquo;t look so nice as before or that even stop working. The webmasters of such sites already had the chance to improve that ever since Firefox became popular, and if they still haven&rsquo;t updated their sites they will soon enough as visitors start complaining.</p>
<p>No, the main problem lies in the tight integration with the operating system, and the many third-party applications that make use of IE functionality. Though websites can be updated on a single place to fix the problem for once and ever, this is a lot harder for applications installed on millions of PC&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A few months ago we have found that some of our applications are incompattible with IE7, giving an ‘Invalid URL format’ error. We quietly started looking for a solution for this problem, expecting that IE7 would be released together with Windows Vista or as an optional download. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/26/678149.aspx">announcement </a> that Microsoft is going to push IE7 as an automatic update surely is going to give us some problems, as we are going to have to solve this bug and update all our customers before the end of Q3!</p></p>

         	<p>After the succesful redesign of <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">The Wizard of POS</a>, I had gathered some momentum, and continued with the redesign of Brain Tags.</p>

<p>First of all, I reverted back to the basic Movable Type templates, as I had hacked the old templates to a level that made it very difficult to maintain and update. Actually, the latest update to version 3.31 broke my site at several parts.</p>

<p>When all templates were more or lass back to basic, I used the fantastic StyleCatcher plugin to change the look and feel. I selected a style called <a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/designs/make_my_way">Make my way</a> from the Movable Type style contest. I know it is not very original, as there mioght be dozens of other blogs using the same style, but it is far better than I ever could make.</p>

<p>This is where it stands now. I still have some minor issues to fix, which will probably be done next week. What do you think about the new Brain Tags?</p>

         	<p>Since June 2004 I have posted 953 links to interesting, new and funny sites in the Brain Links section of this site. Today I have decided that I will stop adding more links.</p>

<p>I noticed the last months that little by little I am adding less links, and I started to wonder why. I started collecting the Brain Links as a reference site for myself; a place where I could look up those handy sites I saw a month ago. But the reality is that nowadays I hardly look back at all those links. It has literally become a link dump, a black hole for interesting stuff. I guess that subconciously I already figured out that it is not worth the effort anymore.</p>

<p>So exit to Brain Links. Soon I will start remodelling the Brain Tags site, just as I have done with <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">The Wizard of POS</a>, which will probably result in a leaner site that is easier to maintain and update. At that point, the Brain Links will probably disappear completely, though I know that you should not break links..</p>

<p>It has been very quiet on this site, and that usually means that I am working on something. And indeed, I am working on the new site for <a href="http://fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a>.</p>

<p>Besides that, the temperature in Lleida, almost reaching 40 °, makes that I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time behind the PC, but rather stay in the water of the swimming pool. As you might be worried what is going on here, I deceided to write a little bit about the new fimcap site.</p>

<p>We decided to implement the new site using the eZ Publish CMS, which allows for multi-lingual content and custom defined content types. This flexibility of course has a price: a steep learning curve. The basics are quite simple, but problems start when you want to modify templates. You literally can control everything, but you have to find the right template. Each page is made up from dozens of little templates, each of which can reside in several places.</p>

<p>Let me explain that in more detail. If you do a fresh installation, your site is configured to use two sets of templates: <em>standard</em>, which contains some bare-bones unstyled templates that make sure eZ Publish outputs at least something, and <em>base</em>, which adds a little bit of style. Of course, for your own site you want to use your own design, and you can either replace the <em>base</em> design, or add your own design, which is what we did. Now every time a template is called, eZ Publish first looks in the Fimcap design. If it can&rsquo;t find a template, it will search in the <em>base</em> design, and finally it will fall back to the <em>standard</em> design. So if I want to modify a template, I have to search in that order as well to find the currently used template. After a working for some weeks with the template system, I finally got the hang of it, and am able to find the correct templates quickly…</p>

<p>Our old APS camera has become useless now that we <a href="/2006/04/pentax_a10/">have a brand-new digital camera</a>. It has been lying in a drawer for some weeks now, and I know that I will never use it again. So I decided to sell it before it becomes completely unvaluable.</p>

<p>If you are interested in this camera, you can bid on it <a href="http://cgi.ebay.es/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=7627797153">on eBay</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After reading the lifehacker <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/how-i-work/">How I work</a> series, I thought that it might be interesting to write down my own way of working for the readers of Brain Tags.</p>
<h2>What desktop software do you use every day?</h2>
<p>As most people I have two sites from where I work: in the office I sell and support the products of <a href="http://www.ICG.es/">ICG software</a>, and at home I run <a href="http://brytenet.com/">BryteNet</a>, do some web development, blog and keep in contact with me friends all over the world. At both places I use a Windows XP desktop PC, equipped with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a></strong> I use the Internet a lot, and have always have some tabs open with sites I want to read whenever I have a spare moment, e.g. when I am on hold. With Internet Explorer I would have my task bar cluttered with screens, but Firefox's tabs keep things organized.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.activewords.com/">ActiveWords</a></strong> Whenever I have to work on a PC without ActiveWords I feel very clumsy. ActiveWords automatically corrects my typing errors, opens my applications, fills in texts and generally saves me a lot of time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a></strong> With customers and friends all over the world I use instant messaging all the time. The problem is that everybody uses another application, and the different applications (MSN, ICQ, AOL, Yahoo!, Google Chat,…) do not talk together. Instead of installing a separate client for each protocol, I use Trillian, which 'speaks' all those protocols.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://skype.com/">Skype</a></strong> Instead of sending messages, it is more efficient to actually talk to somebody. That is where Skype comes in, as I can talk with any other Skype user for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In the office:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> We are a Microsoft shop, so obviously use Outlook. Most of my colleagues use it exclusively for e-mail, but I spend more time in the calendar and tasks. Of course I had to make some adjustments, as the Microsoft way of doing things does not always coincide with my own. So I installed <a href="http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/">Outlook Quotefix</a> to stop Outlook from top-posting when I reply to messages and to trim the headers in my replies. Furthermore I use the <a href="http://gtdsupport.netcentrics.com/learn/">Getting Things Done add-in</a> to streamline my workflow and the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download&trk=ftr_ol">LinkedIn toolbar</a> to create contacts directly from people's signatures and to keep them updated when contacts change their <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sangers">LinkedIn profile</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/desktopsearch/enterprise/default.mspx">Windows Enterprise Desktop Search</a></strong> We have a lot of information scattered over a few places on several servers and of course on my own PC. Windows Desktop Search brings that all together, as I have it index all items in Outlook (mail, tasks, notes, contacts), and all documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML and PDF) on my PC and the servers. I use the enterprise edition as it has a much cleaner interface than the MSN edition.</li>
<li><strong>ICG Software</strong> Of course we have our own applications installed. Not only for giving support, but also for invoicing and tracking customer activity (CRM).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.unyte.net/">Unyte</a></strong> Unyte is a free add-on for Skype that allows you to share an application on your PC with the person(s) on Skype. I use it to give demonstrations, training and support to our foreign customers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>At home:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a></strong> My e-mail client of choice. It is fast and complete. Of course I use the IMAP protocol instead of POP3, so I always have all my important messages on the mail server to be accessed through webmail.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.palm.com/us/software/desktop/">Palm Desktop</a></strong> At home I don't need an advanced planner, so this simple (and free!) calendar, task list and contact list fulfills all my needs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a></strong> Blogging made easy. A real blogger does not write in small <code>textarea</code> fields, but uses a full blown desktop client.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/">HTML-Kit</a></strong> I used to do my coding work in notepad, but noticed that I needed some more features. Since then I use HTML-Kit to do all my coding.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS-Bandit</a></strong> To stay up-to-date with what is happening in the world I follow the writings on several web sites. Instead of visiting these sites every day, A read their feeds in RSS-Bandit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What web sites do you use every day?</h2>
<p>Just in terms of raw weekly hours, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is definitely number one. In addition to regular old searching, I use it for looking up definitions, as a calculator, and for checking stuff like maps and weather. I do love the Google.</p>
<p>Furthermore I use <a href="http://getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> to track my worked hours.</p>
<p>All other sites enter in RSS-Bandit, which is my dashboard to the world. It shows me tech news, news about my friends, search results on topics I am interested in, comments made on my weblogs, replies to comments I have left on other blogs…</p>
<h2>What PDA/personal organizer/system do you use to keep organized?</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/07/palmone_zire_31/">Palm Zire 31</a>, which I keep synchronized with my two workstations. I always have all information at hand, whereever I go.</p>

         	<p>FC Barcelona is champion of the <span xml:lang="es">‘Liga</span>’. If you know me only a little bit, you know that I couldn&rsquo;t care less, right? I only like sports the moment I practice it myself, but do not care about what others are doing. I like playing soccer with friends, though I am a terrible player, but get really bored when looking soccer on the television, to the point that I usually fall asleep.</p>

<p>But when FC Barcelona is involved, I have no choice. Living ‘only’ 160 kilometers from Barcelona means that Barça is part of daily life. It is as simple as that, and there is no way around it! Each and every day they appear on the TV news, whether they are preparing for a big match or simply because the players went for a walk.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening hell broke loose in Lleida. After the match everybody went out on the streets to celebrate the victory. There were fireworks, drums, people shouting and singing, but most of all car horns. The streets in the center had collapsed of all the cars driving around like crazy with Barça flags out of the windows.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind what Barça does, but I always appreciate a good party!</p>

That whole safety thing you have to suffer through every time? He turned it into a comedy routine: “Please pretend to pay attention while we explain the safety features of this Boeing 737. I know, I can't believe it either, but there's a safety card in the seat pocket in front of you. No one ever reads it, so I'm not going to even bother asking you to. At this time, you should have your seatbelts on, your tray tables up, and your seats in their upright and most uncomfortable position. This is a no complaining, no whining, no smoking flight. If you absolutely must smoke, I suggest you avail yourself of our smoking area out on the wing...that is, if you can manage to get it lit. While you're out there, feel free to enjoy our inflight movie, Gone With The Wind. We don't expect a loss of cabin pressure today. If we did, the three of us would have called in sick. But if we do lose pressure, masks will automatically fall from the ceiling. After you're done screaming, simply put the mask on and breath normally, like this: [Darth Vader Imitation]. Please put your own mask on before helping your children...or those who are acting like children, such as your husband. Now, since we've been cleared for take-off, I'd like to ask you to lean over and please press your face against the window so that all those other bankrupt airlines can see that we have a full flight. Neener, neener! And thank you for flying Southwest today. Remember, no one loves you, or your money more than Southwest!"

<p>When we were close to Andorra this weekend, we hopped over the border to do some shopping. We were looking for a new digital camera, and finally bought the Pentax A10. Of all cameras that matched our requirements, small form factor, minimal 3x optical zoom, quality optics system, the Pentax was the only one offering a usefull additional feature: stabilisation. The problem with small cameras is that it is very difficult to hold it steady, especially when using the zoom function. Stabilisation makes sure that pictures are still sharp under these conditions.</p>

<p>The coming days I will try out our new camera, so you might expect some changes on my photo page again.</p>

<p>After having our own stand on the <a href="http://www.CeBIT.de/">CeBIT</a> for two years, we have decided not to go this year. The reasons are the high cost of stand space, the length of the show and the decreasing number of business visitors. Though I always liked going to the CeBIT, this decision saves me a lot of time, as I don't have to prepare the stand, and will stay at the office during the two weeks that I normally need for the CeBIT. One of the things I will be doing during these weeks is contacting visitors of our stand during the previous years and polling their interest in our products.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I won't be able to rome around to find interesting new products as the <a href="http://microsoft.com/windowsxp/umpc/default.mspx">Ultra-Mobile PC</a>. But I will try to spot new POS products through press releases and corporate sites, and publish these on the <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">Point Of Sale weblog</a>.</p>

         	<p><img src="uploads/2021/4b93fde017.png" width="173" height="70" alt="Edgeio" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.edgeio.com/">Edgeio</a> is a new service to create classifieds directly from your weblog. It automatically organizes entries tagged with <code>listing</code> on the Edgeio site, and allows visitors to search and comment on listings. The concept sounds very interesting to me, so I decided to try it out.</p>
<p>The only thing I have for sale at the moment are web server accounts, so I created three posts on the <a href="http://blog.brytenet.com/">BryteNet blog</a> describing the three web hosting packages <a href="http://brytenet.com/">BryteNet</a> currently offers. I tagged all posts with the keyword <code>listing</code> as well as some additional keywords. After that I signed up at Edgeio, claimed my blog and noticed that the posts were already appearing on the site, including a thumbnail made from the image I used in the post. Though they offer the possibility to encode the list price in the blog post as well, I had not mentioned the price, so I edited my Edgeio entries to list the corresponding price. Conclusion: it is very easy to get listed on Edgeio.</p>
<p>After that I went to the customer side of Edgeio, to see how my listings would appear. One great feature of Edgeio is that you can enter your location, and it will filter the listings based on the distance you have chosen with an AJAX slider. I started by putting the slider on 'Lleida' to see only listings from my home town. As expected, there are only a handful of bloggers here, only my own listings showed up.</p>
<p>I moved the slider up to 'Catalonia'. To my surprise, I found that only one other Catalan blogger uses Edgeio, offering jobs in Barcelona. There are quite some bloggers in Catalonia, but apparently none of them has found Edgeio yet. I continued to 'Spain' finding three more offers, bringing the total on an amazing eight!</p>
<p>It is clear that Edgeio is not ready for prime time yet. Though it is easy to get listed, not many bloggers use the service, and therefore it is not worth the effort at this moment to search for listings on Edgeio.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/02/17/progress-with-ez.html">Progress with eZ Publish</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2006/02/17/progress-with-ez.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-02-17 11:58:47 &#43;0100">Feb 17, 2006</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been playing a little bit more with <a href="http://ez.no/">eZ Publish</a> for the <a href="http://BryteNet.com/">BryteNet</a> site. One little disappointment was that I could not generate <em>friendly URIs</em> like <code><a href="http://brytenet.com/forum/">http://brytenet.com/forum/</a></code>, but I have to work with URIs as <code><a href="http://brytenet.com/index.php?/forum/">http://brytenet.com/index.php?/forum/</a></code>. According to the eZ people this is because BryteNet has set up PHP as a CGI process and not through Apache&rsquo;s <code>mod_php</code>, which understands the <code>accept_path_info</code> function. The Brytenet servers implemented PHP as a CGI process for security reasons, and there is no way to change this in an easy way. I still don&rsquo;t understand why this is such a problem, as other PHP applications such as WordPress are able to produce friendly URIs.</p>

<p>Anyway, maintaining a site&rsquo;s content with eZ Publish is very easy. I have been able to set up the whole content structure in no-time, and even made some changes to the default templates. Templating is more daunting, as the template language used is very, very complete. For the moment I have only made some small changes, and have concentrated myself on the actual contents of the site.</p>

<p>Today I also created a Dutch version of the BryteNet site, which was done within 5 minutes! Now I am translating all content, which is done in a very clever way. A single object (text, folder, image,…) can have several translations, and depending on the way you access this object, one version or the other is shown. So going to <a href="http://brytenet.com">http://brytenet.com</a> gives me the default (English) view of the home page, while <a href="http://nl.brytenet.com">http://nl.brytenet.com</a> will show me the Dutch view of the same object. Very neat! I still have to translate the FAQ section, which for the moment will show the default language, even if I request the Dutch view.</p>

<p>When all has been translated into Dutch, I will add Spanish and Catalan too. And probably about the same time I will start tweaking my templates to change the components shown and the layout of the pages. The nicest job, making a unique design for this site, I will keep for the last, as it is the most logical order, and to have something to work to.</p>

         	<p><img src="uploads/2021/1be7092b0f.png" width="400" height="107" alt="Brytenet" /></p>

<p>The last weeks I have been very busy with the new <a href="http://brytenet.com/">BryteNet</a> site. The old site had been created in a couple of minutes 'just to have something', and never changed afterwards. It was really time for a complete site overhaul. When planning the <a href="/2006/01/a_little_update/">datacenter move</a>, I decided not to restore the old site, but to put a simple page with the main properties of the hosting packages and contact information instead. That gave me the chance to built the new site properly.</p>
<h3>ClientExec</h3>
<p>My first concern were the existing users of the server. I quickly installed <a href="http://www.clientexec.com/">ClientExec</a> and created accounts for all users, so they can manage their helpdesk tickets and billing information. Installation was very easy, and within an hours I had everything set up. I still want to change the templates to fit in the new BryteNet style, but that can wait 'till later. I did modify the template to include the Google Analytics code. After all, I still want to know what is going on…</p>
<h3>It's a Small Place</h3>
<p>The next step was to restore the <a href="http://blog.brytenet.com/">BryteNet weblog</a>. Since the new server has Fantastico installed, I only had to fill in some details, and WordPress was installed. I copied the plug-ins I used to the right place and restored the database to get the old content, and I was finished. 29 minutes was all I needed!</p>
<h3>eZ Publish</h3>
<p>For the rest of the site I had chosen the <a href="http://ez.no/">eZ Publish</a> CMS. While eZ Publish is probably way too big for such a small site, I wanted to use it for its execllent multi-language support and since it can do literally anything. So I can manage all aspects of the site (product information, contact forms, customer forum,...) with a single tool. eZ Publish also has a weblog module, but for the moment I have chosen to stick with WordPress.<br>
I had looked at eZ Publish before, and have big plans for it for future projects, but without a concrete implementation, it is difficult to find out what the possibilities and limitations of this CMS are.</p>
<p>Installation was a breeze, and I have been able to activate the features I wanted to use at the moment. The templating system is very powerful, though I find it still difficult to find the right template when I want to change a part of a page-layout.</p>
<p>A little disappointment was that eZ Publish is not able to generate friendly URI's when PHP is implemented as CGI rather than with mod_php. For security reasons PHP is run through CGI on the BryteNet servers, resulting in the appearance of <code>index.php?</code> in the middle of the URI. It is something I will have to live with…</p>
<p>Another problem I still have to solve is that the automatically generated menus only contain folders, and I haven't found a way yet to include links outside eZ Publish in the menu. I have found something on the subject in the eZ forums, and will tackle this problem soon enough.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The next big thing I am going to work on is to give BryteNet an unique face. At the moment the three components of the BryteNet site (eZ Publish, ClientExec and WorkPress) still use their default design, which I only modified a little bit. I om going to generate a completely new stylesheet for those sites, so they will have more or less the same look. I started my work with designing a new logo, and am now working on the colour scheme. I have some ideas on how the result will be, but am still experimenting with those ideas.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more news…</p>

<p>I have to identify myself in order to get Internet access?! How on earth do they think to stop terrorism by asking for identification for terminal access, while I can have a wireless connection without identifying myself?</p>

         	<p>It has been some time ago since I last posted, so I thought I needed to spend some minutes to explain what is happening.</p>

<p>As usually when a site does not get updated anymore, I was simply too busy. First of all, I have been traveling. And in my case, travelling usually means working many hours (yes, I considder a diner with my client ‘working’) and a lack of Internet connections. This time my hotel did have two PC&rsquo;s in the lobby which I used occasionally, but I would have preferred an affordable (free?) WiFi connection in my room.</p>

<p>Besides travelling, I am preparing a datacenter move for the <a href="http://brytenet.com">BryteNet</a> server. As this is the first time that I am doing such a thing, I want to prepare it very well and get all the details right.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the moment. Until later&hellip;</p>

<p>As most of you know, I hate paperwork.</p>
<p>So when <a href="/2002/05/paperwork/">after a lot of effort</a> I received my residence permit in 2002, and it appeared to be only valid for 4 months, I quickly decided that it was not worth the effort. Fortunately, coming from another EU country I have the privilege to not really need it in daily life, so there was no problem. I can use my Dutch documentation for identify myself.</p>
<p>The only thing I can't do is to buy expensive goods as a new car or a house. I had forgotten completely about these limitations, until we started <a href="/2005/06/car_hunting/">looking for a new car</a> last summer. We did buy the car on MJ's name, but I decided to go for it again and hope that they would give me a longer lasting residence card. That was in August 2005:</p>
<p><strong>August</strong><br>
I started by obtaining the necessary papers and filling them in. I also tried to phone to the immigration office to get an appointment for delivering these papers. After two weeks, I got my appointment, which fortunately was after the business hours of my office.</p>
<p><strong>September 8</strong><br>
After leaving the office I went to the immigration office to deliver all papers I had prepared: a special form, copies of my passport, copies of my current, expired, residence card, copies of my last salary statement, an extract from my record in the town hall…</p>
<p>Fortunately I had understood the cryptic instructions correctly, and all papers were in order. They told me that they were going to study my request, which was going to take them a full month!</p>
<p><strong>November 9</strong><br>
Time to find out whether they had approved my request. Unfortunately, this can't be done with an appointment, so you simply had to queue up at the immigration office. I told my boss that I was going to arrive late, and joined the queue two hours before the office was going to open. I only had about 20 people in front of me. I already knew from last time that I would have to spend the whole morning in the queue if I would not be there before they open their doors. After spending three hours on the street, and waiting 20 minutes more inside the office, I finally got a bunch of papers back; my request had been approved. I had to go to the bank to pay the administration costs and then to the police office to get my residence card. I payed directly, and decided to visit the police the next day, since the queue was too big already.</p>
<p><strong>November 10</strong><br>
I told my boss that I would arrive late again, and joined the queue 90 minutes before opening time; the queue at the police station is smaller. This time I only had 12 people in from of me. After waiting two hours on the street, I was allowed to enter to show the papers I received at the immigration office and place my signature and fingerprint on a special form so they can create my residence permit. They need one full month for doing this.</p>
<p><strong>December 30</strong><br>
Because of the cold and the amount of work I had in December, I didn't go to pick up my residence permit until three weeks later. Once again I told my company that I would arrive late and once again I had to queue on the street, but this time only 45 minutes. Almost five months after filling in the forms I finally received a little card, which fortunately is valid until 2010.</p>
<p>Renewing my residence permit has cost me €7, but most of all a lot of precious time. I spent about 6 hours waiting in queues on the street, 45 minutes in queues inside offices, and have been out of office during 3 hours. To me that sounds like I have wasted a lot of time for a simple administrative request. I mainly have been transporting papers from home to one office, and from one office to another; something which could easily have been done by mail. I know that I have to show up in person to get an identification document, but does this have to be for each and every step??? And why do they need a full month to check my history and approve my request and a full month to print out a little plastic credit-card sized pass???</p>
<p>As most of you know, I hate paperwork.</p>

         	<p>Our house is one of the few places on earth where you can still find a television without remote control.</p>

<p>We have been thinking about upgrading it to one of those modern TFT or plasma screens, but have been waiting for affordable models that incorporate Digital Terrestrial Television. Until today…</p>

<p>DTT is available for some time now, but television sets are still running behind on this. This morning I ran into a very good offer for a Nokia Mediamaster 110 DTT set-top box.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/77749139de.png" width="250" height="130" alt="Nokia Mediamaster 110" /></p>

<p>I connected and configured it well within 5 minutes, effectively upgrading our old television set to a TV with remote control, teletext and 20+ channels while we used to have 8 channels.</p>

<p>This small device just saved me a lot of money!</p>

<p>Tuesday a vulnerability has been discovered allowing atackers to execute remote code on the server.</p>

<p>When a fix was published I immediately installed it on the server, but the site had <a href="http://blog.brytenet.com/2005/12/15/brytenetcom-defaced/" title="brytenet.com defaced">already been hacked</a>. To make matters worse, the fix files contained errors, which made that phpCOIN did not produce any output.</p>

<p>My server error log showed me where the errrors were, and by adding some parentesis I could fix my site.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.phpcoin.com/auxpage.php?page=download">official fix files </a>are now three days old, and still contain these errors. There are more and more people running into this problem asking for wroking, so I uploaded my fixed files for download.</p>

<p>Note that the original fix file contains more files, so you need to install those files first and then overwrite the three files with errors with my copies.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2005/12/19]</strong>: The official fix files have been updated, so my files are no longer necessary.</p>

<p>Now that I have <a href="/2005/12/rss_bandit/">left Bloglines</a> and use RSS Bandit, it came to me that Bloglines is still fetching all those feeds in my name.</p>
<p>So if <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a> reports 9 Bloglines readers, I really should subtract one of them, since I am not using Bloglines anymore.</p>
<p>Of course I could go back in and delete all my subscriptions, but nobody ever does that, do you?</p>
<p>I wonder how many of Bloglines' reported tens of thousands of people are zombies like me, still subscribed to feeds but not actually using Bloglines anymore to read them. And does Bloglines disable accounts after a certain period?</p>
<p>Of course the same goes also for other web-based feed aggregators.</p>

         	<p>I have been looking at <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Personalized Homepage</a> (<abbr title="Google Personalized Homepage">GPH</abbr>) before, but quickly decided that it has no additional use for me.</p>

<p>GPH offers you the possibility to add content (RSS feeds) to the Google Search home page, which is fine if you only use three or four news sources to stay up-to-date. But if you use several more news sources, you probably already use a feed aggregator to read them, and don&rsquo;t need the GPH.</p>

<p>I did like the idea of seeing the weather forecast on the homepage, but unfortunately neither Lleida nor Harmelen are available in the configuration of this widget. Microsoft does this better on their <a href="http://start.com/">Start.com</a> portal, since it does have information for Lleida, and correctly recognizes Harmelen to insert the weather forecast for Utrecht.</p>

<p>Today Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/build-your-own-google-homepage.html">published an API</a> for GPH, which hopefully will set a lot of creative programmers to work. At this moment I am only interested in two widgets: a better weather widget and an e-mail linked to my normal POP3 or IMAP mail, since I normally don&rsquo;t use GMail.</p>

<p>I have switched my RSS reader from the web-based <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> to the PC based <a href="http://rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a>.</p>
<p>I have always used Bloglines, since I wanted to access my feeds from anywhere, but recently came to the conclusion that I only read feeds from exactly two PC's.</p>
<p>Whenever I am traveling, I hardly have the time or possibilities to connect to the Internet, and usually only read my e-mail.</p>
<p>Bloglines has many features, but misses one: the ability to work off-line. One of my wishes was to be able to search through feeds while being off-line, which by nature is something Bloglines cannot offer.</p>
<p>Another, less important, feature I missed in Bloglines is a three-pane view: folder-headline-text. A three-panel view saves time when going through a big list of headlines.</p>
<p>While I am still tweaking RSS Bandit to my wishes, I am quite satisfied with it. I get through my feeds faster and can spend my off-line time reading as well. RSS Bandit has a nice little feature that lets me upload the feed list and the read status to a FTP server, so I can continue where I left off on another PC.</p>

<p><a href="http://squidoo.com/">Squidoo</a> is open for public. Squidoo is a community where members, lensmasters, built <em>Lenses</em>. A lens is simply a page with information about a certain topic.</p>
<p>I joined the beta some weeks ago after reading the <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/10/the_next_free_e.html" title="Everyone's an Expert (about something)">e-book</a> by <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, and have created some lenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/pos/">Point Of Sale technology</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/sangers/">The tech-life of Jeroen Sangers</a>;</li>

<li><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/powerbook/">Apple Powerbook</a>;<a href="http://www.squidoo.com/host/">Types of web hosting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far the tools to built lenses, and the time I had available to use them, are limited, but it looks like a viable initiative. Squidoo is still considered a beta, but they already earned some real money:</p>
<blockquote><p>5,241 Lenses Made    $148.88 Earned</p>

<p>Looking up addresses is fast. The search function on my Palm and the excellent LookOut plug-in for Outlook are very fast. But updating information cost more. I regularly receive address changes from companies of friends. And if it is a big company I might have dozens of entries for it in my address list, which I have to update one by one. The same happens for friends and family. I usually have two entries for each ‘couple’, so I can store birth dates and mobile phone numbers. But they share the same address and home phone.</p>

<p>My ideal PIM application would store ‘contacts’ in two separate but linked tables: an address and a person. If I change the address, it will change for all persons within that address. Yes, that would be great!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Recently there has been a lot of attention for web statistics: first <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/">Mint</a> was launched, introducing design and AJAX to web statistics. Soon after that, old-timer NedStat got bought by <a href="http://www.webstats4u.com/">WebStats4U</a>, which lost most of its clients by adding unwanted advertising to sites using the NedStat counter. And last week Google re-launched <a href="http://www.google.com/analyitics/">Google Analytics</a>, previously known as Urchin. There is a lot going on in a market just as old as the Internet.</p>
<p>As long as people have created web pages, they have been interested in knowing who is visiting their pages. Most web statistics packages already exist for years, and the only changes they have made to their products are the inclusion of new browser detection and more advanced bot filtering. And the inclusion of RSS readers of course.</p>
<p>The first statistics I ever used was the NedStat counter. I only had to place an image on my home page, and NedStat would tell me the referrer pages, countries, and browsers. Ver neat!</p>
<p>Then I moved to another hosting provider, which gave me access to the server logs. I installed <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AWStats</a> and got <a href="/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com">incredible statistics</a>. Now I can see which search bots spidered my site, which file types are more popular, and which files are missing (404 errors). It is all in the server logs!</p>
<p>And now I am playing with <a href="http://google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. Google's application does not use my server logs, but require me to add a piece of JavaScript to each page. The results are once again a step up from what I had: Google does not only show technical reports, but also has <em>views</em> for marketers and executives, showing things like ROI and tracking your <em>goals</em>.</p>
<p>As a technology-oriented person, I first set the <em>webmaster view</em> as my default view. But Google's webmaster view gives me less information than AWStats. It does not tell me about 404 errors, it does not show me bandwidth numbers, it does not show me login names.… The other views in Analyze are great, and very useful when managing my sites, but I do miss webmaster information.</p>
<p>I wish it would be possible to ‘enrich’ the data Google collects with my server log files, <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner </a> reports, etc. With <a href="http://google.com/base/">Google Base</a> they laid the foundation for adding content, they only have to implement in into analyze.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2005/11/23/how-to-add.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2005-11-23 10:14:00 &#43;0100">Nov 23, 2005</time></a>

<p>We all heard about the problems <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is having at the moment: after the launch they <em>experienced extremely strong demand, and as a result, have temporarily limited the number of new signups</em>. Not only have they <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/?p=36">stopped accepting new signups</a>, but they also don't allow existing users to add new website profiles.</p>
<p>After the launch I managed to get signed up, and submitted one of my sites to evaluate Google Analytics. Today, about a week after my signup, Google Analytics finally shows me the results. And I like it a lot! So I want to add Google Analytics to my other sites.</p>
<p>In the Website Profiles screen I read: <em>To track another website with Analytics, click the 'Add Website Profile' link</em>, but there is no such link in that screen. The help function directs me to the signup screen with the message that they do not accept new signups. What to do?</p>
<p>I loaded the Website Profiles page in my favourite HTML editor, and find the following code:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;!&ndash;
&lt;td class=&ldquo;list_control_cell&rdquo; align=&ldquo;right&rdquo;&gt;&lt;span class=&ldquo;plus&rdquo;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&ldquo;admin?vid=1151&amp;scid=XXXXXX&rdquo; class=&ldquo;normal&rdquo;&gt;Add Website Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&ndash;&gt;
</code></p>

<p>They simply commented out the ‘Add Website Profile’ button! I open the page linked in the code, and Google adds my new website profile without any problem! So to add another website profile, you only have to log-in at Google Analytics and go to the following URL, replacing the XXXXXX by your own user number:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX">https://www.google.com/analytics/home/admin?vid=1151&scid=XXXXXX</a></p>

<blockquote>The idea is very good, but as you say, nobody is going to do this manually, and in all those months (years?) since the original idea, nobody implemented it in any CMS.

<p>I got corrected immediately by David Winer, who&rsquo;s site has a very good implementation of <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2005/11/22.html#When:6:54:40AM">purple numbers</a>, using the edit time as an anchor to make sure each permalink is unique.</p>

<p>Another comment pointed me to a WordPress plug-in, which of course brings the question: Did anybody make a plugin for Movable Type?</p>

<p>It looks like the application noticed that I am connecting from Spain, and is trying to serve me a localized page, but fails to do so. I tried to change the ‘accept languages’ string of my browser, but that did not make any difference. I also switched from Firefox to Internet Explorer, but without results.

         	<p>I just noticed that I have published exactly 499 entries on Brain Tags. Time to add number 500!!!</p>

<p>So this is number 500, a milestone. Not that it has been difficult to write that much articles, since it took me almost eight years (I wrote the first entry on November 24, 1997). Of course I didn&rsquo;t start writing regularly until I moved to Spain in 2001, when I had written only 27 entries in four years. You can follow my writing progress on the <a href="/about/entry_comments/">Entries &amp; Comments</a> page.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am still going strong, and still enjoy writing. So much that I am not only writing on Brain Tags, but also write on the <a href="http://pos.braintags.com/">POS blog</a> and on the <a href="http://blog.brytenet.com/">It&rsquo;s a Small Place</a> business weblog of <a href="http://brytenet.com/">BryteNet hosting</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, TailRank definitely seems to like my story!</p>

<p>Anyway, I mailed the image above to Kevin A. Burton, exlaining him:</p>

<blockquote>Hello,  
I just started looking at TailRank, and I am very impressed.  
I send you a screenshot of a results page, which I think might be a little bug you might want to look into. All I did was import my OPML file and submit the latest entry of my weblog. As you see, this entry appears several times on the result page.  
Kind regards,

         	<p>Let&rsquo;s continue talking about feed reading. Last week I described the <a title="Brain Tags: Feed reading lifecycle" href="/archives/2005/11/feed_reading_lifecycle/">five phases of feed reading</a> I had observed. Or actually the first four phases are observations, while the fifth phase is purely speculation.</p>

<p>And exactly this fifth phase was the part I received the most feedback on. I found <a title="News in a Newspaper: Information Overload" href="http://mybroadsheet.blogspot.com/2005/11/information-overload.html">somebody agreeing</a> with this tabloid view. I also received this e-mail from <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</a>:</p>

<blockquote>That's interesting.
I don't agree that that's phase five.
Why? Cause I keep meeting interesting people I want to have conversations with and who aren't in Memeorandum (or who won't be in the tabloids).
Robert

</blockquote>

<p>I have to admit that I did not think a lot about the fifth phase when I wrote it down. It was simple the first idea that came to my mind, and I jotted it down. Raw blogging…</p>

<p>But after reading the reactions, I thought it oer again. What exactly do I expect? How would I like to receive my news?</p>

<p>The tabloid model and Memeorandum do a nice job in selecting, but there is one thing neither of them covers: they are both excellent in selecting the top stories which everybody likes, but fail to select the top stories <em>I</em> like. There is no personalisation, and feed reading has everything to do with a personal experience.</p>

<p>What we really need is ‘clever’ feed readers, applications that know what I like and what I am not interested in.</p>

<p>My first idea is to use a Bayesian filter, which is already succesfully used to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">identify spam</a> and to <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/Downloads/KamensPaper.pdf">route helpdesk requests</a>, on a big set of RSS feeds and have it select the most interesting items. I rarely have very original ideas, and there are many people spending more time on feed readers, so somebody must already have had the same idea, and maybe even already worked it out. A little bit of searching lead me to 0xDECAFBAD, who tried it out and <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/07/further-smart-aggregator-musings">found that it did not work so well</a>.</p>

<p>I know that the idea is still new, and that this is just one test conducted by one person, but it is clear that more work has to be done in this field. For now I start playing with the new <a href="http://tailrank.com/">TailRank</a> service, which partly solves my problem according to all those people who have written about it the last days.</p>

         	<p><img src="uploads/2021/a041932d10.png" width="172" height="114" alt="Carrefour" /></p>

<p>I urgently needed a particular piece of electronics. So I checked the manufacturer's web site top see where I could buy it. After phoning all possible shops in Lleida, I reverted to an on-line shop. I looked at the available options and choose the <a href="http://tecnologia.carrefour.es" rel="nofollow">biggest company</a>. That turned out to be my biggest mistake:</p>
<p>On <strong>October 24</strong> I connected to their site, found my item and saw that they had it on stock. The site mentioned a delivery time of 7 days, which was fine, since I needed it in 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>October 25</strong><br>
I received an e-mail confirming my order, after one day!, and a request for a copy of my identification card. Of course I immediately sent this.</p>
<p><strong>October 28</strong><br>
I checked the order status on the web, since I had not received a confirmation of reception of my message. The status mentioned ‘missing information’, so I sent an e-mail asking for the current status.</p>
<p><strong>October 31</strong><br>
I still hadn't heard anything, and started to become a little bit nervous. So I phoned their customer support. They told me that there was a delay, and they were waiting for their supplier to deliver the goods. They could not explain me why the item was shown to be in stock when I made my order.</p>
<p><strong>November 2</strong><br>
I received an e-mail from them, telling me that there had been an ‘incident’. I phoned them and asked them whether they would be able to deliver the item on time, since I needed it in 6 days. They assured me that it would not be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>November 3</strong><br>
I would not let them forget me, so I phoned again. They told me that they had the item in their central warehouse, and that it was now passing quality control. They should be able to send it me in one week. I patiently explained them that I really need the item in a few days. The nice guy one the other side said that he understood me and that he would pass a message to the quality control department. I expected that it would be possible to ship it to me on the next day, but told me to phone again.</p>
<p><strong>November 4</strong><br>
I faithfully phoned again, hoping that they'd been able to send me my device. But instead of that, the nice lady tells me that they can not deliver within the next two weeks. Besides that, she tells me that there has not been noted anything about my phone call the day before! I explain once more that I really need the device, and that they'd promised me that it would be possible to deliver it on time, but she says that there is nothing she can do. I cancel my order…</p>
<p>Only little time left, so all I can do is find a shop that has the device in stock and pick it up personally. I start with the big outlets in Barcelona, and after phoning 7 of them I am able to reserve my item. I hop in the car, drive 160 kilometres, pay some money —hé, this shop is even cheaper than what I found on Internet!— and drive home happily. I promise everybody that I won't buy anything from Carrefour!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Though RSS feeds are still only used by the ‘<em>lucky few</em>’, I discovered several phases of RSS reading behaviour:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In <strong>phase 1</strong> you discover RSS. You are very enthusiastic about having the possibility to see all the news from your favourite resources in one place. When visiting a web site you first look for the orange XML or RSS icon to subscribe. People in phase 1 typically subscribe to 1-50 feeds. You feel very efficient, since all news automagically appears in your feed reader; you've saved yourself hours of useless browsing;</li>
    <li>After a while you realize that there is a lot more out there: your 50 feeds are not even the top of the iceberg. You have entered <strong>phase 2</strong>. Once in while you find an interesting post outside your feeds, but since the rest of the posts from this author are about his cats you decided not to subscribe. Since you don't want to miss the good posts you set up some ‘search feeds’: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a>, <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and friends search the blogsphere for your interest, and automatically notify you. You spend hours tweaking your queries, since you don't want to miss anything. All feeds are nicely organized with a separate folder per subject. You are now checking over 100 feeds on a daily basis;</li>
    <li>What started with 5 minutes every day, now cost you over an hour. And you can't skip a single day, since that will cost you two hours next day. <strong>Phase 3</strong> is hard work, with an ever increasing number of feeds to read. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/30.html#a8331">Robert Scoble mentioned reading 900+ feeds</a>! You know that something has to happen, so you start wielding out your feeds. You unsubscribe feeds of old contacts, feeds about subjects you are no longer interested in, feeds of dead sites… You also put a break on the new feeds you subscribe to. You create a '‘<em>probation</em>’ folder for new feeds, and selectively promote feeds to your main folders. Despite all these efforts you don't feel like you're in control: you are juggling instead;</li>
    <li>Usually external influences force you into <strong>phase 4</strong>. You simply don't have the time anymore to spend hours a day reading. There are two ways to deal with phase 4: people who go the drastical way simply delete all their feeds, except for the 10 feeds that really matter. After all, if something really important happens everybody will write about it within a few hours. The trick is to pick out the relevant feeds publishing all the news you are interested in.
Other people are more careful, and simply regroup their feeds by reading frequency: the 10 feeds to be read daily, about 50 feeds to be read once a week if you have time, and many feeds more just in case you want to read them on a bored Sunday afternoon. Reading is a pleasure again, and you feel in control knowing that you can't possibly read everything out there but won't miss any important news.</li>
    <li>In <strong>phase 5</strong> you see the light! Imagine an army of professional editors searching all available news, and selecting the best pieces. Even better, they publish their results on a handy paper based format called tabloid, which you can take with you wherever you want. And finally, you will be interrupted only once a day.</li>
</ol>

<p>[Insert fancy graph here]</p>

<p>Inspired by Jason Kottke, I entered phase 4 today. I regrouped all my feeds, and reduced the number of feeds in Bloglines. Furthermore I told Bloglines to notify me only when new items appear in my &lsquo;top&rsquo; folder. The first result has been amazing. I had a busy day, so only read my top feeds. I still have a feeling of what is going on whithout having to spend a lot of time reading.</p>

         	<p>I just received a cheque from Google. They pay whenever I pass $100, which in my case takes a while. But everytime the cheque arrives it is a happy moment.</p>

<p>The arrival of my cheque also triggered a chain of thoughts about advertising on my site. A little bit more than a year ago, I added the Google AdWords to this site. I simply took the existing pages, and looked where I could fit in the AdWords box. Since it was a test, I didn&rsquo;t spent too much time tweaking my templates; I just wanted to know whether it worked. In the past year I have made some minor changes, mainly to try out the AdWords program.</p>

<p>As I said, I had some thoughts about this whole advertising thing. One of these thoughts is that I should rethink the design of my pages so that the advertisements blend in better. If I take advertising seriously, I should also give the ads a better position on my pages (<em>above the fold</em>) of course without taking too much away from the content.</p>

<p>I also want to try out Chitika, which I heard gives good results as well. I placed some Chitika adds on my site, like the one above, and will monitor it during the next weeks. As you see, Chitika&rsquo;s eMiniMalls look far more <em>sexy</em> than Google&rsquo;s AdWords. But are they also more effective?</p>

         	<p>The past 48 hours I have been diving around in our brand new Toyota Corolla Verso, and I feel the King of the road. That feeling mainly comes because this car makes a lot more noise than our previous, old, car, and because it is so much higher. I can look over the cars in front of me, and see much more when I am passing dangerous crossing. In short, I feel more in control, and that is worth a lot when driving in a chaotic Catalan city.</p>

<p>This weekend we&rsquo;re going to make some more kilometres to try out the 6th gear and the cruise control.</p>

<p>We just came back from a week&rsquo;s holiday in the Netherlands. The aim of our holiday was to relax, and we succeeded. Instead of running from one ‘obligatory’ visit to another, as we usually do when visiting my home country, this time we put the emphasis on what we want. This visit to the Netherlands has been touristic than any previous visit, and we loved every minute of it.</p>

<p>Of course the fantastic weather helped a lot; it was sunny every day so we could spend a lot of time outside in nature and on the terrace. We visited amongst others Amsterdam, Utrecht, &rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch, Zeist, Amelisweerd, Lelystad, and Enkhuizen.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;re back in ‘real’ life we are already looking forward to our next visit at Christmas time!</p>

         	<p><em>It&rsquo;s a small place</em> is a new blog I created today. You might be wondering why I am starting a new blog while I even haven&rsquo;t got the time to update Brain tags regularly! The truth is that I am blogging just as much as always, but I spread my writings over several sites to prevent clutter.</p>

<p>If you are interested in my personal life and general writings about technology and travelling, Brain Tags is the place to be.</p>

<p>And if you are interested in news and my opinion about the Point of Sale market, I give you the <a href="http://pos-wizard.com/">POS Blog</a>.</p>

<p>And now I have <a href="http://blog.brytenet.com/">It&rsquo;s a small place</a>, giving you a view behind the curtains of a small part-time hosting company.</p>

<p>I have started writing about what I did to set it all up, with todays article telling on how I got the idea to start a hosting business. Of course, Brain Tags readers already know <a href="http://braintags.com/archives/2005/06/dreaming/">the answer</a>, but I included it for completeness.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s a small place</em> is also the first site I created in WordPress. For the moment the set-up is very basic (I only changed the default templates) but you can expect some more tinkering in the coming weeks. So far I have been impressed by WordPress: the installation was peanuts, and there is plenty of functionality. The user interface is not as sleek as the Movable Type interface, but I value function over looks anyway.</p>

         	<p>The last two weeks I have made two business trips; I visited London and the Netherlands. The last two weeks there have been no changes to this site. The obvious conclusion is that travelling and writing don&rsquo;t go together. I have encountered some reasons for this incompatibility:</p>

<ol>
    <li>It is hard to find Internet connections. I spend most of my time in meeting rooms or in the car, without any computer in the neighbourhood. The rest of the time I am in restaurants or in hotels, where I can rarely find an Internet terminal and they have one it is ridiculously expensive.</li>
    <li>I work a lot more. Since I don't have a home or friends to go to after work, I usually work the whole day. When I arrive in my hotel room, all I do is some zapping on the TV (does anybody know a hotel that does not offer that horrible CNN?) and go to bed.</li>
    <li>There is nothing to tell. Since I don't do anything special and do not read my feeds, I have no inspiration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, Im back home again, and will pick up my ‘normal’ life during the next days.</p>

         	<p>Street theatre is nice, since it is small-scale and personal. The acts are small, and the audience is small. That&rsquo;s why they got out of the theatre, and onto the street. That&rsquo;s why it is called street theatre. A great way to get to know street theatre is to visit a theatre festival. Edinburgh has the most famous theatre festival in the world, and Tàrrega has the most famous Spanish festival. Tàrrega happens to be quite close to Lleida, so tonight we&rsquo;ll be walking around in the streets of Tàrrega to see what is happening in the marvellous world of street theatre.</p>

<p>This year we found something curious. There was one show we really liked to see (Toni Alba), but this show is performed in a theatre. The curious thing is that we are going to look at a street theatre artist, those artists that are too small for a theatre, that is so popular that he&rsquo;s playing in a theatre. The other curious thing about this show is that it starts at 1:00 o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>

<p>The street where I live is just inside the ‘blue zone’, the zone where you have to pay to park on the streets. The payment machines are activated on working days from 9-14 and 16-20, the other hours you don&rsquo;t have to pay.</p>

<p>I never pay, since these hours coincide more or less with my working hours, so I can park my car in front of our door for free. The only exception is the end of the morning: I work until 13:30, and usually arrive home 15 minutes later. So officially I have to pay 15 minutes, 15 eurocent, every day, which I never did until today.</p>

<p>When I come home I always pass the parking control, as they are talking to each other while waiting for the end of their shift. Every day I see them standing on the same corner, and I know that I can park the car in the blue zone without having to be afraid that they will fine me.</p>

<p>The controller on the photo might just have started this job and was simply doing his job, or she does not get along very well with her colleagues or maybe simply had a bad day and wanted to share this feeling ;-).</p>

<p>Anyway, the result was that I ended up paying for 5 minutes of parking to avoid problems.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>We all know that almost all comment spam is coming from virus infected PC&rsquo;s turned into zombies. For a while I suspected that these zombies work with a list of URIs to attack, since attacks always follow the same pattern: suddenly I receive a lot of comments from various IP addresses, but all using the same referrer and posting more or less the same message. Usually attacks take about two days before the comment spam slows down. Very few of all these comments make it through the Movable Type spam filters, and usually adding the URL to the blacklist takes care of them forever.</p>

<p>Since upgrading to version 3.2 I did not receive any single comment spam. The reason is that I forgot to rename the comment script. One of the first measures I took against comment spam was renaming this script, so bots using Google to find spammable sites would not find me. With the latest update, I forgot to do so. Now, the list with spammable URIs these spambots use, contain hundreds of links to a script that does not exist anymore. So they do not even reach my comment-spam filters!</p>

<p>Even better, they fall into another trap. I catch all request for ‘inapropiate’ files as system files and non-existing scripts (formmail.pl), and automatically put their IP address on a blacklist, which is cleaned up after two weeks. This blacklist has been growing like crazy the last week, due to all these MT-spammers requesting the old location.</p>

<p>Until they refresh their list, I can sit back and relax!</p>

         	<p>After I left Harmelen four years ago, I also stopped participating in youth activities. Of course I have done some work for <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/" title="Fédération Internationale des Mouvements Catholiques d'Action Paroissale">Fimcap</a> as their webmaster, but I never visited or participated in any activity.</p>

<p>Last weekend we went to Vall d&rsquo;Aran to spend 24 hours in a Roundabout camp.</p>

<p>Roundabout is a Fimcap project in which two groups from different countries spend their summer camp together. This Roundabout was between three groups (Germany, Malta and Catalonia), and this was the third year of the project. Since we knew the Maltese animators and most of the German animators very well, we visited them to meet our old friends again.</p>

<p>Because the group had been together for already a week and the participants knew each other from former years, we decided to stay on the background to not disturb the group dynamics. That gave us many possibilities to analyse the activity, and compare it to our own experiences. People active within a youth organisation already know that there are huge differences between groups within a single organisation, let alone the differences between different organisations from different countries — this is one reason Fimcap is so interesting.</p>

<p>Anyway, the atmosphere was very relaxed, and everybody was enjoying the activity. And we? We were very happy to meet our old friends again, and get up-to-date with all the gossip.</p>

         	<p>At this moment I am updating my MT sites to version 3.2. This is a huge update, and I am running into some issues. My dynamically published <a href="http://pos-wizard.com/">POS Blog</a> is currently unavailable, because the core smarty libs are missing in the installation file. I receive the following error message when requesting a page:</p>

<p><code>main(/home/jeroens/public_html/cgi-bin/mt/php/extlib/smarty/libs/core/core.load_plugins.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory</code></p>

<p>My normal blog also gives me an error when rebuilding, stating that I used some tags in the wrong way:</p>

<p><code>Error in tag: You used an &lsquo;MTEntryDate&rsquo; tag outside of the context of an entry; perhaps you mistakenly placed it outside of an &lsquo;MTEntries&rsquo; container?</code></p>

<p>I hope to solve these issues, and other issues I find, as soon as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I just read &lsquo;<a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/life-hacks/how-to-tip-properly-116689.php">How to tip properly</a>&rsquo; on lifehacker, and was very surprised to read about pre-tipping:</p>

<blockquote>In busy clubs or at crowded bars, it is acceptable to “pre-tip” the bartender. This encourages him to respond promptly to your needs, and it keeps you from waiting at the bar. A pre-tip is always at least 5 dollars (and more often 10 or above, depending on how crowded or upscale the bar is). Despite the amount, it should not comprise the whole of your tipping. One dollar for every 2 drinks afterward is typically sufficient to maintain their interest.

</blockquote>

<p>What a huge bullshit!!! Why did we let it go this far?!</p>

<p>First of all, tipping is a way to express my thanks for the delivered services. If I decide to pay a little bit extra, I decide how much I will give. In many places I read tipping rules like “you should always give 10%”, but for me there is only one rule: how do I value the <strong>extra</strong> service delivered to me. I put emphasis on extra, since I always assume that normal service is already included in the price. I pay for a coffee, and you bring it. If I read in the quote above that I have to pre-tip in order to encourage the waiter to respond promptly to my needs, I&rsquo;d rather go to another place, since this waiter is simply not doing his job! He should be paid less, not more!</p>

<p>Furthermore, why do we only tip in bars and restaurants? Don&rsquo;t the hairdresser and the cashier of the supermarket work just as much or even more? And who ever gave a tip to the electric co.? OK, skip that last one, since they will never do something extra for me.</p>

<p>The point is, I see tipping as something general. If you do something extra for me, I pay you extra. If you deliver the basic service, e.g. you bring me my cup of coffee when I order one, I pay only the required amount. A tip is something you need to earn!</p>

<p>Today, I proudly present my latest work: <a href="http://www.brytenet.com/">BryteNet</a>.</p>
<p>BryteNet is going to be the name under which I am going to manage my hosting activities. I am certainly not going to be the cheapest hosting provider, but my prices are far lower than the average European hosting company (XS4ALL still asks €23 for only 50Mb space) and I can support you in English, Dutch, Spanish and Catalan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the only limits I put in my packages are disk space and bandwidth. I offer <strong>unlimited</strong> POP3 mail, mail forwarders, FTP accounts, mailing lists, mySQL databases, and subdomains; you decide how to use your space!</p>
<p>Go have a look at the site, and tell me what you think of it.</p>

         	<p>To make dreams come true you need two things: focus and time. Without focus a project takes way too much time, and without time…</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="/2005/06/dreaming/">I had a dream</a> that I wanted to come true. With some spare time in the weekend and in the lunch breaks, which are 2½ hours here, the second factor was available. I struggled a little bit more with the first factor, since I tend to jump from database design to logo design to testing out e-mail automation. But I managed to stick to my plan:</p>

<ul>
    <li><del>Create a new domain;</del></li>
    <li><del>Install WHM;</del></li>
    <li><del>Move my current sites from TotalChoice Hosting to WHM;</del></li>
    <li><del>Define my hosting packages;</del></li>
    <li><del>Install phpCOIN;</del></li>
    <li><del>Create a PayPal merchant account;</del></li>
    <li><del>Install IPN module and test Paypal;</del></li>
    <li><del>Define products and prices;</del></li>
    <li><del>Test the order and invoice processes;</del></li>
    <li><del>Test helpdesk e-mail processing;</del></li>
    <li><del>Write Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy;</del></li>
    <li><del>Tweak hundreds of parameters;</del></li>
    <li>Design a nice logo;</li>
    <li>Create a new stylesheet</li>
    <li>Add some more information about the server and the hosting plans;</li>
    <li>Add <em>hosted by</em> buttons to my current sites;</li>
    <li>Make some publicity;</li>
    <li>…profit!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is fully operational, but it has a horrible design. I hope to fix all that this week, take my summer holidays and open the site on August 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

         	<p>A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the shepherd…</p>

<p>“If I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?”</p>

<p>The shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully-grazing flock and calmly answered, “Sure.”</p>

<p>The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his IBM Thinkpad and connected it to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas. He sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a response. Finally, he prints out a 130 page report on his miniaturized printer then turns to the shepherd and says… “You have exactly 1586 sheep.”</p>

<p>“That is correct; take one of the sheep.”said the shepherd.</p>

<p>He watches the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his car. Then the shepherd says: “If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my animal?”</p>

<p>“OK, why not.” answered the young man.</p>

<p>“Clearly, you are a consultant.” said the shepherd.</p>

<p>“That&rsquo;s correct.” says the yuppie, “but how did you guess that?”</p>

<p>“No guessing required.” answers the shepherd. “You turned up here although nobody called you. You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and you don&rsquo;t know crap about my business… Now give me back my dog.”</p>

         	<p>Our car is about to reach 300.000 km, and the bills of the garage tell us that it is time to say goodbye to our Fiat Punto and start looking for something else.</p>

<p>The first question,new or second hand?, was quickly answered; as the second hand market is almost inexistent here in Spain. Everybody buys new and keeps driving it until the car reaches the same stage as our current car. We will probably end up buying a new car, unless we are lucky enough to buy a showroom model.</p>

<p>The second question, what kind of car?, was also easily answered: we live in the city centre, so big cars are out of the question. And considered my length and the fact that we regularly use the car to go away with our friends, really small cars are also not suited for us. So that leaves us with the regular tourist cars and MPVs.</p>

<p>Since every brand offers these models, we made up a list of all dealers in Lleida and started to visit them last Saturday. Unfortunately, almost all of them were closed, since the day before was a bank holiday! In the end we managed to visit the dealers for Peugeot and Renault, and came home with a lot of information about these cars.</p>

<p>We also bought some magazines with the typical list of all brands and models in the back, and while browsing all that information I quickly noticed that I simply had way too much information. I need a way to get rid of all surplus of information, I won&rsquo;t buy a Ferrari and don&rsquo;t have the slightest idea whether 150 Nm is OK or not, so fired up Google to search for the table in the car magazines in text or Excel format to play with.</p>

<p>Without success. It seems like all the car sites have been made only for car-enthusiasts. Usually the first selection you have to make is the brand and the model, which is exactly the information I want the site to give me! I am very disappointed in what I found.</p>

<p>When I am looking for a mobile phone of €50, I have hundreds of sites to help me, but when I am making one of the biggest purchases of my life, I fall into the hands of the salesmen without any help from the Internet.</p>

         	<p>The temperature is slowly rising to a level where there are only two places to stay: inside an air-conditioned office or on the beach. This weekend I choose the latter, resulting in a lot of time to dream…</p>

<p>I thought about this site, and how I am only using a fraction of the available disk space and bandwidth.</p>

<p>What a waste! What if I just sold the space and bandwidth I am not using? Should be easy enough, I already us <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/">cPanel</a> to manage the site, and I know that an additional script called WebHost Manager is available in which I can create new users and assign hosting packages. I could easily implement this without any additional cost.</p>

<p>What else should I need? A way to receive payments.… Most hosting providers I dealt with use <a href="http://www.2checkout.com/">2CheckOut</a> to receive credit card payments, and I could open a <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a> account as well. Both payment services take a percentage of the sales amount, both come without any set-up costs or monthly charges, so that&rsquo;s free of risk.</p>

<p>What else? I need to communicate with my clients. Some kind of helpdesk software, which also manages the client&rsquo;s orders and invoices and which can be linked to the two services above to cash in and preferably to WHM so accounts are generated automatically, after all, I rather spend my time on the beach.</p>

<p>There are some very good and complex packages available, but at this moment I am still dreaming, so I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much money, and certainly don&rsquo;t want to pay monthly charges. Google found <a href="http://www.phpcoin.com/">phpCoin</a>, which looks like it could be a good <em>face</em> towards my clients.</p>

<p>Mmmm, sounds like I could do it. Of course I have to spend some more time on the beach to think about details as the composition of the hosting packages I am going to offer and the name of my little hosting company (I already have some ideasj, and after that I need even more hours to implement all this and make a stunning design for the site. Will this dream ever come true???</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Most computers have two input devices: a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse is mainly used to navigate in the GUI, while the keyboard is used to enter data. Both input devices need some training to get used to, though I still picture my father picking up the mouse from the table and moving it through the air.</p>

<p>Experienced mouse users are ably to move the pointer from one side of the screen to the other side to click on a tiny button within a fraction of a second, which is becoming increasingly difficult as the screen resolutions get bigger. Besides moving and aiming the pointer, they know how to use the three buttons and the scroll wheel at the right moment. Advanced mouse users sometimes use mouse-gesture enabled applications to perform even more functions with the mouse.</p>

<p>Experienced keyboard users are able to reach high key rates using all ten fingers. Besides high speed data entry, they also use the <em>CTRL</em> and <em>ALT</em> keys to navigate through applications.</p>

<p>I rarely meet persons who have reached the highest levels in using both devices. Mouse–wizards usually type with two (or three or four) fingers, while keyboard enthusiast loose time navigating. The problem is that we do not have enough hands. Efficient use of both devices requires three hands: two for the keyboard and on for the mouse. Depending on the type of work done mostly frequently, people become either mouse–addicted or keyboard–bound.</p>

<p>In my work, I receive many interrupts and rarely work more than five minutes in the same application. As a result, my primary input device is the mouse. In the past I have tried to learn to type with ten fingers on the old mechanical typewriter of my mother, but due to my mouse use I have fallen back to a two finger system.</p>

<p>But things are changing. As my work slowly shifts from technical support to marketing and sales, I find myself writing more texts. And the more I write, the more I feel limited by my two–finger technique. I write slow and make many <del>n</del>mistakes. So I decided to use the mouse less and improve my typing skills, preferably using all ten fingers. I am aware that this is going to be very difficult, since old habits are hard to shake off and starting to write with ten fingers will initially decrease my typing speed even more, but I am convinced that I will be more efficient in the long term.</p>

<p>I do not have time to do a special training, but would rather learn it be gradually changing my habits. And of course a gadget freak like me needs some tools to help me. So the first step I took was to install <a href="http://www.activewords.com/">ActiveWords</a> on my computer. ActiveWords is a wonderful application in which you configure words to trigger events. To open the Firefox browser, I simply type <code>firefox</code> and my favourite browser starts. The trick for me is that ActiveWords lets me start applications faster by keyboard than by mouse, even if I use ten fingers to type. Another benefit of ActiveWords is that the Misspellings plug-in corrects my mistypings within any application! It works exactly like the auto correct feature of Microsoft Word, but is works system wide. I have been using ActiveWords for some days now, and even though I sometimes enter the keywords with only two fingers, I am very happy about it.</p>

<p>Another tool which I am planning to use more is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>, the amazing extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor. Emacs interests me for its huge range of features, which all can be controlled by keyboard. In the past I have met some Emacs-wizards who were able to write and edit very efficiently and I have used it a little bit in my UNIX days. I am aware that Emacs has a steep learning curve but it looks like a long-term winner for me.</p>

<p>Yes! I managed to get my phone configured, so now I am finally a member of the ‘moblog crew’. You can expect more pictures from now on.</p>

<p>The trick was to define another GPRS connection, using another APN name. Does anybody know what this APN is?</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2005.05.03]</strong>: APN stands for Access Point Name, which is the name of the destination network.</p>

         	<p>One week ago I received my new mobile camera-phone. I was happy, since I wanted to use it for publishing photo&rsquo;s on Flickr. How <a title="Brain Tags: New phone, same story" href="/2005/04/new_phone_same_story/">disappointed I was</a> when I found out that Amena had delivered me a half configured phone. No international roaming, GPRS, MMS or e-mail configured. :-( In short, my wonderful multimedia phone was delivered with all the multimedia functions disabled.</p>

<p>Now one week later, I have managed to get GPRS activated (I have to pay activation costs!) which also made MMS active. After talking 5 minutes with customer support they also told me that they have activated roaming, so the next time I go abroad I can call home. In theory, everything should be alright now, but… somehow I still can&rsquo;t send nor receive e-mail. And <em>that</em> is exactly the feature I want most!!!</p>

         	<p>Why is it so difficult to do? When I buy a phone, I want <strong>all</strong> functions to work. Since yesterday I am using my new phone that came with the new contract. Since this phone has a camera, I would like to take pictures and send them to my friends or publish them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that is not possible, since I do not have GPRS. Last year I had exactly <a href="/archives/2004/01/movistar_gprs/">the same problem</a> with Movistar, but that solved itself after a while. But now I want to send my photos, so I checked the Amena site for instructions. Without success. So tonight I will try out the support department. And when I speak to them I can also activate roaming, since they have decided to deactivate it by default since most people never leave the country anyway ;-).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> difficult to do it right!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>People are individualists; we prefer to do things alone and don&rsquo;t care about the others. Fortunately, we are also ‘intelligent’ and realise that we need other people in certain situations. But if this is not strictly necessary, we are selfish. This is a big pity, since we can do so much more when we co-operate!</p>

<p>I was realising this when I was waiting at the luggage belt of the airport. As usual, everybody was bending over the belt to see whether his or her luggage was coming and thereby blocking the view of the people behind him or her, who in their turn had to bend even more over the belt to see something. In this struggle, only the first person is able to see the luggage coming, and is able to get the luggage without problems. All others have two problems: they cannot see their luggage coming, and when they finally see their property, they are not able to get it because of all the people blocking the way. The solution is very simple: if everybody keeps 2 meters distance from the belt, <strong>everybody</strong> is able to see their luggage coming, and everybody is able to get to the belt to pick up their suitcase. If it is that simple, why won&rsquo;t people do this? Well, mainly because there is no incentive for the first person that has the view and the space no matter the distance to the belt. And when the first person chooses to stay close to the belt, all the others have only one solution: get even closer to the belt!</p>

<p>In my work I encounter the same problem. Whenever I have contact with a possible dealer in a new country, the word <em>exclusivity</em> falls within the first two conversations. They have seen our product and think it is good and have the idea that they can conquer the whole market because they have a better product. They are so wrong. Dominating a market is extremely difficult and usually does not depend much on the quality of the product (Microsoft?). If you want to sell a lot of our product, all you need is demand, which is difficult to create. The best way to do it is to have many, many dealers. If many dealers are offering this product, it will become visible. And when it is visible, clients start asking for it. This is how we work in the Spanish market. There are 400+ dealers of our product, and in some branches our product has become the ‘de facto’ standard. Local dealers sell a lot more because there are many other dealers offering the same products; they would never have reached those sales using an exclusive product. If only our foreign contacts could have this insight and allow for more competition in their markets. I am 100% sure that they would sell a lot more!</p>

<p>If people would be less individualistic, we could do bigger things!</p>

         	<p>Some weeks ago, we decided to change mobile provider. We have a contract with Telefonica Movistar, but most people we phone with are at Amena. We did some calculation and came to the conclusion that we could save on our bill by changing to Amena as well.</p>
<p>This weekend we finally found the time to head to the Amena office, and we explained out plans. The nice lady in the shop asked us some questions on our phone behaviour, who, when and how much, and she explained us about all the possibilities of the different packages. We made some quick estimations and selected the ‘right’ package.</p>
<p>Then the more important question came. Carriers earn so much money with all their inflated rates, that they can give away expensive toys. We could choose a new phone! MJ had prepared herself, and knew what her demands were: she wanted the cheapest phone that could flip open. Until now she always had candy-bar phones, but now she wanted clamshell. All other functions did not matter, since she only use the device for phoning and sending SMS messages. Her choice was the NEC e242.</p>
<p>Of course, as a reader of mobile expert <a href="http://russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell Beattie</a>, I know that there is more. Russ has the most incredible applications and uses for his mobiles, and it seems that he uses his mobile for everything I still use a PC for. But his phones are, even after the carrier discount, so incredibly expensive that it would take me years to earn that back with the cheaper rate of Amena. I guess Russ lives in another realm, but most people here choose between the five cheapest models. So I set my mind together, and thought logically. I don't phone a lot, I use SMS even less, and once in a while I use WAP to spend some dead time. Basically, any phone would be enough. But hey, I am a gadget freak, so I should have something additional to wish for, right? Maybe I need a camera on my phone, to update my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/">photo page</a> more often. That's it! I looked around, and saw a nice and cheap Samsung phone that according to the specs had a camera. I asked if I could see it, and fell in love with the device. Cool design, very light weight (they show the phones without batteries), but… without camera. I asked the friendly lady if she could show me the camera, but no, they'd made an error in the specs. So I took the cheapest camera phone they had: the NEC e242.</p>
<p>Now we have to find a way to keep our new phones separated!</p>

Hoewel alcoholverkoop zonder vergunning illegaal is, wordt er veelal niet tegen opgetreden door de controleurs van de Drank- en Horecawet. De Koninklijke Horeca Nederland (KHN) dringt dan ook aan op sluiting van de drinkschuren. Volgens een woordvoerder van de KHN werken de schuren alcoholmisbruik in de hand.</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, we take the opportunity to leave town for some days. Tonight we will drive to la Seu d&rsquo;Urgell, which is about 150km from here, and which will be our home for these days. Tomorrow we will visit Andorra to do some tax-free shopping and to enjoy the mountains. We will also take a bath in <a href="http://www.caldea.com/">Caldea</a> to relieve our tired feet after all those shopping kilometres. On Saturday we will drive to Barcelona, since we have tickets for the theatre.</p>

<p>Just like last year, the last two days of the CeBIT are very boring. The days are long since I spend most of it waiting or visitors.

<p>The EuroShop was in my opinion a moderate success. We made some good propaganda, but I would have liked to have more contacts. As with any trade show, the real result is only known after some months, when we know how interested the visitors of our booth were in our products.</p>

<p>The EuroShop trade fair starts Saturday, so you can imagine what is on my mind at this moment. I just finished packing my suitcase, and will take the airplane tomorrow morning at 8:00. Ai, that means I have to leave home at 4!</p>
<p>As I wrote before, I will be in hall 6, stand G30, the stand of the company <a href="http://www.wirth-gmbh.de/">Wirth</a>. Besides ICG Software, the hardware companies Star and AQSonic will be on the stand. It is the first time we are present on the EuroShop, so I have no idea what to expect. I imagine that most visitors are shop owners, but seen the size of the fair it could very well be that I will be able to catch some potential distributors as well.</p>
<p>Being on a trade show usually leaves not a lot of time for other things, and certainly not for surfing the internet. So I will leave the management of this site to the spammers for some days ;-)</p>

<p>Instead of publishing, I have spend some time thinking about my site. The trigger was the article <a title="Stinky links" href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/02/stinky_links.html">Stinky links</a> by Matt Haughey. At that moment I had just <a title="Feeds outsourced" href="/2005/02/feeds_outsourced/">created my FeedBurner feed</a> combining my posts with my Flickr photo's and my linkdump, and I knew that I had done something wrong. Readers following me because of my Movable Type writings are probably not interested in my holiday photo's, and people who want to know about my life abroad don't want to be bothered by my link dump. This site has a lack of focus, and I only made it worse.</p>
<p>The feed readers have the biggest problem, since they don't see the context of each entry. On the home page, my ‘<em>normal</em>’ entries take up the bulk of the space, the links are shown in the sidebar, and the latest photo is shown in the sidebar as well. People who read my feed, don't see the context; the three content types appear in exactly the same way. To solve this, I am going to offer three more feeds: one for my weblog, one for the links and one for the photos. They will be added to the current everything-in-one feed, to give my readers more choice.</p>
<p>Once the biggest problem has been solved, I want to restructure the links section. My main problem is the category structure, since I find it increasingly difficult to correctly place the items. I have to review the existing categories and their items, and will probably start using a tree structure with sub-categories.</p>
<p>Next, I want to split the weblog part in two parts: a web–tech site and a personal site.</p>
<p>First I will have to find out how to move certain categories from one weblog to another, but a little bit of SQL-fu should do, right? To link everything together I would like to change my homepage to a gateway to the different parts of the Brain tags empire. I guess this would also be the right moment for a new stylesheet, as I am getting fed up with light blue as well.</p>
<p>Once all that work has been done I want to start a new site, focused on a subject I work on every day, but which does not show up often on weblogs: point of sale software and hardware. I still have to work out my ideas on this subject, and I want to talk it over with some people, since it comes awfully close to a business weblog, but I think it would add something to the current blogosphere.</p>
<p>These are my ideas on the near future of Brain Tags. What is your opinion? Am I right, or should I go in another direction? I would like to hear and read your opinions.</p>
<p><strong>[Update 2005.02.17]</strong>: The first step has been taken. I added a new feed for the photo's: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainpics">http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainpics</a>.</p>

         	<p>It&rsquo;s trade show time! The coming weeks I will present our products in two trade shows in Germany. Note to self: start practising German.</p>

<p>The first show is the EuroShop in Düsseldorf. Though this show is aimed at end-users, I will go to support our German distributor. We will share the stand with some hardware companies. At the moment I am working vary hard to make leaflets for fashion shops, shoe shops, perfume shops, supermarkets,… Besides that I am double checking the quality of our German software and arranging a thousand of small things.</p>

<p>I will be in hall 6, stand G30. If you&rsquo;re in the neighbourhood, just drop by and I will show you our products in person.</p>

<p>The CeBIT is a show from which we expect a lot. There are many potential dealers walking around, who might know us from last year. As this is the second year we have a stand on the CeBIT, we are better prepared than last time. I can assure that the posters won&rsquo;t fall from the wall every 15 minutes this year :-D</p>

<p>After my return from the EuroShop I will start working full time for the CeBIT.
Our stand at the CeBIT is located in hall 1, stand 6i14.</p>

<p>It took a while, but I finally uploaded the photo's from our holidays in Thailand in August last year. I created a set, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/sets/90226/">Thailand</a>, to hold all of them<del>, but since I have a limit of only three sets I probably will remove it in the future</del>.

<p>I love the many ways of organizing photo's that Flickr offers!</p>

<p>Maintaining a site like this takes a lot of effort. After successfully having outsourced pinging external sites to the <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">Ping-o-Matic</a>, and using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> to host my photo's, I decided to start using the <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> service for making sure that all aggregators get up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Just as with the pings and photo's, the reason is that FeedBurner offers additional advantages (statistics, feed optimization, Flickr integration, ...) that I am currently unable to supply myself.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2005.02.02]</strong>: Besides moving my feeds to FeedBurner, I also combined all my feeds to a single feed.</p>

         	<p>This week a vulnerability has been discovered in Movable Type. Until today, I did not have the time to upgrade my MT installation, and I hoped that my site had not yet been attacked.</p>

<p>After upgrading I found an e-mail message from my hosting provider, stating that they had patched all MT installations on their servers!!!! Even though they don&rsquo;t support any software installed by their clients, they already patched my system to prevent damage. Each month I am getting happier with <a title="TotalChoice Hosting" href="http://totalchoicehosting.com/">TotalChoice Hosting</a>.</p>

         	<p>Referrer spam on this site is increasing daily. Until now I use a two-step method to block them, even though I don&rsquo;t publish my referrers. First of all, I maintain a list of used domain names. I check my referrers every day, and add newly found domains to the list. If a visitor uses one of these domains as referrer, the request is automatically blocked, and the IP address of the visitor is automagically put on a second list, making sure that future visits will be blocked as well. IP addresses stay on the list for one month, to make sure the size of the list does not get out of hand.</p>

<p>I noticed that the domains on my list are all mentioned in the MT-Blacklist. So those referrer spammers are also comment spammers. MT-Blacklist is updated automatically from the <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/">clearinghouse</a>, so needs less maintenance. It would be nice to be able to combine the two methods right?</p>

<p>Today I found <a title="derefspam.pl - Use MT-Blacklist rules to remove referral spam" href="http://www.juju.org/archives/2005/01/21/derefspam">derefspam.pl</a>, a script to use the MT-Blacklist to remove referrer spam from your server log files. At first thought I wanted to install it, but then I realized that all this script does is throw away information, so it won&rsquo;t pollute your statistics. Since I want to be able to see what really happened on my server, I prefer not to throw away this information. After all, these requests have consumed some bandwidth… A thought was to implement a script for each request, but I am sure that this will slow down my site too much, since database requests take time… For the moment I stick with my two lists, and hope that spamming will decrease soon.</p>

<p>It is amazing how many talented people there are. And many of them closer to you than you can imagine!</p>
<p>Yesterday we went to see <a href="http://www.enfado.tk">EnFado</a> in the city concert hall. EnFado is a quartet playing traditional portuguese fado music. The concert yesterday was given in co-operation with dancers of the citie's dance school, which gave the performance more to see. Between the songs they explained what fado is, and where it comes from.</p>
<p>The hall was completely filled, mainly with family and friends of the performers. Though I know them personally, I had never visited a concert before, and I have to admit that I liked it very much. Not that I am going to be a big fado fan from now on, but I was certainly enjoying the concert. Carol, the singer is such a personality on stage; she looks very comfortable standing on stage and doing her thing.</p>
<p>It wouldn't surprise me if we will visit a concert of EnFado again.</p>

         	<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know where Lleida is: it lies about 160 km south-west of Barcelona, in the centre of the Segre valley, surrounded by hills. These hills make that Lleida usually is free of wind, which has great influence on the weather in Lleida.</p>

<p>In summer, the lack of wind makes it 5-10°C hotter than e.g. Barcelona, with weeks of 40°C. The inhabitants prefer to spend their free time in the nearby pyrenees or beaches, which have a more pleasant temperature. As a result, Lleida turns into an empty ghost town in summer.</p>

<p>In winter, the lack of wind together with the lower temperatures create a dense fog, which stays for many days. At this moment we haven&rsquo;t seen a single ray of sun during almost two weeks. The frustrating of the fog is that is is very local. 20km outside of Lleida, in any direction, the sun is shining each day, and the temperature is 15-20° higher! Every day the news shows a clear wheather map, with one small white dot about 160 km south-west of Barcelona. :-(</p>

<p>We desperately want a little bit of wind, which will blow away the fog and show us that the sun still exists. If not, we will leave town in the weekend to get some sun and leave Lleida as a ghost town just like in summer.</p>

         	<p>Tomorrow will be the day that many Dutch blogs will show the special action page. The list of participating bloggers is getting bigger and bigger, and includes some prominent bloggers. You can read all about it on the <a href="http://www.buxx.nl/actie/">action page</a>.</p>

<p>Today I received the instructions, which consist of simply replacing the <code>index.html</code> page with the action page. This won&rsquo;t work for Movable Type blogs, since MT will overwrite the index.html page when a comment is posted to an entry. Furthermore, I wanted the page to show up for all requests, since many visitors enter the site through Google, and won&rsquo;t see the home page. And finally, I am a lazy person, so I want this to happen automagically.</p>

<p>Therefore I uploaded the file as <code>actie.html</code> and changed my <code>.htaccess</code> file to (temporary) redirect all requests for html pages to the action page. I used the following code:</p>

<p><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{TIME_YEAR}%{TIME_MON}%{TIME_DAY} &gt;20050105
RewriteCond %{TIME_YEAR}%{TIME_MON}%{TIME_DAY} &lt;20050107
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} index&#046;s?html$
RewriteRule ^(.*) /actie.html [L,R]</code></p>

<p>Furthermore I hace changed the action page a little bit. The page basically consisted of a table-based layout, with a single image showing the text. For once I won&rsquo;t complain about table-based layout, since we are working for a good cause, and I value the work they have put into this project. But I did take the freedom to add an alternative text to the image, so that visitors that cannot see the image also know what is going on.</p>

         	<p>My good ol&rsquo; club <a title="Jong Nederland" href="http://www.jongnederland.nl/">Jong Nederland</a> has a new site, based on the <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo Open Source</a> (MOS) CMS. The old site was based on home-brew PHP, and desperately needed a change.</p>

<p>It looks like they have the basic functionality up and running in MOS, but in my opinion they need to work a little bit more on the design. I am sure that they will fix it, since it already looks better than this morning. Of course the horrible &ldquo;Designed for Internet Explorer&rdquo; disclaimer has to go!!!</p>

<p>Further tips to make the site better:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Knowing the amount of events Jong Nederland has, it would be better to present an event list instead of a calendar;</li>
    <li>Mambo has a nice option to create friendly URL's, which only needs some changes to the <code>.htaccess</code> file;</li>
    <li>The section pages should be more descriptive and at least contain links to the sub-sections to make browsing easier. I had to look twice before I noticed the extra options in the menu;</li>
    <li>Jong Nederland has a huge collection of drawings and logo's, but these are not used at all in the articles. I want Kleppie and Molly Mol!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>As a regular contributor to the old guestbook, I need to browse my old JN stuff to find my membership number, so I can access the new forum.</p>

         	<p>The year 2004 is almost over, which means that it is time for reviews. All important media have a review, so Brain Tags as wel!</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>Lets start with the most important day of this year: August 7. For us the greatest thing of that day was to see all our friends and all our family together. Even though they could not understand each other, it was great to see how they tried to help.</p>

<p>Another personal highlight of 2004 was of course our <a href="/2004/08/thailand/">holidays in Thailand</a>. I still have to upload the pictures, but promise that I will do it.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>2004 has also been the year of new technology. It started with a <a href="/2004/01/a_new_computer/">a new computer</a> after cursing on the old one for over two years. I chose a cheap but decent white label box, and expect that it will last seven years as well.</p>

<p>After that came a new cellphone since my &lsquo;old&rsquo; one landed under a car. I am still very happy with my <a href="/2004/04/m55/">Siemens M55</a>.</p>

<p>And to bring back some structure in my life, I searched eBay for a <a href="/2004/07/palmone_zire_31/">PalmOne Zire 31</a> PDA. It is used daily, and can&rsquo;t image how I got things done without.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>Also my professional life became more interesting, with our participation at the <a href="/2004/03/cebit_2004_recap/">CeBIT</a>, and trips to <a href="/2004/05/cyprus/">Cyprus</a>, the Netherlands and Germany.</p>

<h3>Brain Tags</h3>

<p>And finally, this site. Since it is my hobby, I spend a lot of time tweaking it. This year, I have upgraded the CMS to <a href="/2004/05/movable_type_30/">version 3</a>, added a <a href="/2004/06/link_dump/">Link Dump section</a> to store links to interesting sites and texts, changed <a href="/2004/11/totalchoice_hosting/">hosting provider</a> since my old provider is going out of business and added a <a href="/2004/09/music_jukebox/">Music Jukebox</a> to offer MP3 files.</p>

<p>Quite a good year, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>

Today I put a file in the box of which I was sure that it would be popular. Why? Because the famous Boing Boing links to it.</p>

<p>And while I have enough bandwidth left for this month, I had no idea what to expect. 10 downloads? 100 downloads? 1000 downloads? More? In such a case, it is wise to monitor the traffic.</p>

<p>At this moment the file has been downloaded 170 times and has generated 835 Mb traffic on a little bit more than two hours:</p>

<p>If the downloads stay at this level, I can easily keep on sharing the file; but you never know what to expect when America gets active the next hours. I will keep on monitoring…</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.12.30]</strong>: The biggest peak is over, everything is quite now. The file only consumed 1,5 Gb bandwidth:</p>

         	<p>Since my parents are here to celebrate Christmas with us, we took them to a living nativity scene in Sudanell on the 25<sup>th</sup> of December. Each year they show some on the television, but I never actually visited one, so it was interesting for me as well. After buying the entrance tickets, I browsed through the leaflet, and found out that it was not exactly what I expected. I had imagined a place where the main figures would walk around with some animals, but in reality it was a lot more. There were 60 scenes in total with over 250 figures. Furthermore, the figures did not walk around, but stood still as statues. Each scene had been elaborated to the smallest details; everything looked right.</p>

<p>From the clothes to the tools they used! It took us an hour to see all scenes and reach the nativity scene. Besides biblical scenes from the christmas story, there were many scenes showing the life in that era: how to make baskets and soap, the work on the field, etc. We were very impressed. It was a pity that we were not allowed to make photo&rsquo;s, the flash would disturb the figures, but my parents bought a video tape showing all scenes. It is difficult to explain it to others, but we really felt like we were walking around in another era. Next year we surely try to visit another living nativity scene.</p>

         	<p>After the recent messages about comment spam, I have upgraded both Movable Type and MT-Blacklist. Not that my comment spam problem became bigger, since my setup is different enough from the regular MT site to stop them. I have renamed my comment script and, more important, I force commenters to preview. This alone blocks all spam coming in through the comments.</p>

<p>The problem is that once in a while I receive spam through the trackback interface. Since trackbacks, comments on my writings left on other sites, are always generated automatically, I have no way to force a preview and have to use the default workflow. As a result, once in a while a spammer gets through and manages to place many spam on my site before I have the time to add his URL to the blacklist. Of course, after that all spam is deleted with a single click.</p>

<p>Conclusion: So far I am still winning the spam war, but only because I am on top of it with upgrades and by quickly removing spam.</p>

<p>I just installed <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> on my PC to have a look at it, but really wonder what it adds. <a href="/about/feedback/">I am already available</a> through ICQ, MSN, AIM, Yahoo and IRC, and most of these services also support audio chats with reasonable quality. In my opinion Skype is just another IM client. I don't want to have yet another client, I only want that the existing clients work together. Of course, I don't have five applications running, I use <a href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a>, but it does open five network connections over different ports.</p>
<p>For the moment, you can Skype me at <strong>icg-jeroen</strong>. If I find it useful, I will keep on using it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is a great service for storing your photos, as everybody already found out. As the last person on the internet, I finally got to try their service out today, and just like everybody else I am very impressed.</p>
<p>I have uploaded a bunch of photos and started playing around. thing I like most is the tagging feature, allowing me to link keywords to photos. I like Flickr so much, that I am probably going to replace my existing photo gallery which I maintain in Movable Type by Flickr.</p>
<p>I will maintain the photos with Flickr, which will automagically create entries on my blog. The only thing I am not sure about is how to deal with comments, since both MT as Flickr allow visitors to comment on photos and I don't want my sparse comments split over two sites.</p>
<p>For the coming period I will be uploading and tagging photos, in preparation of the new gallery. You can follow the progress at my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/">Flickr page</a>.</p>

<p>In my quest for a good CMS I have been looking at <a href="http://www.ez.no/ez_publish/info">eZ Publish</a> this week, and my first reaction is: "wow!"</p>
<p>It looks very slick, very complete, very customisable, well thought out, … but also looks very daunting to implement.</p>
<p>The sky is the limit, since you can create your own content classes, but this involves also a lot of scripting templates to get the functionality to work. Previously I have been looking at <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo Open Source</a>, which is very easy to use, but has no fine-grained control; I just want to decide what HTML elements are used in templates. eZ Publish does give me this low-level control, but at a price: template design is more complicated.</p>
<p>Still I guess that I am willing to invest the time to learn the template scripting language, since eZ Publish has many benefits. The biggest benefit is that it can handle everything I do with external scripts: searching, guest book, forum, … Secondly, its multi-language implementation is great; the properties of each object can be entered in several languages, which will be shown to the visitor depending on the site access used.</p>
<p>I still have to play around a lot more to get to know its possibilities better, but I certainly have a very good feeling about this software.</p>

         	<p>The easiest way for a club, company or organisation to have a webshop is <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">CafePress</a>. You can upload your logo and select which products you want to offer, and they take care about taking orders, printing the products and shipment. Works like a charm, but they are USA-based. That means that European customers will ahve to pay extra shipment costs, which makes the items rather expensive. So I am looking for companies like CafePress with facilities in Europe to lower the costs.</p>

<p>So far I have found <a href="http://www.t-shirtzoo.com/">T-Shirt Zoo</a> and <a href="http://www.spreadshirt.de/">spreadshirt</a>, both of which look reasonable, but not as slick as CafePress. T-Shirt Zoo has a very small assortiment, and spreadshirt is only available in German. Are there any other companies like these available in Europe?</p>

<p>One of the nicest traditions in Catalonia is the ‘correfoc’: <em>corre</em> = run and <em>foc</em> = fire.</p>
<p>The Catalans love any excuse to have a correfoc, a riotous fiesta of sparklers, firecrackers, and roman candles, where <em>colles de diables</em>, or brigades of devils and dragons, dance threateningly to the strains of an accompanying percussion band as they weave through a startled and delighted public. In order to save your clothes, there is only one remedy: jump so the sparks roll off. We filmed a correfoc at October 8 in Sant Feliu de Llobregat, so you can see a little bit how it is:</p>

<p>I was looking for a hosting provider with more or less the same characteristics as my current provider; I only want a little bit bigger company to prevent problems.

<blockquote>Several technical problems with our backend have corrupted critical portions of our billing and support databases. While we have tried to recover this data several times and enlisted the help of an outside agency our efforts have been in vain. Although security has been very good we've found several discrepancies in our logs indicating the damage may have been intentional. For these reasons we have decided to stop taking new orders and will eventually cease operation altogether.

All servers will be monitored and remain online until January 1, 2005. At this time each server will be shut down. Henceforth orders for new service will not be accepted and current customers will not have their credit cards charged for these final two months. We regret this decision but after putting our best resources to work it has become obvious that the damage caused by the corruption is irreversible.

We would like to thank everyone that has made the last year and a half a great one.</blockquote>

<p>This site is hosted by <a href="http://www.bloghosts.com/">Bloghosts</a>, and I am very happy with their service. They are very cheap, and Jace, who runs the company, always gives great service. But lately they are having some problems. Not that it affects me, since my site has already been set up and runs fine. Fortunately, Jace has build up a lot of credit, and most existing customers <a href="http://rusty.yaaarr.org/index.php?p=640">understand the situation</a>, and are <a href="http://www.blogroll.org/index.php/weblog/reluctant-complaint-about-bloghosts/">willing to wait</a> until <a href="http://www.dino-blog.com/index.php?p=761">the problems</a> are solved.

<p>Now that I have burned my first DVD with material we recorded last summer, I want to show it to our friends and family.</p>
<p>But I notice a great difference between the people here and in Holland. All our family and friends here have a DVD player. Videotape is dead; DVD is the current device to use. It is almost impossible to rent a recent movie on tape. However, <strong>none</strong> of the Dutch people I have recently spoken have a DVD player! This includes my parents and my sister, probably the persons that are the most interested in our recordings.</p>
<p>This weekend I will have to spend some time to copy the DVD contents to tape, so I will be able to show them our adventures in Thailand when we visit them in November.</p>
<p>I am wondering whether Spain really is more technically advanced than the Netherlands (who would have expected that?), whether my friends and family here are more gadget freaks than the people we know in the north of Europe, or whether I simply did not speak to the right people in the Netherlands. Do you have a DVD player?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I ran across three situations related to censorship. They are not related to each other, but the coincidence struck me.</p>

<p>First, I found out that my hosting provider <a href="http://bloghosts.com/">bloghosts</a> closed their support forum. Bloghosts gives excellent service and support and I recommend them to everybody looking for a reliable hosting provider. A few weeks ago they had some internal technical problems with their servers, resulting in lost support tickets. While normally support tickets were answered within a few hours, in that period tickets got lost and were not answered. To get the attention of the support staff, some customers started complaining in the support forum. Since normally this forum is very, very quiet, about one post a day, these few people completely took over the forum. The forum is now closed…</p>

<p>Directly after that, I read the <a href="http://scoblecomments.scripting.com/comments?u=1011&amp;p=8431&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2F2004%2F10%2F19.html%23a8431">comments</a> on Robert Scoble&rsquo;s <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/19.html#a8431">Are you afraid to blog?</a>, which suffer from a troll called J.Toran. Some commenters requested Robert to remove these comments, but until now they are still there and I expect them to stay there.</p>

<p>And finally D. Keith Robinson wrote about <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archive/2004/10/comment-moderation-and-censorship">Comment Moderation and Censorship</a> after having to remove a whole thread.</p>

<p>As for censorship on this site, until now I only removed commercial comments (spam), but I reserve the right to moderate comments in some other situations as well, as is explained in the <a href="/about/comment_posting_policy/">Comment posting policy</a> of this site.</p>

         	<p>In the pas years I have written 375 entries, linkdump excluded, for this site, of which only 21, 6%, are related to my professional life. Does that mean that nothing interesting is happening during the hours I spend in the office? Does that mean I am not enthusiastic about my job?</p>

<p>Of course not. I don&rsquo;t write about my job because I don&rsquo;t know how my colleagues are going to react. The things happening here simply don&rsquo;t pass to my personal filter; the same filter that blocks all subjects that are too personal.</p>

<p>Lately I have been thinking about writing more about my job, since we are doing very interesting things, and I don&rsquo;t know anybody else writing about POS software, warehouse software and financial software. I thought about mentioning the idea to my colleagues before I start writing more, but is that really necessary???</p>

<p>I am clearly not the only person having these thoughts, and today Robert Scoble tried to convince all of us to <a title="Scobleizer: Are you afraid to blog?" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/19.html#a8431">not be afraid to blog</a>. He is absolutely right, corporate blogging can give another face to your company. I&rsquo;ll have to think it over a little bit more, and maybe soon you will find more news about <a href="http://www.icg.es/">ICG software</a> on this site. If that would happen, Robert Scoble can be satisfied about his work.</p>

         	<p>I just looked into the log files, and found out that people got blocked for trying to open old MP3 files from the jukebox.</p>

<p>The jukebox is supposed to handle all requests for MP3 files on Brain Tags. If the requested file exists and the time-out period has not passed yet, the file is served; in all other occasions a list of currently available files is presented.</p>

<p>However, after forwarding MP3 requests to the jukebox, all requests for old MP3 files got redirected to my spamtrap, effectively blocking visitors looking for MP3 files. Of course, I immediately fixed the problem.</p>

         	<p>After all <a title="Brain Tags: Video editing problems" href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/10/video_editing_problems/">problems I encountered last week</a>, I laid my little video project to rest for a while. Until yesterday; when I felt the itch of an unfinished project. In the mean time I found on the internet how to get around the rendering problem: I simply created another project that contained the problematic scene plus some footage before and after, rendered it to an AVI file, and included this file in my project. A few hours of rendering later I had my DVD!</p>

<p>Happily I inserted the precious disk into our DVD player to admire the result. But… all sound editing, sound levels and background music, I had done in the project had disappeared and in some scenes the sound was out of sync. Once again I was very disappointed! :-(</p>

<p>I got back on the internet, and search the Pinnacle support forums. There was a huge thread about this problem, which lead me to the <a href="http://pinnacle.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/pinnacle.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=7871">FAQ</a>. I have to update my software to version 9.0.8 to fix this problem. On the <a href="http://www.pinnaclesys.com/docsupport1.asp?division_id=1&amp;langue_id=7&amp;product_id=1501&amp;product_name=Studio%20version%209%20&amp;page_id=992">download page</a> I found a huge patch (46 Mb) to update to version 9.1.2. What bothered me most is that this fix is from June, while I purchased the software in September. They simply sold me a defect product, while they had already solved these problems!</p>

<p>I am downloading the patch now, and this afternoon I will buy a DVD+RW disk to try to burn my project again.</p>

         	<p>The PalmOne Zire 31 comes with a SD slot and a default, small, card of 16 Mb. It's basic use is to put MP3 songs on it, to be played with the RealOne player. Putting files on the SD card is very easy; you only have to drag the file to the QuickInstall icon, and the next time you synchronise it will put the file on the card.</p>
<p>However, you can only access the file from the Palm, there is no way to copy it back to a PC. I would like such a function, to keep some important documents with me, which I can access from any PC.</p>
<p>Therefore I was really happy when I found <a title="Card Export II. SD/MMC card inserted into Palm as USB mass storage drive." href="http://softick.com/cardexport2/">Card Export II</a>. This little application emulates a USB mass storage device on the Palm, so you can access it as a flash drive. But after installing it, I received an error message when connecting to my PC: <code>Cannot open USB port 0307</code>. I e-mailed the Softick support department, and two days later they presented a new version, which also works on the PalmOne Zire 31. Great!</p>

<p>The <strong>Dooie Donders Club</strong> is an infamous club in Harmelen, formed by four self proclaimed brothers. Until some years ago, they had a nice web site with plastic ducks and other toys as decoration. I made this site using Microsoft Frontpage, and maintained it for some years. It contained stories about the activities of this club, which had its highlight in 2000, with an appearance in the Dutch men magazine the <em>Panorama</em> and the production of their CD <em>Dagobert, de heerser hier</em>. Shortly after, the site disappeared, and the club became dormant.</p>
<p>Last week I accidentally found the text published in the Panorama, and thought that it was a pity that the history of the DDC is not available on the internet. But wait, maybe the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www1.tip.nl/~t086868/ddc/">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a> has saved something of that site. Indeed, it was all there. I quickly installed <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo Open Source</a> on my server, created a new subdomain, configured Mambo and copied the texts into new entries. And there it is: the <a title="Dooie Donders Club" href="http://ddc.braintags.com/">DDC</a> is back!!!</p>
<p>At the moment is a pretty default Mambo site, but I plan to make some custom templates to give the site some Dooie Donders sauce.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The past few weeks I have been working myself into a completely new world: video editing. It all started with the <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/07/19/a_new_toy/">camera</a> we received this spring. Of course we took it with us on holidays, and back home we wondered what to do with the tapes. They contained some nice material, but also a lot of &lsquo;crap&rsquo; produced when trying out the functions of the camera. I wanted to edit the video, and copy the result to a DVD for easy play back.</p>

<p>So I installed the tools that came with the camera on my PC, and connected it to an USB port, only to find out that the software is useless and that USB only supports low quality video. After looking around on the internet a little bit I ordered <a href="http://www.pinnaclesys.com/ProductPage_n.asp?Product_ID=1502">Pinnacle Studio DV</a>, a software suit that comes with a FireWire (IEEE-1394) PCI-card.</p>

<p>After installing the card, I set to work: I copied the tapes to my hard disk, and selected the scenes to be included. I made some dark scenes a little bit lighter, and adjusted the audio levels. After adding some smooth transitions and background music my video was ready for DVD. I set my PC to render for a few hours, and the next morning I had… an error message! I figured that it must be a full disk, so I cleaned up the disk and set it to render again. The next morning, I found the same error at the exactly same scene; a photo I included in the video.</p>

<p>After a little bit looking around, I found a log file, giving me a more detailed error message: <code>Max Video Bitrate:8494000 for disc output</code>. Mmmm. bit rate, that must have something to do with data throughput. Since the problem appeared in a photo, I decided to increase the JPG compression of the file and give it another try. Half a day later I found the same rendering error again. I was getting frustrated, and started to search on the internet, without results. Then I looked in the configuration of Pinnacle Studio, and saw that you could configure the bit rate for DVDs. It was set at <em>automatically</em>, which gave me 60 minutes of video per DVD. Since the error message mentioned a bit rate a little bit above 8Mb, I fixed the bit rate to 8Mb, and let my PC work again&hellip; with the same result as before. Now, I lowered it to 7Mb, and pushed the Create button again. In a few hours I will know whether that has solved the problem, but I have a bad feeling about it…</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.10.06]</strong>: I was right, the error is still there. I did a short test with a project containing only the photos involved, and it rendered correctly. It&rsquo;s time to see how good the support department of Pinnacle is.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Each morning before I leave home to go to the office, I take some time to see what is happening in the world. A few years ago, I used newspapers, radio or television for that, but nowadays we have internet. While eating a sandwich and drinking my coffee, I check my e-mail and scan the headlines of about 200 web sites. If I see something interesting, I read it or bookmark it to be read later.</p>

<p>This whole process takes me 20 minutes, thanks to my newsreader which fetches all information from those 200 sites and presents it to me in an easy digestible way.</p>

<p>However, this list of sites I want to keep up with is growing steadily; each week I discover new interesting sites, and add them to my list. When I finished browsing to my list today, I had to run to the office. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to adjust my alarm with 10 minutes to give me the time to read my news.</p>

<p>Just before starting to write all this down, I read that Robert Scoble has exactly the same problem, but worse. He currently checks 915 feeds, and in his entry <a title="Scobleizer: Dealing with the information flow" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/28.html#a8320">Dealing with the information flow</a> he wonders how scalable feed are, as more and more resources use them. What happens if the number of feeds grows up to 10.000?</p>

<p>I guess what is going to happen is the same as happened to the web. Ten years ago I scanned the NCSA <a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/whats-new.html">What is new?</a> list. First I looked at this list every week, but soon new sites appeared by thousands, and I left this method to keep up with new sites. Nowadays I use search engines. They are not the same, and don&rsquo;t give met the same feeling, but they scale better. With feeds the same thing is happening: at this moment I follow everything published on some sites, but soon I will have to fall back on <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a> to find what I want. I propose they will build some randomness in their queries, so I can still discover some unknown sites, and don&rsquo;t have the feeling that I am reading the same as everybody else.</p>

<p>I copied the two files to my server, made some changes to the configuration, and there it is: the Brain Tags Jukebox!!!</p>

<p>It needs a little bit of decoration, but the functionality is there. All songs will stay available for 96 hours, after which they will automagically disappear.</p>

<p>At this moment you can find You Learn About It from The Gathering, and of course the wildly popular new song from the Pixies Ain&rsquo;t That Pretty At All.</p>

<p>Happy downloading!</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.09.24]</strong> I added some <code>echo</code> statements to the PHP code, and the results looks a lot better. It is also valid XHTML now.
<strong>[Update 2006.11.9]</strong> More than two years later, the jukebox became obsolete and has been removed from this site.</p>

         	<p>Many people starting to implement the <a title="Buy GTD at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=braintags-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0142000280/qid%3D1095758355/sr%3D8-1">Getting Things Done</a> methodology start processing their inboxes full of energy. The first result is usually obtained within a few days: an empty inbox! Everything has been evaluated, using the well know flow chart, and stored in reference files, someday/maybe actions, next actions… Small tasks (2–minute rule!) have been finished immediately, and a lot of junk has been thrown away. Great!</p>

<p>Once the big mess is out of the way, you only need to maintain it. Process arriving items as soon as possible, and start working your way through the Next Action list. You even do your first weekly review, to see whether there are any open loops left. You feel that you are getting grip on your workflow.</p>

<p>But usually after two or three weeks, the doubts come up. The processing goes all right, but you have the feeling that actions come in faster than you can finish them. Your N/A list is growing and growing, and looking at your N/A list gives you the same feeling you had before when you opened your inbox. You don&rsquo;t know where to start or how you can set your priorities. You&rsquo;ve lost control.</p>

<p>At this point many people throw GTD out of the window, reasoning that if they spend less time organizing their time, they will have more time for actually doing things. This might be true for some people, but in many cases you simply need to adjust your system to fix the problem. If I have a question about GTD, I always first go to the source. The problem I described here appears on David Allen&rsquo;s site in the <a title="What do you do with the Actions list when it gets really long? Do you keep interacting with the whole list, or is there another alternative?" href="http://davidco.com/faq.php?detail=23&amp;category=3#question23">FAQ section</a>. David&rsquo;s answer is: <q>If it&rsquo;s &lsquo;too long&rsquo; either you need to get used to a big list of still-undone things […] or you need to make fewer commitments.</q></p>

<p>Of course this is very true if you implemented the system correctly. But in many cases, the problem is not the amount of commitments, but rather the way these commitments have been entered into the system. Before starting to use GTD, most people work with some kind of to-do list. New GTD users treat their N/A list in exactly the same way as their old list, only now they specify the context of the action. This is wrong, since a task is not the same as a Next Action. Anne Gennett explained it in an excellent way in <a href="http://davidco.com/coaches_corner/Anne_Gennett/article6.html">The power of the real next action</a>. In her example, the client needs new glasses. So he creates a N/A &lsquo;Get new glasses&rsquo;. But getting new glasses is not an action! Getting glasses is something you can&rsquo;t do. The real N/A is to email someone for the name of an optometrist, so this is what he should have put in his list.</p>

<p>If you look at a long list that contains items like &lsquo;Get new glasses&rsquo;, you get the feeling that you will never be able to finish the list. But if you put real next actions, your list contains easy to perform steps, and you will see that you can process your next actions more efficiently. <a href="http://davidco.com/coaches_corner/Meg_Gott/article15.html">The next action is the very first thing you need to do to move on that item.</a></p>

         	<p>Even the best drivers sometime get into situations in which they cannot prevent damage. I am not one of the best drivers, so I might get into this kind of situations a little bit more.</p>

<p>This morning when I was driving to the office, I noticed a dog crossing the road. The car coming from the opposite direction stopped, and the dog reached the other side of the road without problems. I was still far away from that point, but I noticed another dog standing next to my side of the road. I imagined that this dog would want to follow his friend, so I slowed down. About ten seconds after spotting the dog, I passed the dog, driving carefully. And exactly at that moment the dog decided to cross the road. I hit the brakes, but could not prevent hitting the poor fellow. Of course I immediately pulled down the car next to the road, and went to look for the dog. However, he was gone — I assume he ran away into the orchards next to the road. When I inspected the car, I noticed one bump and a broken spotlight. Tomorrow I will have it repaired.</p>

<p>I would like to use this opportunity to tell the owner of the dog that I am very sorry, but that I could not have prevented it. Sorry…</p>

         	<p>On my individual entry pages, I show two dates: the date on which I created the entry, and the date on which I modified the entry. Today, after making some changes to an entry, I noticed that the modification date was not updated.</p>

<p>I found some information about this problem in earlier versions of Movable Type on the <a href="http://tweezersedge.com/archives/2004/04/000371.html">Tweezer&rsquo;s Edge</a>, but they state that <a href="http://tweezersedge.com/archives/2004/04/000380.html">this error has been fixed in the 3.x versions</a>. I guessed that the same solution should work on my version (MT3.11 at the moment), I only needed to find out the right line in the scripts to fix. I tried some options, and found that the following fixes the problem:</p>

<p>Edit /lib/MT.pm, and add the text shown on line 598:
<code>596 $ctx-&gt;stash(&lsquo;entry&rsquo;, $entry);
597 $ctx-&gt;{current_timestamp} = $entry-&gt;created_on;

<p>If you want to leave a comment on this site, you have the option to identify yourself using your TypeKey account. <a href="http://typekey.com/">TypeKey</a> is a centralized authentication service from <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a>, the makers of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. It was developed as a measure against comment spam, and made available in version 3.0 of MT. After TypeKey was released I changed my templates to include this system. I do not force commenters to use TypeKey, since my spam problem is not <em>that</em> big.</p>
<p>This was in May. Now after some months more, I have some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides me, only <del>one</del>two commenters used TypeKey to comment on this site;</li>
<li>No other MT–powered site I comment on has TypeKey activated;</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&q=typekey%20profile%20page%20-site:typekey.com">Google search</a> on the default TypeKey comment link — TypeKey Profile Page — returns only 21000 hits. So only 21000 pages on the whole web have TypeKey authenticated comments — remember that some sites have many pages, with many posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me it looks like TypeKey is not used a lot.</p>
<h2>Why can that be?</h2>
<p>I think the main reason is that most of the sites using Movable Type never update their templates. They might update to a newer version of MT, but leave their templates alone. And they are right in doing so; I remember that it was quite a puzzle to add the TypeKey code to my template.</p>
<h2>So TypeKey is a failure?</h2>
<p>After only four months, it is very early to make this kind of conclusions. Every new site that starts using MT will probably have TypeKey activated, so I expect more and more sites to use is. And when the base grows, other sites might benefit more from this service as well.</p>

         	<p>I have plenty of bandwidth, and have been thinking about ways to use it. It appears to me that the best way to burn up my bandwidth is to serve MP3 files.</p>

<p>So as an <em>experiment</em> I offer you Ain&rsquo;t That Pretty At All from the Pixies, since this is becoming a Pixies site anyway.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that it is an experiment; I might withdraw the file at any moment.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.09.17]</strong> I guess a week is more than enough for this experiment, so I removed the file. I have obtained the desired overview on how MP3 downloads affect bandwidth useage. I also found out that Pixies fans are highly interconnected: until 2 days ago, the file was hardly downloaded, but after somebody published a link on a buletin board, the link was copied to many other buletin boards within a few hours, and downloads skyrocked.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.09.22]</strong> With the addition of the Brain Tags Jukebox to this site, I also returned the Pixies file. It will be available for another 96 hours.</p>

After that, the modem seems to connect just fine, but DNS is not working. The computer has received the IP addresses of the DNS servers, and I can ping to these addresses.

<p>Recently my server logs show a big increase in requests for a single image, the one shown above. Somebody must be hotlinking this image! Hotlinking is when somebody uses an image on their page, but does not put a copy of the image on their server. Each time somebody views that page, the image is requested from my server. In general, hotlinking images is not polite, since you use bandwidth of somebody else.</p>

<p>This specific image is not mine, I found it on somebody else&rsquo;s page and copied it to my server to use it.</p>

<p>There are several methods to stop hotlinking. You can block all requests that do not come from your own site, so all visitors of that site will see is a red x. Or you can serve another image instead, with a text explaining why hotlinking is bad, or with the Goatse man&hellip; I decided not to do so. First of all, since I have enough bandwidth to serve these sites, and secondly because I thought it would be better to use the image to make some advertising for my site. So I added this site&rsquo;s address to the image, so it will be shown on all sites using this image from my site.</p>

<p>The ability to create subcategories look really sexy, however I have doubts whether my writings need a more complex category structure. I will have to review all items to decide on that.</p>

<p>The feature everybody waited a long time for is dynamic publishing. It simply means that the pages are created <em>on the fly</em>, which makes posting entries and comments more faster since you don&rsquo;t have to wait for all pages to generate. However, the downside is that each normal view will be slightly slower, since the pages are not cached on the server. I will have to play a little bit with this to see what works best.</p>

         	<p>Almost a week ago we returned from our holiday in Thailand. The fact that I did not write anything about it yet has two reasons:</p>

<ol>
    <li>1. We have been too busy taking up our social life again, meeting friends and family, supper here, coffee/beer there... I simply did not touch my computers last week.</li>
    <li>I find it difficult to write about things that happened more than a day ago. And during my stay abroad I prefer to visit temples and markets over writing in an internet café.</li>
</ol>

<p>But since the first page of this site looks very empty, I will write a little bit about our trip.</p>

<p>Unlike all our previous vacations, we did not prepare the trip ourselves, but we decided to get &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; and have a travel agency work out the details for us. That means that we didn&rsquo;t have to think for a single second when we were in Thailand. The planes and the hotels were booked, and each morning they picked us up for yet another interesting excursion. Of course the downside of this is that we only ended up in places cramped with other tourists and did not make any unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>We visited Bangkok, Chang Rai, Chang Mai and Ko Samui. Each of these places offered basically the same: souvenirs, temples, souvenirs, tuk-tuks, souvenirs, great food, souvenirs, massages, souvenirs, fake watches, souvenirs, canals, souvenirs and souvenirs. Besides these basics, each of the places had something special: Bangkok is a true metropolis, Chang Rai has beautiful hills and their tribes, Chang Mai has a lot of traditional handicraft and Ko Samui has of course the beach.</p>

<p>There is much more to tell about our holiday. Maybe I will tell you about it over a good glass of beer, or someday I will write it down here…</p>

<p>Almost two years ago, Antipixel published a <a title="Steal These Buttons" href="http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/10/22/steal_these_buttons.html">set of minimal buttons</a> to replace the ugly buttons used by most people at that time.</p>
<p>They were modern, tight, fashion... so a lot of people started using them on their sites and many people designed buttons in the same style. I also preferred them over the traditional buttons, but I never placed them on my sites. Why? Because the Antipixel style did not mix with the style of my site. Just as it does not mix with the style of 80% of all sites. Still people use them. I guess because there is nothing better. Of course everybody is free to create their sites as they like, but I won't put Antipixel buttons on my site. They are soooo 2003…</p>

<p>There is nothing to celebrate yet, but the presents are already rolling in... In Holland people don't want to arrive to a party with empty hands; the people from here feel better when they know that we have already received our present when they arrive.</p>
<p>Anyway, our gadget collection has increased a lot last week. After buying the Palm Zire 31, we received a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=braintags-20&path=tg/detail/-/B0002CXBES/qid%3D1090253144/sr%3D8-1">Sony DCR-HC40E</a> video camera.</p>
<p>I haven't had the time yet to try out all its features, but we are going to take it with us on our holidays in August. That means that I have two weeks left to read the huge user manual and make a list of all features I would like to try out.</p>

         	<p>I was always thought that the Netherlands have two languages: Dutch and Frisian. Besides these two languages, many dialects exist. Spain in contrary, has 5 languages: Castilian, Basque, Catalan, Galician and Aragonese.</p>

<p>Today I found out these numbers are wrong. Or not? The languages I mentioned above are the languages that have an official status in those countries, based on history and culture. The real number of languages (linguistically seen) is higher: there are <a title="Ethnologue report for Netherlands" href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Netherlands">15 languages in the Netherlands</a>, and <a title="Ethnologue report for Netherlands" href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Netherlands">11 languages in Spain</a>. So Spain, which has twelve times the size of the Netherlands has less languages —and less water, but that is another subject— than the Netherlands.</p>

<p>For the curious readers: in the Netherlands, people speak Achterhoeks, Drents, Dutch, (Western) Frisian, Gronings, Romani (Sinte), Romani (Vlax), Sallands, Stellingwerfs, Twents, Veenkoloniaals, Veluws (East), Veluws (North), Vlaams and Westerwolds. In Spain, the following languages exist: Aragonese, Asturian, Basque, Caló, Catalan-Valencian-Balear, Extremaduran, Fala, Galician, Gascon (Aranese), Quinqui and Spanish.</p>

<p>The XML fan says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time for that! We must train all the audience members to recognise XML, and then start a committee to investigate the possibility of starting negotiations to form a working group to write a paper on the future evolution of emergency-announcement semantics!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I use Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>Not at home, but in the office. I know many people are stuck with Microsoft Outlook because their company uses an Exchange server, but that is not the case with me; I am free to choose. I use Microsoft Outlook because it allows me to do some things I can't accomplish with other tools, even though there are many things I don't like about Outlook.</p>
<p>The main feature that has become indispensable for my is the fact that I can adjust any view to my needs. I have a huge list of contacts, which I have grouped in two levels (country and company). That way I can quickly find contact information. Unfortunately, when I select a contact from a new message window, all I have is a huge flat list of contacts. Another feature I use frequently us the ability to add fields to items. All my task fields have an additional field called 'project', where I put the name of the project this task belongs to. If I group my tasks by project I have a good overview off all pending items per project.</p>
<p>The features mentioned above are essential for my functioning in the office. Some other features are simply handy to have. For example, conditional formatting allows me to change the <em>view</em> of an item, so that I can see quickly which items have to be processed today or in the coming week, and which items are in progress.</p>
<p>As bloated as Outlook may be (partly fixed by some add-ons), I haven't found a better PIM.</p>

         	<p>Six months ago I <a title="Brain Tags: 2k4" href="/2004/01/2k4/">set some targets</a> for myself for this year. Now that I am halfway the year, it is time to evaluate my progress:</p>

<h2>Learn to speak Spanish</h2>

<p>My Spanish is definitely better, simply because I have been using it some months more. I planned to study more structurally, but so far I haven&rsquo;t spent a single minute doing this. There&rsquo;s still work to do on this one.</p>

<h2>Say "ja"</h2>

<p>I am on schedule on this one; I expect to finish this task in 36 days.</p>

<h2>Call old friends</h2>

<p>I have more contact with my old friends in Holland than I had last year. However, for my feeling it can be even better.</p>

<h2>Finish work in the house</h2>

<p>The plans have been made, now all we have to do is say to eachother to start. I still have hope.</p>

<h2>Be less afraid of risks</h2>

<p>This is the most vague item on the list, and I don&rsquo;t know how I can &lsquo;measure&rsquo; the result. My feeling tells me that it hasn&rsquo;t changed much.</p>

<h2>Think about the future</h2>

<p>My plans for the near future, 2–3 years, are ready. But what do I want with the rest of my life?????</p>

<h2>Spend more time in the nature</h2>

<p>For several reasons, we haven&rsquo;t made as many excursions as we would like. Now that summer has come, the only nature we can visit is the Mediteranian Sea. This item has been postponed to autumn.</p>

<h2>Learn to program in python.</h2>

<p>Not started yet&hellip;
All in all I have the feeling that at 50% of the year I haven&rsquo;t reached 50% of my aims.</p>

         	<p>I have been using the services of <a title="Mobical" href="http://www.mobical.net/">Mobical</a> for some time now, mainly to back up my cell phone&rsquo;s contact list, and have been very satisfied. Once in a while I press the button on my phone, and I know that all my phone numbers are stored safely on a server in Sweden. They also supply a web interface to your data, so you can enter your contacts with more than nine buttons, but I never used that.</p>

<p>Today I visited them again, and noticed that they have created version two of their service. Version two is not backwards compatible, so I had to create a new account. After setting up my account, I uploaded the data from my phone, and looked around at the site. It all looks very professional, and I can imagine that some people use this as their main agenda contact list. It has a nice overview window with the upcoming meetings and tasks, and you can browse your contacts in an intuitive way. Notes have been implemented as post-it notes glued to each page, with the option to drag them with your mouse. Really neat&hellip; if you only have one note. I tend to store many small pieces of useful information as notes on my phone (I definitely have to buy me a Palm) and the pot-its became very annoying. I tried to close the &lsquo;windows&rsquo;, but a pop-up warned me that I was about to delete the note.</p>

<p>For the moment I continue to use Mobical as always: to back-up my data.</p>

         	<p>Summer in Lleida has a bad name. Being in the inlands without any lake and usually without even a small breeze makes Lleida a very hot place. The hottest months yet have to come and the temperature is already at 38°C. With this kind of temperatures you have only two options to spend your free time: inside the water (a swimming pool or the sea) or in the mountains. In both cases it is advisable to leave early in the morning, as driving a car can be unbearable during the day.</p>

<p>This weekend we chose the swimming pool option, since we didn&rsquo;t feel like driving very far. As a result, our activities were limited to those you can do in a swimming pool, which is basically limited to reading. Fortunately I still had to read the latest <a title="Linux Journal" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a>, but for next weekend I will have to buy some books.</p>

         	<p>Just like many people, sometimes my head bursts of all things I have to remember and to do. In fact, my short—term memory is terrible; I am able to tell you to do something and completely forget about it within 10 minutes. The reason for this is that I can be completely focussed on the action I am doing at the moment. I am aware of this problem, and have tried out many strategies to overcome this. How can I process the enormous amount of information I receive by e-mail, hear from colleagues and clients and read on the internet without getting drowned in it, so that I can actually get things done?</p>

<p>The answer for me lies in the last three words: for the last year I have been applying <a href="http://davidco.com/">David Allen</a>&rsquo;s methodology called Getting Things Done. This method looks a lot like the things I have been trying out before; only it is worked out a lot better. The basis is to process your inbox (which can be mail, paper, phone…) and fill your calendar and next action system. Combined with a weekly review, this system ensures that no action will slip out of your system, and you actually get things done.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/8b60a9f0b4.png" alt="GTD" width="366" height="409" /></p>

<p>Of course the whole thing is explained in more detail in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=braintags-20&path=tg/detail/-/0142000280/qid%3D1088009297/sr%3D1-1">book by David Allen</a>, but this scheme explains a lot.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/06/16/digital-vs-film.html">Digital vs. Film cameras</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/06/16/digital-vs-film.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2004-06-16 12:01:30 &#43;0100">Jun 16, 2004</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>More and more people are buying digital cameras; I even read that the digital camera sales outnumber the traditional film cameras nowadays. I am very happy with my Canon film camera, but after I have been playing with my parents&rsquo; new Sony digital camera last week I wondered whether a digital camera would be something for me. Of course as a gadget it would most certainly be welcome, but as a replacement for my current film camera it will need to add much additional benefits. So I made a little comparison:</p>

<h2>Pro digital:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Electronic format</strong>
Logically, digital cameras store photographs in a digital format. This makes it very easy to save them on your PC.</li>
    <li><strong>Easier handling</strong>
Related to the digital format, photographs taken with a digital camera are much easier to publish to the internet, to e-mail to your friends and relatives and to catalogue. Besides that you can easily retouch them using graphical editing software.</li>
    <li><strong>No film rolls</strong>
Since you don't need to buy film rolls, the costs per photograph will drop significantly.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheaper workflow</strong>
With a digital camera you work different. You shoot your pictures, delete the ones you don't like, store them on you PC and maybe you will print your best pictures. This is a very cheap process.</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity gives quality</strong>
Because the workflow is so cheap, you generally make many more images. This has two big benefits for the image quality: first you simply have a bigger chance making a photograph at the right place and the right time and secondly the more pictures you make, the more experienced you become. Professional photographers use the same tactic, but using film makes it way too expensive for amateur photographers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pro film:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Higher resolution</strong>
It is difficult to compare two completely different techniques, but in general film cameras have a much higher resolution. In digital cameras the important parameter is the number of Megapixels — even though the sensor size is more important — so experts have been trying to calculate this number for film cameras. Results vary, but most conclude that film cameras have a resolution between 15 and 25 Megapixels.</li>
    <li><strong>Bigger enlargements</strong>
The quality of enlargements is another feature in which the traditional camera beats the newcomers. A photograph made with a film camera can easily be enlarged to 40 by 50 centimetres, while a digital photograph will start losing quality at 20 by 25 cm.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheaper cameras</strong>
Film cameras cost only a fraction of their digital equivalents; sometimes they are even 90% cheaper.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic range</strong>
Digital photo chips have limits in dynamic range; at a certain moment a change in subject brightness won't result in a change in image brightness anymore. Films do not have this hard limit, but rather become less and less sensitive. The dynamic range of films is larger than the dynamic range of photo chips.</li>
    <li><strong>Proven technology</strong>
Film cameras on the market now do not differ much from those on the market five years ago. In general you buy a camera and use it until it stops working. A digital camera however, is new technology that is still being developed. You new 6 megapixel camera will be considered old within a year. I don't know anybody who is still using his one megapixel camera he bought two years ago, but I know several people still using a film camera they bought over a decade ago.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, digital cameras give you ease of use and electronic access to your photographs, while film cameras give you quality and are cheaper. The choice is up to you. For me it is not so important having a digital photograph — though I would like to publish more photo&rsquo;s on this site. On a cold Sunday in winter, I like to grab a photo album and browse through the images on my sofa. I don&rsquo;t think I can have that same feeling sitting behind my computer. For the moment I still prefer film cameras to digital cameras, but maybe I might buy a very cheap digital camera for those moments I want to send a photo by e-mail or publish it on this site.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox 0.9</a> has been released today. Of course I immediately downloaded and installed it. As the version number shows, this is still a <em>technology preview</em>, so there still are some things not working quite as they should.</p>

<p>The most important missing feature is a good installation procedure. To upgrade from version 0.8 to 0.9, I had to remove the old version, install the new one and after that I had to reinstall all my extensions — Bookmarks synchronizer, Bloglines notifier, Links toolbar. All together 10 minutes work to upgrade a simple application.</p>

<p>But alas, this was the last time I had to go through this, since the next version will hopefully be 1.0 and will include the upgrade functionality.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When you travel by car through Europe, you&rsquo;ll find that the traffic rules are more or less the same for all countries. Of course there are some minor differences as the maximum speed on —120 km/h in the Netherlands, 130 km/h in France— but in general the rules are the same. Nobody ever warned for the fact that the Standard European Traffic Rules are not valid in Spain. The confusing part is that the used signs are exactly the same, but the interpretation might surprise visitors from abroad. Therefore I decided to write here about the differences I experienced, starting with the most disturbing rule: the minimum speed.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/84cc33a47d.png" width="100" height="100" alt="50" /></p>

<p>Each road has a minimum speed, which is normally shown with a sign equally to the one above. In general the minimum speeds are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>inside towns: 50 km/h;</li>
    <li>open roads: 80 or 100 km/h;</li>
    <li>motorways: 120 km/h.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is <strong>very important</strong> to obey the minimum speed. Fortunately, the local drivers are very friendly and will warn you if you are driving slower than the minimum. They will signal with their lights and horns, wave with their arms and even shout at you. In case you miss these signals, they will risk their lives and approach you with their own car up to a distance of 30 centimetres. They assume that once you will notice them you accelerate to keep their lives out of danger.</p>

<p>While surfing the internet, I find so many interesting sites, which I usually bookmark all. Lately I found my bookmarks getting too crowded, making it difficult to find specific links. From now on I won&rsquo;t put them in my bookmarks anymore, but publish them on this site, for four good reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>My bookmarks list stays cleaner;</li>
    <li>I can use the search function to look up links;</li>
    <li>I can easily add comments;</li>
    <li>You also benefit from my findings.</li>

         	<p>I am facing a small CSS problem: I have a page with some blocks of content, of which I don&rsquo;t know the contents on beforehand. Therefore all blocks — defined by <code>div</code> elements — have the same definition. If the block contains text, it has to be left aligned; if the block contains an image, it has to be horizontally centred.</p>

<p>In the good ol&rsquo; HTML era, I would simply add <code>align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;</code> to the <code>img</code> element, and I would be done. But with CSS, the only way to centre an image is with <code>text-align: center;</code> to the parent element of the image. But this is impossible, since I don&rsquo;t know the contents on beforehand.</p>

<p>What I would want is to apply a certain style depending on the child element; something like: <code>div &lt; img {text-align:center}</code>. Since this kind of instructions do not exist, I will probably have to use some kind of JavaScript hack to accomplish what I want — or does anybody know a better solution?</p>

The old ones used way too many <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&rsquo;s and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>&rsquo;s, which cluttered up the HTML — these elements are today&rsquo;s equivalent of the tables in the 90’s. I decided to start from zero and only add those elements that I think are necessary. As a result, the new pages are smaller, which should make them faster for you.</p>

<p>To make things easier for me, I decided to use another Document Type Definition. This site is now <code>XHTML 1.0 Strict</code>, instead of <code>XHTML 1.1</code>. To me it feels a little bit like a loss, since I liked it that my site was on the forefront of web technology, but the hassle is simple too big. The biggest problem is that a lot of JavaScript won&rsquo;t work, and my knowledge is not enough to fix these things myself.</p>

<p>I also took the opportunity to activate the <a href="http://www.typekey.com/">TypeKey</a> service for those people who want to use it. It is not required; I only see it as a means for showing to the readers that it was really you who wrote this comment. As an alternative you can still use OpenPGP to certify your comments.</p>

<p>There are still some things not going quite as I wanted to, and the quickly adjusted stylesheet makes this site look even worse than before in Internet Explorer, but I will be working on those. If you notice any strange behaviour or mistake, please let me know.</p>

         	<p>Last week when I entered my hotel room and switched on the light, the TV turned on and showed me a welcome message explaining how to use Pay TV. First I did not pay any attention to this screen, and I started unpacking my bags. When I passed the TV for about the fifth time, I suddenly saw something I did not notice before. On the top of the screen I could see a blue bar with some letters below it. I was amazed. The welcome message was simply a text file written in Write, and the whole system appeared to be running Windows 3.1!!!</p>

<p>It has been a long time ago since I last saw Windows 3.1 in use. I thought that everybody had already switched a long time ago to Windows 9x, but it seems that there are still some of these legacy systems around. Surely the system is running good enough, so why change it?</p>

         	<p>I temporary disabled the comments on this site. The last days I have received too much comment spam.</p>

<p>Until two weeks ago, I could control comment spam by using the <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/">MT-Blacklist</a> plug-in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this plug-in does not work on the latest version of Movable Type,
so I had to remove it. MT 3.0D has the option to require commenters to sign up first before posting a comment, but I have not yet been able to get the JavaScript to work on XHTML 1.1.</p>

<p>Until I fix this, I simply keep a close eye on my comments, and remove any suspicious comment immediately. But the coming week I will be on a trip, and thus can&rsquo;t watch my comments.</p>

<p>Therefore I decided to disable the comments until I am back home again. If you have any comment, just use the <a href="/about/feedback/">Feedback</a> form.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Four days ago I upgraded the motor of this site to Movable Type version 3.0D — the D is for Developer edition. Unlike many others who installed this version, I was fully aware that this developer edition could have some problems with plug-ins. Here are my findings of the first days playing around.</p>

<p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>

<p>The first screen of the MT interface clearly shows a new item: the Movable Type News box. This box syndicates news from the Movable Type web site. Since I prefer to read my news in my feed reader, I immediately <a title="Brain Tags: Remove Movable Type News box" href="/archives/2004/05/remove_movable_type_news_box/">removed this box</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing changed in the main screen is the direct access to some weblog features. The 2.x versions had for each weblog links to create a new entry and to enter the entries list. Now you can also access the comments list, the templates list and the weblog configuration screen. The one thing I am missing here is the upload file feature, since I assume that bloggers will more often upload an image than tinker with their templates.</p>

<p><strong>Edit Entry</strong></p>

<p>Also the Entry Edit screen has some —minor— modifications. It is now possible to specify the entry date &amp; time the moment you create a new entry. In the older versions you first had to save your entry to modify the publishing time. That leaves only one feature that cannot be modified in new entries: the multiple categories.</p>

<p>Another change is that the edit buttons now also work in Mozilla based browsers, but only for the entry body. If you use the extended entry field, you still have to enter the HTML code yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>The comments list is new and handy feature to manage your comments. You can see the details and the status of the last comments, and open them from that screen. You can filter comments on e-mail, name and IP address, but unfortunately not on status. I don&rsquo;t receive many comments, but I assume that more popular sites would love to see only the comments that are pending for approval.</p>

<p><strong>Trackback</strong></p>

<p>In my definition, trackbacks are nothing more than comments on my entries left on other sites. I would like to treat trackbacks in exactly the same way as comments, but unfortunately trackbacks do not have status information.</p>

<p><strong>Plug-ins</strong></p>

<p>Of the 13 plug-ins I use for this site, I removed two after upgrading.
<a title="MT-Blacklist: The collective deep breath" href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2004/05/the_collective_deep_breath">MT-Blacklist is not compatible with MT3.0</a>, so I am removing comment spammers by hand again.</p>

<p>The Optional-Redirect plug-in is not necessary anymore, since <a title="David Raynes: Optional-Redirect is of no use in MT 3.0" href="http://www.rayners.org/2004/05/17/optionalredirect_is_of_no_use_in_mt_30.php">the same can be achieved in MT 3.0</a> by <code>no_redirect=&ldquo;1&rdquo;</code>.</p>

<p>All other plug-ins work the same way as before.</p>

<p><strong>Individual Archive template</strong></p>

<p>Most of my time went into trying to adjust the individual archive template. There have been many changes to this template to incorporate the TypeKey service, but I have not yet been able to get them to work when served as XHTML 1.1 with MIME type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. The smallest problem was to validate the template as XHTML 1.1. The new code uses some <code>name</code>s, which I changed into <code>id</code>s, and I had to edit <code>lib/MT/Template/Context.pm</code> so it won&rsquo;t use <code>valign</code> and <code>border</code> anymore &ndash; look at line 1476.</p>

<p>A bigger problem is the JavaScript. Things like <code>document.comments_form.email.value</code> is easy enough changed into <code>document.getElementById(&lsquo;email&rsquo;).value</code>, but I don&rsquo;t know how to fix <code>document.write</code> so it works both on <code>text/html</code> as on <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>

<p>The last problem I have with my template is that it shows the wrong comment form; the one that is normally used when TypeKey authentication is obligatory. I still have to find out what is going wrong here.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/05/16/internet-radar.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2004-05-16 17:33:47 &#43;0100">May 16, 2004</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The radar is a handy and necessary tool in the aviation business. A long time ago, when there was not much trafic, there was no need for a radar; for the people in the control towers it was enough to have visual contact with the airplane the moment it arrived. But as trafic increased more sophisticated systems were needed. Nowadays all incoming and outgoing planes appear on the radar screens, unless they fly too low.</p>

<p>Exactly the same is happening on the internet. Ten years ago, it was easy enough to <em>surf</em> the few interesting sites on a weekly basis. But as the internet grew and more sites started to publish more material, this became a kludge. I am interested in the content of about 100 sites, which I try to read on a regulary basis. Some of these sites publish daily news, some of them are only updated once a month. Four years ago I had my bookmarks ordered by update frequency: I had a folder called &lsquo;daily&rsquo; which contained sites I tried to visit on daily basis, etc. But as the number of sites increased, it became undoable to keep on visiting all those sites.</p>

<p>So I started using the internet equivalent of the radar: feed readers. Most sites publish their content in several formats. Besides the usual HTML pages, many sites also publish their news in a short format as RSS or Atom. My feed reader fetches those so-called feeds every X minutes, and notifies me when a site has been updated. This saves me a lot of time! But there are still many sites <em>flying under the radar</em>. Sites that do not provide feeds, sites which I still have to visit manually, many times only to find out that nothing has changed. I found out that I am visiting these sites less and less. They are about to dissapear from my screen, I simply do not have the time to keep on visiting them.</p>

<p>And I am not the only one. Many people read the texts of this site through a feed reader, and even more use <a title="Brain tags: RSS Syndication" href="/about/rss_syndication/">my feeds</a> to see whether I updated my site. So webmasters: don&rsquo;t fly under the radar, but give your readers the option to use feed readers!</p>

         	<p>One of the additions to Movable Type is a news box in the main menu of the main menu. This box syndicates the latest news from the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type site</a>, and has a prominent position on the top right of the screen.</p>

<p>I prefer to read syndicated content through my <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">news reader</a>, and this news box simply irritates me. So I searched through the files and removed the responsible code. In case you want to do the same: you&rsquo;ll need to edit the file <code>tmpl/cms/list_blog.tmpl</code>, and remove lines 7-13 (starting with <code>&amp;lt;div class=&ldquo;news-box&rdquo;&amp;gt;</code>).</p>

         	<p>I have upgraded to <a title="Guide to the new features in Movable Type 3.0" href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mt30.html">Movable Type 3.0</a>, and am trying to fix the templates at the moment. During the next days, posting comments might give some problems, but I am working on it.</p>

<p>On the web a lot of people complain about the new licences, but I haven&rsquo;t got any problems with it. As this site uses only three webblogs &ndash;the main site, the photo site and one for static content&ndash; and has only one author &ndash;that&rsquo;s me :-D&ndash;, I fall exactly within the limits of the free licence. And if I really need more, I have no problem paying for it. Let&rsquo;s face it, they made a far better CMS than I will ever be able to make myself.</p>

<p>The installation went without any problems, the pesky part is in the Individual Archive templates. There have been many changes, and I will have to go through my code line-by-line to see what I have to change.</p>

<p><del>To make it even more difficult, they did not escape ampersands in their code! The same thing happened in their 2.66 update, and I really expected that they&rsquo;d learned something. Anyway, soon I expect version 3.01, which fixes these errors in the JavaScript.</del></p>

<p>Another problem I ran into is their use of JavaScript as: <code>document.comments_form.email.value = getCookie(&ldquo;mtcmtmail&rdquo;);</code>, which typically won&rsquo;t work in documents served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. I have to change all these lines to use the <code>document.getElementById</code> function.</p>

<p>You notice: work enough to do, so I&rsquo;ll better get back into debugging mode.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.05.17]</strong>: They did escape ampersands, but that I was using the wrong version of their code.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>There is a law that is valid on both the internet as on every school yard: how important you are depends on who your friends are. Nowadays on the internet, your importance is expressed as PageRank. PageRank is a number between 0 and 10, calculated in a very secret way, but based on the amount of links to your site and the PageRank of the sites linking to you. If you own a site with a high PageRank (8+) you can earn a lot of money by simply putting a link to other sites on your homepage.</p>

<p>Knowing this, I wondered how popular I am. What is the PageRank of this site, where on the internet popularity scale am I. I looked it up, and found that I am exactly in the middle; I have a PageRank of 5/10. I am not the most popular guy on the school yard, but neither a looser without any friends.</p>

<p>This made me wonder what I had to do to get a 6. What kind of sites have a 6? And a 7? So I visited some sites from my bookmarks and made a short list with example sites for each PageRank:</p>

<table summary="Examples of sites per PageRank">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>PageRank</th>
<th>Example site</th>

<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a></td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td><a href="http://jnharmelen.nl/">Jong Nederland Harmelen</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>It was quite difficult to find sites with PageRank 1 and 2. Most sites I found have a PageRank of 3 and 4. Most popular sites reside at PageRank 8. Jong Nederland Harmelen obviously did something very wrong, since Google punishes them hard for not letting the GoogleBot spider their site.</p>

         	<p>Here is a short manual on finding products and services on the internet. I found this method when I was looking for <a title="Brain Tags: SyncML" href="/archives/2004/05/syncml/">SyncML servers</a>. A quick google on several keyword combinations did not result in the product I was looking for, but using the method described below I found what I wanted:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write down exactly what you are looking for, and why you are looking for it;</li>
<li>Publish your writings on the internet, and make sure your page uses <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google AdSense</a>;</li>
<li>Wait a day, and visit your page. Notice the advertisements placed by AdSense;</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>

<p>Why does AdSense give better results than a normal search? I guess the reason is that AdSense works in a reverse way. In a normal search I enter a few keywords, and the engine returns me a zillion of results. AdSense analyses the whole text, and returns only a few results. Of course I tried to paste the whole text in a normal Google search, but I found out that Google has a limit of only 10 keywords. Another reason for the better performance is that AdSense has a very limited database, containing almost exclusively commercial products and services.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> is a great internet browser, and I just love tabbed browsing. Each day I look in <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> to see which sites have been updated, and I open up all interesting reading matter in new tabs — I CRTL-click more than I click. After that I go one by one through my tabs, reading each page and opening interesting links in new tabs. I continue doing so until I have closed all my tabs, or until I run out of time, in which case I simply bookmark all open tabs. The good thing about loading pages on tabs it that I can load many pages before I read them; each time I close a tab, I find a new page waiting for me.</p>

<p>But there is one thing that annoys me. As you might know, I am very interested in web design, and many sites I read are about standards web design. Therefore, more and more sites I visit are standards compliant: clean HTML and designed with CSS. In my opinion Firefox does not handle these sites correctly, since it only starts loading background images the moment I focus on a tab. Thus many times I close a tab, I am confronted with an almost white page with some text on it, which then is converted little by little in a beautiful design. I do not understand why Firefox waits until I focus on the tab and does not pre-load the background images while I am reading other sites.</p>

<p>Or is there some hidden configuration option I don&rsquo;t know about?</p>

         	<p>SyncML is an XML standard for synchronizing data between devices. The most common use for it is to create back-up copies of your cellphone data, or even synchronise it with your desktop PIM.</p>

<p>I want that too! The user manual of my phone describes how I can set up synchronisation to store a copy my data on the Siemens web site. But…. it did not work. After looking in every corner of the Siemens site, I came to the conclusion that they only support SyncML for some countries, and Spain is not one of them. Also on the site of my provider Movistar I could not find anything about SyncML.</p>

<p>In the mean time I read a little bit more about <a title="Open Mobile Alliance" href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/affiliates/syncml/syncmlindex.html">SyncML</a>, and came to the conclusion that it is a very simple XML based protocol. Besides that, I figured that the average cellphone has a maximum 5Mb of data, so it must be very cheap to set up a SyncML server. My friend Google showed me <a title="Mighty Phone" href="http://www.mightyphone.com/">some</a> <a title="Freeserve Phonesync" href="http://phonesync.freeserve.com/">companies</a> offering SyncML accounts, but they charge the same amount that I pay for hosting this whole site!!!</p>

<p>Mmm, maybe I can find some software that I can install on my own server. Once again I asked my friend Google, and he offered me two solutions: <a href="http://www.sync4j.org/">Sync4j</a> is a Java based solution, which requires setting up a Java server (JBoss or Tomcat). I run Apache, and I prefer to use a solution that also uses Apache.</p>

<p>The <a title="SyncML Tools" href="http://nicolas.bougues.net/syncml/">second option</a> is a PHP solution with a mySQL back-end. That sounds a lot better! I quickly set up the database and installed the script. But my phone could not synchronize. :-( I assume that my phone uses the binary WBXML format, which is not yet supported by the script&hellip;</p>

<p>What next?</p>

It is a pitty that they do not support notes and tasks yet, but at least I can backup my address book. Now all I have to do is find a SyncML plug-in for Palm Desktop, and I will be the happiest mobile user in the world!</p>

         	<p>Since September of last year, this site is also available in WAP format at <a title="Brain Tags in WAP" href="http://wap.braintags.com/"><a href="http://wap.braintags.com/">http://wap.braintags.com/</a></a>. As you might imagine, there are not many people using this feature, I guess only 2-5 visitors per day.</p>

<p>With my <a title="Brain Tags: M55" href="/archives/2004/04/m55/">new phone</a> I also had a look at this site over WAP, and ran into an error. Clearly the template I was using was not OK. I made this template myself, because at the time I could not find a suitable template on the internet.</p>

<p>I decided to search again, and found <a title="Symbian Diaries: Building a Better Wap Diary" href="http://www.symbiandiaries.com/archives/symbiandiaries/000386.html">Building a Better Wap Diary</a> describing how to set up a WAP site with individual archives. This sounded interesting, since until now I published the last X items in a single file, without the possibility to view archived posts.
I quickly set to work, using the provided templates as the base for my own styled pages. I checked the result on two different phones and on a <a href="http://www.inetis.com/ttemulator.asp">WAP emulator</a> on the internet, and it looked alright on all of them. The new WAP site is better in three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The index page contains only the titles of the last entries. Before it contained also the full texts. Therefore, the index will load much faster;</li>
<li>Now all texts are available, in stead of only the latest ones. I only have to wait for Google to pass by, and I expect an increase in the number of visitors;</li>
<li>I also included the comments and trackbacks in the individual archives.</li>

<p>It looks like I&rsquo;ll have to use my surname <strong>Sangers</strong> more on this blog, and somehow I&rsquo;ll have to convince Google that I <em>am</em> an important Jeroen. Excite obviously does not like me.</p>

         	<p>Do you recognise this:</p>

<p>You are at your office, browsing the internet to solve a specific problem. You open some pages looking for the right clue, and suddenly you see an interesting story, explaining how you can manipulate HotMail to send passwords of other users to you. It is not related to your current search, but you would like to read it over quietly at home — you already imagine using this trick to fool some friends who stubbornly keep on using HotMail…</p>

<p>What I always did in these situations was send the URL by e-mail to my personal e-mail address. Other people post them on their site, and use Google to retrieve them, but I am not that advanced yet.</p>

<p>Anyways, I haven&rsquo;t been satisfied with this solution for a while, so I was full of joy when I found the <a href="http://cgi29.plala.or.jp/~mozzarel/addon/firefox/bookmarksftp/bookmarksftp.xpi">Bookmarks Synchronizer</a> for FireFox. I configured this little add-on to grab a file from my FTP server when starting FireFox, and to write the changes to this file when closing FireFox. Now I only have to maintain one single bookmarks file, which I can use at all my computers!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Yesterday <a title="M55" href="/archives/2004/04/m55/">I wrote about some usability problems with cellphones</a>. As I am exploring the functionality of my new phone, I have run into some more small usability problems.</p>

<p>Yesterday I already wrote about the fast access button asking for a confirmation. The reason they did this was probably to provide the user with an easy way to configure the fast access buttons. The moment I use the fast access button, a screen appears asking me whether I want to start the selected function or whether I want to modify the function linked to the button. Though in general it is handy to have the configuration option close to the functionality, in this case it definitely gets in the way. If I have to confirm the action each time I use the fast access button, the access won&rsquo;t be that fast anymore!</p>

<p>Another thing bothering me with many phones is the hassle I have to go through to send a SMS message. After writing the message, I have to go through the following steps to send it to somebody from my phone list:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first screen asks me directly to enter the phone number to send the message to. Since I (and usually many other people) only send messages to people from my address list, I press the fast access button that brings me to my address list;</li>
<li>In the address list, I search or browse to find the right person and press <em>Select</em>;</li>
<li>If I have stored more than one phone number for this person, the phone lets me choose the number I want. Icons show which kind of phone it is;</li>
<li>The chosen number appears again for verification. Since I am not so good in remembering phone numbers, I always choose <em>OK</em> here;</li>
<li>Finally, the message is being sent…</li>
</ol>

<p>Usually I need a minimum of 7 key-presses to send my message. If you compare that with how easy it is to write the message —T9 is great—, you can only come to the conclusion that something is going wrong here.</p>

<p>Maybe this set-up is useful for some people, but I assume that most people are like me, and almost always send messages to people from the phone list. In my opinion, the procedure should be the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first thing to show should be the phone list. If I want to manually enter a number, I can use a fast access key;</li>
<li>After selecting the name from the list, <strong>I</strong> would like that the message is immediately sent to the number listed in the <em>mobile</em> field of that persons details. I can imagine that some people would like to see all numbers for that person to choose from, but for me that won't be necessary. They could make this configurable;</li>
<li>After that, the message is being sent...</li>
</ol>

         	<p>Got it!!!</p>

<p>This weekend I finally got some time to walk to the shop and buy a new cellphone. They girl helping me wanted to show me many models, but I interrupted her to tell her first my criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>A good price</li>
<li>Small size (I usually wear my cellphone in the pockets of my trousers)</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
</ol>

<p>My first criteria limited the selection to those models for which my provider had an offer. Of these I could immediately remove all camera phones, smart phones, and big old models which left me with 3 phones to choose from (I don&rsquo;t remember which were the other two). This brought me to my third criterion, usability. The girl told me that all phones are equally easy to use, which made me shock in horror, since most phones have major usability problems! And each generation of phones gets more features and thus more horrible usability decisions are made.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/78bf602bbc.png" width="130" height="238" alt="Siemens M55" /></p>

<p>After trying out the three models a little bit, I decided to go for the <a href="http://www.my-siemens.com/m55">Siemens M55</a>, even though it had a big usability problem popping up immediately: on the main screen two fast access buttons are shown: &lsquo;menu&rsquo; on the right, and a book icon on the left. I expected that the book icon would directly open up my address book, but to my horror a confirmation screen appeared, on which I had to select &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to open my address book. Of course the people in the shop could not explain me why I had to press the button twice to open up a basic function as the address book.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a cellphone again and still many hours to go to find out how things work.</p>

         	<p>Sometimes people ask me whether there are certain Dutch products I miss here in Lleida. The answer is: “No, I don&rsquo;t miss anything, since I am often enough in Holland to do some shoppings.”</p>

<p>Most people can guess the most obvious items from my Dutch shopping list (Cheese &amp; Dropjes), but there are some things which are not so obvious. Last weekend Berry and Manon told us several times that they would have brought it if they would have known it.</p>

<p>So for all my future visitors from Holland, here is our Dutch shopping list:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jonge kaas</li>
<li>Dropjes (zacht zoet)</li>
<li>Chicken Tonight</li>
<li>Mix voor lasagne</li>
<li>Cup-a-Soup Tomaat (Toscaans of Chinees geen bezwaar)</li>
<li>Tijgernootjes</li>
<li>Hagelslag</li>
<li>Pepernoten (alleen in november en december uiteraard)</li>
<li>Chocoladeletters (eveneens alleen in november en december)</li>
<li>Brylcream (hier zijn ze zo modern dat ze alleen nog maar gel en wax hebben)</li>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last weekend Berry &amp; Manon visited us. The good thing about people spending their holiday with us, is that we also get a little bit the &lsquo;holiday feeling&rsquo;. Normally we use part of the weekend to clean the house, do some shopping and work in the house, but now we did all this during the days before. So we had all the time to relax!
On Friday evening we welcomed our guest with a beer, after which we ate a little bit. This to initiate them to the Catalan culture of spending a lot of time eating and drinking, usually a few hours later than they do in Holland &ndash; we had supper at 23:00.
Saturday morning was a typical vacation morning. After sleeping a bit longer than usual, taking a shower and having a long breakfast, the morning was over. Time to head over to the city centre to take a beer on a terrace! Back home we had a long lunch and a short sleep (siesta!). When it started to become dark we walked outside to do some window shopping and compare the prices with those in Holland. In the evening Berry and I went to see a Basketball match, while Manon and Maria José had some tapas. We finished the day in a fine restaurant.
After so much eating and drinking, we decided to have a slightly more active day on Sunday. The morning was the same as on Saturday, but after that we took the car to visit Montserrat and Sitges. At the end of the day we left them in front of a hotel in the middle of the Ramblas of Barcelona, so they would not have to travel a lot on Monday.
Berry and Manon: thanks for getting us to relax!</p>

         	<p>The only shops open in the morning when I wake up are bakeries and kiosks. I like that, since many days I go downstairs to buy some fresh bread for breakfast, once in a while accompanied with a newspaper.
When I come home from my work, almost all shops are closed. I don&rsquo;t like that, since many days I need something, and I will have to wait until Saturday to buy it. Or better: I&rsquo;ll have to wait for the first Saturday on which I have time. Sometimes I work on Saturdays, sometimes I am in Holland on Saturdays, sometimes we have visitors on Saturdays, and sometimes I have to buy more important things on Saturdays&hellip;
This Saturday I hope to have some time to do some shopping, but am afraid that once again I won&rsquo;t have the time for it. I want to bring my suit to the chemical cleaner, I want to develop the pictures we made in Easter, and I want to buy a new cellphone. And as a true gadget freak, it itches to know that you really need a new gadget (my old phone is completely destroyed), and probably won&rsquo;t have the time to buy it! :-(</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the problems of using the XHTML 1.1 doctype is the fact that your pages need to be completely valid in order to be displayed. If there is one single error in the XHTML code, the browser will display an error message. This in difference with HTML and XHTML 1.0 pages, which browsers will try to show even if the code contains errors.
Of course, all my templates contain valid code, but the problem comes when I or my commenters use code in my texts. It is always the parts that are not automated where the problems appear :-(
The number one error screwing up my valid pages is the use of ampersands (<code>&amp;amp;</code>). Since ampersands have a special meaning in XHTML, you&rsquo;ll have to enter the <em>entity code</em> <code>&amp;amp;</code> to display an ampersand.
In my texts I don&rsquo;t use many ampersands, but many URL´s do contain ampersands. And usually URL&rsquo;s are simply copied and pasted from the browser address bar, without verifying the address, resulting in an error message instead of a link.
But now I hope I solved this problem. I just installed the <a title="SafeHref.pl" href="http://www.intertwingly.net/stories/2004/04/01/SafeHref.pl">latest version</a> of the <a href="http://www.estey.com/mt/index.cgi?SafeHref">SafeHref plugin</a>, which automagically repairs this error.</p>

         	<p>Now that I am back home again and took some time to catch some sleep, it&rsquo;s time to tell about the CeBIT experience. It was my first time at the biggest technology fair in the world, and the first time ICG was present with their own stand. Therefore I did not really know what to expect. I assumed to see many new things, but not in the area where we have our stand. The POS world is a niche market after all.
Since we never did this before, we did not spend huge amounts of money on the stand. We simply ordered a basic stand and transported all other materials ourselves. That meant that we spent two days on the <span xml:lang="fr">autoroutes</span> and <span xml:lang="de">autobahn</span> and one day constructing the stand. As a result, we were already tired before the show started, and looked very jealously at all consultants freshly arriving at the Microsoft stand and finding their cup of coffee already prepared.
Like I already said, our stand was situated in a specialized POS corner, so the big public did probably not pass our stand. However, the people walking around in that particular section were exactly the people we wanted to talk to. We made many good contacts, and we have very good hopes on a good number of dealer wanting to distribute our software.
What surprised us was the change in visitor types by day. On the first two days (Thursday and Friday), the audience was very international. We attended people from all over the world, but did not see many Germans. In the weekend, many students and families visited the show, which did not bring us many contacts. Monday and Tuesday suddenly the Germans and Dutch showed up, while the foreigners seemed to have gone home. On Wednesday the only visitors to the show were some teenagers begging for goodies, so it was very quiet. This made the Wednesday a perfect day to visit other exhibitors, and they also visited us.
What I really missed at the CeBIT was the new technology buzz. I did not notice any excitement, did not see a single new gadget. It was even very difficult to get internet access. I expected it to be a lot more on the forefront of technology.</p>

         	<p>The last week we have worked very hard. Not only to prepare for the <a href="http://www.cebit.de/">CeBIT</a>, but also to do our regular work and the work that we normally should have done the next two weeks.
Now, we&rsquo;re almost there. Tomorrow we will load the truck with all material for the stand, and Monday morning we will drive to Germany. After two days of travelling we&rsquo;ll have a day to construct everything and then&hellip; let the show begin! I don&rsquo;t know what exactly we can expect but I am convinced that the show will be a big success for our company.
I will tell you more in two weeks, when I&rsquo;m back.</p>

         	<p>Out of respect for the victims and out of protest towards terrorism, today I put my site on black.</p>

<p>What happened this morning in Madrid is inhuman and cannot be justified. I can only guess for the reasons behind this horrible deed, but know that whatever they were trying to reach is not going to happen, in contrary.</p>

<p>If they wanted to put political parties up against each other, they failed, since all parties now form one front against terrorism.</p>

<p>If they wanted to show their strength, they will fail, since the government (whoever will win the elections the coming weekend) will be very convinced in finding the people behind this attack.</p>

<p>I cincerely hope that the Spanish government does the right thing as a reaction to the events today, without limiting the rights of the Spanish inhabitants.</p>

         	<p>Today it is raining in Lleida. So what? Well, the problem is that the people over here are not used to rain. When it is raining, the people simply stay inside until the rain is over.</p>

<p>When I drove this morning past the market square, I could see all merchants waiting inside their cars, still packed. They were waiting for the rain to stop, because their clients won&rsquo;t show up when it is raining. I was imagining that Dutch merchants would have the same mentality; they would only be able to sell during some weeks in summer! But that is mainly because the Dutch clients are used to the rain; they simply <em>have</em> to.</p>

<p>Of course there are situations in which even the Dutch people stay at home, and the amount of snow today created such a situation. The Dutch only stay at home when it is impossible to get out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my parents have to catch a flight to Barcelona in a few hours, so at this moment they are desperately trying to get to the airport. I just checked the news, but there are no trains going to Amsterdam and there are huge traffic jams on all highways. I really hope they are able to make it in time!!! 😱</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.02.26]</strong>: They managed to get to Schiphol airport by train, and I assume they have arrived safely in Barcelona. Just a few hours more, and I will meet them. 😉</p>

         	<p>Today I received the following message in my mailbox:</p>

<blockquote>an improper scan has caused a ban on your site

<p>I regulary receive this kind of messages, usually created because bad robots or script kiddies access my spam trap. But Yahoo and Overture are well respected companies, and I would assume that they would have respected my <code>robots.txt</code> file, in which I explicitly deny access to the <code>/private</code> folder:</p>

<blockquote>User-agent: *

<p>So I looked in my access log and found that they indeed violated my robots file!!</p>

<blockquote>66.77.73.32 - - [24/Feb/2004:17:20:24 -0500] "GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.0" 200 758 "-" "Yahoo-VerticalCrawler-FormerWebCrawler/3.9 crawler at trd dot overture dot com; http://www.alltheweb.com/help/webmaster/crawler"

<p>Notice that the page mentioned in the User Agent string states that Yahoo-Overture <em>does</em> support the robots exclusion protocol!</p>

That is an awfully big gray area!!! I guess I still have some traveling to do 😀</p>

<p>Notice that a holiday in a small part of the US of A made a big difference, since the whole country is marked red after visiting only 2 states:
<img src="http://www.world66.com/myworld66/visitedStates/statemap?visited=ORWA" alt="Map of the USA states I have visited" />
The fastest way to fill my map would be to make some strategical visits to Canada, Russia, Greenland, Brazil or China.</p>

<p>The other way would be to go for the biggest number of countries, and in that case traveling through Europe is the way to go:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Sometimes people ask me why this site is called ‘Brain Tags’.</p>

<p>Well, the origin comes from a nice song of Bettie Serveert called Brain Tag. Of course the word <em>Tag</em> links nicely to my interest in web development, while people knowing me only a little bit realise that the word <em>Brain</em> has no link to me at all…</p>

<blockquote>How does this rhyme, cause every time I see you
well, I could swear, must've met you somewhere
Down under lock and key,
there's a brain-tag to every secret
If I could keep my mind shut,
there's a chance that I might even keep it
You feel familiar and I wanna feel some more
Have I ever laid my hands on you before
This must sound weird, it's like you peered inside me
cause every time, you recognise my state of mind
Down under lock and key,
we put a brain-tag to every secret
Now comes the time to figure out
whether we should keep it
You feel familiar and I wanna feel some more
Have I ever laid my hands on you before
Total freedom beneath the waves
Floating through the arcane waves
Synchronised in space and time
Leaving all desire behind</blockquote>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2004/01/28/mt-does-not.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2004-01-28 11:33:59 &#43;0100">Jan 28, 2004</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When entering a comment in a <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> powered site, a radio button is available telling you that it is going to ‘Remember personal info’. However, sometimes when you come back to the same site and want to write another comment, all fields are empty. Your personal info has not been saved… 🙁</p>

<p>The problem I described above appears regularly on the <a href="http://movabletype.org/support/">Movable Type support forum</a>, and since the answer is always the same, I created this explanation, so I only have to point here to answer the question.</p>

<p>First a small explanation on how the system is supposed to work. If you enter a comment and select the ‘Remember personal info’ radio button, your name, address and URL are stored in a so-called cookie on your computer. This cookie contains the domain of the site, the directory for which the cookie is valid, an expiration date, and of course the stored value. For example, if I post a comment on an entry of this site, a cookie with the name mtcmdhome will be created with the following information:</p>

<blockquote>Name: <code>mtcmdhome</code>
Content: <code>http%3A//example.com/</code>
Domain: <code>.jeroensangers.com</code>
Path: <code>/</code>
Expires: <code>28-01-2005</code>

</blockquote>

<p>This will make sure that the URL I entered (<code><a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a></code>) will be stored for one year, and can be used by any page on the <code>.jeroensangers.com</code> sites.</p>

<p>MT sets this cookie using JavaScript, which you can find in the <a href="http://movabletype.org/default_templates.shtml#individual_entry_archive">Individual Entry Archive</a> template. You can find this script at line 29 of the default template.</p>

<p>By default, the script does not specify a path for the cookie, so that the cookie is stored using the path of the individual entry page. So the cookie of this page would only be valid for pages in <code>/2004/01/mt_does_not_remember_personal_info</code>, which is only one page. Since the cookie is not valid for my other pages, the details I filled in when commenting on this page won&rsquo;t show up in other pages. Note that the default MT installation places all archives in a single directory (e.g. <code>/archives</code>), so this problem does not appear.</p>

<p>If you do place your archives into different directories, you&rsquo;ll have to need to adjust the JavaScript in the template to fit your situation. The key is that you need to specify the directory for the cookie depending on the set-up of your site. If you have your own domain like I have, you can set it to ‘<code>/</code>’ to be valid for the whole domain. If you use a directory on the domain of your provider (e.g. <code><a href="http://example.com/username/">http://example.com/username/</a></code>), you can set it to ‘<code>/username</code>’.</p>

<p>To set the directory for the cookies, edit the functions <code>rememberMe</code> and <code>forgetMe</code> in your template. The location for the path has to be inserted between the two apostrophes before <code>HOST</code>. The original code is:</p>

<blockquote>function rememberMe (f) {
var now = new Date();
fixDate(now);
now.setTime(now.getTime() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
setCookie('mtcmtauth', f.author.value, now, '', HOST, '');
setCookie('mtcmtmail', f.email.value, now, '', HOST, '');
setCookie('mtcmthome', f.url.value, now, '', HOST, '');
}
function forgetMe (f) {
deleteCookie('mtcmtmail', '', HOST);
deleteCookie('mtcmthome', '', HOST);
deleteCookie('mtcmtauth', '', HOST);
f.email.value = '';
f.author.value = '';
f.url.value = '';
}

</blockquote>

<p>The code for <code><a href="http://example.com/username/">http://example.com/username/</a></code> becomes:</p>

<blockquote>function rememberMe (f) {
var now = new Date();
fixDate(now);
now.setTime(now.getTime() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
setCookie('mtcmtauth', f.author.value, now, '/username', HOST, '');
setCookie('mtcmtmail', f.email.value, now, '/username', HOST, '');
setCookie('mtcmthome', f.url.value, now, '/username', HOST, '');
}
function forgetMe (f) {
deleteCookie('mtcmtmail', '/username', HOST);
deleteCookie('mtcmthome', '/username', HOST);
deleteCookie('mtcmtauth', '/username', HOST);
f.email.value = '';
f.author.value = '';
f.url.value = '';
}

</blockquote>

<p>After making these small changes, the cookie is valid for your whole site, and the details filled in when creating a comment show up on all the pages.</p>

<p>I am going to the <a href="http://www.cebit.de/">CeBIT</a>!</p>

<p>This year will be the first year that <a title="Iniciatives de Comunicaciones Geminis" href="http://www.icg.es/eng/">our company</a> will have a stand at Europe&rsquo;s biggest technology fair in Germany. And I can tell you that it takes a lot of work to organise everything.</p>

<p>As we are a do-it-ourselves shop, I&rsquo;ve had many meetings in which we were making sketches for the stand, writing texts for press announcements and thinking about all details involved in this project.</p>

<p>At this moment we are finishing the product catalogue, which is being translated into English and German. Our main interest is finding new European dealers for our software , but in case end-users visit our stand, we have some Dutch and German dealers present to help them with a complete solution.</p>

<p>We still have a lot of preparations to do, but I am sure that we will be able to make some impact over there. For those readers who are going to visit the CeBIT this year: you can find us in <strong>hall 1</strong>, at <strong>stand 7N8</strong>.</p>

         	<p>Today version 2.66 of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> has been released, which addresses amongs others some of the comment spam issues.</p>

<p>I installed the update, and wrote a test comment to see how it works, but the entry did not show up anymore. Mozilla told me that there was a XML parsing error, and since I am serving my pages as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, Moz did not parse the page at all. I quickly changed my server settings so that my pages are served as <code>text/html</code>, and looked into the code.</p>

<p>The problem is that MT is now using a proxy script to link to the sites mentioned in comments, so spammers do not receive any &lsquo;Google Karma&rsquo; by posting comments. The problem lies in the use of <code>&amp;</code> in the URL, while they should have used <code>&amp;amp;</code>. For example, a link to this site appears as:</p>

<p><code><a href="http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red">http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red</a><strong>&amp;</strong>u=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2F&rdquo;<code></code></code></p>

<p>while they should have used:</p>

<p><code><a href="http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red">http://jeroensangers.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cmts.cgi?__mode=red</a><strong>&amp;amp;</strong>u=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2F&rdquo;<code></code></code></p>

<p>I did a quick search in the new files, and found the error in the file <code>lib/MT/Template/Context.pm</code> at line 1189. Just add 4 characters, and MT produces valid HTML again.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2004.01.16]</strong>: <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> published MT version 2.661 to fix this problem.</p>

         	<p>After 7 years of intensive use, time has come to say goodbye to my old PC. It simply has too much technical problems: I assume problems with the power supply, the memory <strong>and</strong> the CPU! As a result, my screen freezes frequently, usually when I am using Microsoft software.</p>

<p>So last Saturday I took the step and ordered a new PC. Just like the one I have now it is a low-budget (€500) white label box, which I hope will also last the same number of years. The box I ordered has the following specifications:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Intel Celeron 2,4 MHz</li>
    <li>512Mb RAM</li>
    <li>80Gb Hard disk</li>

         	<p>As everybody knows, WAP is not the mobile killer protocol, nor will it ever be. However, it has its uses. I use it for example to consult my bank account when I&rsquo;m on the road.</p>

<p>For Telefonica,- the Spanish phone monopolist, WAP also has its uses, since they offer Emoción; WAP-based services of which some bring in some money for every minute it is used.</p>

<p>The thing I never understood is that they sell packages with modern phones like my T200 with <a title="Brain Tags: WAP configuration" href="/2003/06/wap_configuration/">badly configured WAP access</a>. If it doesn&rsquo;t work directly, many people won&rsquo;t try it again!</p>

<p>The case is that the phone comes preconfigured with WAP over GPRS, but to use GPRS you&rsquo;ll have to buy a separate contract or pre-paid card, which nobody does. But Telefonica finally got smart. Saturday, when I was taking a beer on a sunny terrace I suddenly noticed a new icon on my phone&rsquo;s screen; I had GPRS access!!!</p>

<p>Of course I immediately changed my WAP configuration and tried it out. I surfed around in WAP space a little, until I came to <a href="http://wap.braintags.com/">my own WML feed</a>, which failed miserably. One more point on my todo list…</p>

<p>I am absolutely sure that this year is going to be a fabulous year. And with a new year come resolutions. Now I think that this is something crazy, because you can make your resolutions any day you want, and don&rsquo;t have to wait for new year. The past period I made some resolutions in my mind and already started working on some, but nevertheless I will post them today:</p>

<ul>
    <li>learn to speak Spanish;</li>
    <li>say “ja”;</li>
    <li>call old friends;</li>
    <li>finish work in the house;</li>
    <li>be less afraid of risks;</li>
    <li>think about the future;</li>
    <li>spend more time in the nature;</li>
    <li><ins>learn to program in python.</ins></li>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A while ago I mentioned <a href="http://globalmoxie.com/">Big Medium</a> as a possible CMS for the <a href="http://fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a> site. Today I finally had some time to lurk on the <a href="http://www.globalmoxie.com/cgi-bin/forums/ultimatebb.cgi">Support forum</a> to find answers to some of my questions. Already after reading only a few messages I found out that Big Medium is not what I was looking for. 🙁</p>

<ul>
    <li>The user interface of the produced site has some hard-coded English texts; so internationalisation (I18L) is out of the question;</li>
    <li>Big Medium only supports two document levels: the category and the subcategory. Only with an ugly hack it is possible to go deeper. This is also by design, and won't be solved in the near future;</li>
    <li>The text editing area is too much a ‘guestbook’ styled page and not enough a text processor. For use by people without any HTML knowledge it is absolutely necessary that the interface has the buttons to change the text properties (bold, italics, headers,…);</li>
    <li>There currently is no search feature; so I'll have to implement a separate search script. It is a big pity that you can't search directly in the BM database;</li>
    <li>To edit a document you'll have to go to the management interface and look up the document. I would prefer to have an ‘Edit’ button right on the page if my machine contains the BM cookie with the appropriate rights;</li>
    <li>Another thing I miss is the plug-in flexibility of Movable Type. Since BM does not support plug-ins, I'll have to wait for a new release to have extra functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the point mentioned above are on the <a href="http://www.globalmoxie.com/forums/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=3;t=000028">roadmap</a>, but in general I miss the flexibility of systems like MT.</p>

         	<p>Christmas is already finished, but I still would like to wish everybody a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year.</p>

<p>Even though we live far away from my family, we were able to spend Christmas with both families. On Christmas Eve we had a wonderful traditional Catalan family supper over here, and the day after we jumped in the airplane to celebrate a Dutch Christmas (I am not going to compare the two ways of celebrating; they do not differ that much and I like them both).</p>

<p>Anyway, as usual my time in Holland was way too short. I would have liked to spend more time with my family and friends and maybe visited some nice places together, but that will have to wait for my next visit. We have planned to go again with Easter, but maybe I will book another flight earlier.</p>

         	<p>I have a problem. Now that we are halfway in December, I would like to have some christmas decoration in our house.</p>

<p>But I found out that my taste is completely different from the taste of the people her. The trend seems to be many colours and a lot of blinking lights. In other sitiations I don&rsquo;t mind <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/blinkenlights.html">Blinkenlights</a> but I prefer that the lights in my christmas tree, which of course is not plastic, do not blink and have one one colour: white. I also don&rsquo;t want any decoration that plays music.</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to wait until I am in Holland again and do my shoppings for next year over there. Until that moment, our house will only have a little bit of Christmas decoration.</p>

         	<blockquote>There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbours came to visit. “Such bad luck,” they said sympathetically. “May be,” the farmer replied.

The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How wonderful,” the neighbours exclaimed. “May be,” replied the old man.

The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune. “May be,” answered the farmer.

The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out. “May be,” said the farmer.</blockquote>

<p>Now that I have been working with <a href="http://postneo.com/postwiki/moin.cgi/LoafHome">LOAF</a> for several days, I have the feeling that the technology is not completely finished yet. I have studied many <a title="Known LOAF implementations" href="http://postneo.com/postwiki/moin.cgi/KnownLoafImplementations">LOAF implementations</a>, but have the feeling that most implementations are just too difficult to implement.</p>

<p>A lot of implementations are written in obscure programming languages, and need a powerful server to run on. But this way the LOAF technology is kept away from the big audience, who know nothing about programming. In my opinion, LOAF should be more easy to use, Joe Sixpack should be able to use it on his blog. And that preferably by only changing a single setting in his weblogging software.</p>

<p>So, I decided to create a LOAF implementation in CSS. Notice that this stylesheet is XHTML1.1 ready, since it also styles the <code><html></code> element. You only need to copy the file to your server and your site is completely LOAF-compliant.</p>

<p>To use the LOAF CSS implementation on your site, follow the steps below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Download the <a href="http://braintags.com/images/loaf.css">LOAF CSS file</a>;</li>
    <li>Replace the stylesheet for your site with the contents of the file you just downloaded (MT users: read the <a href="http://movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_templates.html#default%20templates">instructions</a> on the Movable Type site).</li>
    <li>That's all!</li>

         	<p>The latest trick spammers have is setting up fake blogs, usually with the design copied from another site.</p>

<p>Though these sites look harmless, all links direct you to pr0n sites. To get visitors to their ‘webblogs’, they use a trick known as referrer spam. They request pages from other sites, pretending to come from a link on their weblog.</p>

<p>Since many sites display the referrers on one of their pages, home page or statistics page, the spammer effectively creates links to his site this way. And the more links to your site you have, the higher you get in Google&rsquo;s search results, which results automatically in more visitors!!! You can read more about all this at <a title="i d l y . o r g :: Porn Sites Hiding Behind Blogs" href="http://www.idly.org/2003/11/14/porn_sites_hiding_behind_blogs.php">idly.org</a>.</p>

<p>Even though I do not display my referrers, and Google does not spider <a title="AWStats statistics for braintags.com" href="/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com">my statistics</a>, I still don&rsquo;t want these spammers to use my site. So I blocked them based on the referer field by adding the following code to my <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<p><code>RewriteEngine on

<p>Just for the record: at this moment we have planned two short visits to Holland.</p>
<p>The first visit will be at X-mas time. We already have the tickets, and will stay in the cold part of Europe from December 25 until December 28.</p>
<p>In spring we plan to come at Easter time, probably from Friday 'til Monday. If everything goes alright, we'll bring some people from over here with us.</p>
<p>As usual, invitations for a coffee or a beer are very welcome, though I cannot guarantee that we will accept your offer; it is our holiday after all.</p>

         	<p>To be honest, there are not a lot of great concerts to visit in Lleida. The main reason is that Barcelona works as a huge magnet and has all the goodies. But for me 160 kilometres is too far away to do regularly on a mid week&rsquo;s evening.</p>

<p>But today finally I can see a <em>big</em> name in Lleida: <a title="The Official John Mayall Website" href="http://www.johnmayall.com/">John Mayall &amp; The Bluesbreakers</a>. For those who don&rsquo;t know John: he is mostly famous for having some great talent in his Bluesbreakers as Clapton and Jack Bruce (Cream), Peter Green, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood (Fleetwood Mac), Andy Fraser (Free), and Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones). Besides that he also knows quite well how to play the blues.</p>

<p>I am really looking forward to this concert, though he could have chosen a better concert hall than the <a href="http://wonder.lleida.com/">Wonder</a> mega disco outside the city. I prefer to listen my Chicago-style blues in a place with more atmosphere as the <a href="http://www.cafedelteatre.com/">Escorxador</a>.</p>

         	<p>Just when we were cooking our evening meal yesterday, we were suddenly without electricity.</p>

<p>“No problem”, I said to Maria José, since we have these handy earth leakage switches. I was able to find my small Jong Nederland torchlight in the dark, and went to the entrance to flip the guilty switch.</p>

<p>But all switches were in the correct position. I went outside our apartment to the stairs, and turned on the light; it switched on immediately. I noticed that our neighbours upstairs also had light, so the problem was definitely only in our apartment.</p>

<p>Then I noticed a box high on the walls in the stairs, with two cables coming from it, entering our apartment. I got some stairs, opened the box and found two old-fashioned fuses. One of them was clearly burned and still hot. Found it!</p>

<p>Now we had to find a replacement fuse. I remember having seen some when we were reconstructing our house, but I was very afraid that we threw them away, since we had our fuses replaced by those modern switches. A quick look around in the most easy accessible places did not deliver us the fuses. We started getting a little bit worried about the things in our fridge and, more important, our meal. While Maria José was getting ready to bring the contents of our fridge to our neighbours, I decided to check the closet downstairs one more time.</p>

<p>And there they were; two fuses of at least 20 years old. They had a little bit less capacity than the old ones, but at least they would get us through the night.</p>

<p>Today I checked two shops to buy new fuses, but so far I haven’t been lucky. Tomorrow I will contact an electrician, because in my eyes it is very ridiculous that we have these old fuses in front of our modern earth leakage switches, and I have a high suspicion that they are not necessary at all.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/11/11/email-disclaimers.html">E-mail disclaimers</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/11/11/email-disclaimers.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-11-11 20:46:06 &#43;0100">Nov 11, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>More and more mail I receive has some kind of legal disclaimer attached to it. And I am getting more and more annoyed by it. The typical disclaimer usually contains something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>This E-mail and any attachments are private, intended solely for the use of the addressee. If you are not the intended recipient, they have been sent to you in error: any use of information in them is strictly prohibited. Blah blah blah blah...
(<cite>Copied from the <a href="http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/list.html">List of Stupid EMail Disclaimers</a></cite>)</blockquote>

<p>So if I am not the intended recipient, this text tells me that I may not use the information in the e-mail. But I only know about these conditions when I am reading the disclaimer at the end of the message; too late. If you want to force these conditions on me, I&rsquo;ll have to accept them <em>before</em> reading the message, in the same way a licence is presented to me before I install software, right?</p>

<p>And imagine that I am not the intended recipient, why can&rsquo;t I use the information inside the message to find out who is the intended recipient and forward the message to this person? You clearly forbid this. The same rule also forbids me to tell the sender of his mistake.</p>

<p>Besides the kind of problems described above, such a statement should have no force of law. The sender can&rsquo;t in general unilaterally stipulate conditions on what the recipient may or may not do with the email. In specific cases, such as copyright, the author may, of course, stipulate what rights are granted to the recipient. There are other instances where there is an implied contract of confidentiality, but those are not created merely by the sender sticking the word ‘confidential’ on a message.</p>

<p>Just compare it to your communication on paper. Do you add a disclaimer to every memo you send out? I don&rsquo;t think so! So why on earth do you want to add this text to e-mail? Usually the answer is: “Because my boss told me to do it”. Your boss is of course worried about the consequences of your writings, which I can understand, and he thinks that this problem can be solved by adding a disclaimer. So to get rid of these useless disclaimers, we&rsquo;ll have to educate your boss.</p>

<p>Explain them the possible conflicts caused by disclaimers as I described above.</p>

<p>And tell them that the value of disclaimers is limited, since the courts normally attach more weight to the substantive content of the communication and the circumstances in which it is made than to any disclaimer.</p>

<p>The real solution to his problem cannot be obtained by technology or legal disclaimers.</p>

<p>The real solution is about the people, so train them! Most companies have special communication trainings for the phone support staff, why not do the same thing for those people communicating by e-mail? And of course you have customer relations guidelines for email, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>And if your boss is not listening to you, there is one more option: fight them with their own means! Each time I receive a message containing a disclaimer, I add the following disclaimer to my replies:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
By sending an email to ANY of my addresses you are agreeing that:
<ul>
    <li><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);background:var(--color-neutral-0);">I am by definition, ‘the intended recipient’</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);background:var(--color-neutral-0);">All information in the email is mine to do with as I see fit and make such financial profit, political mileage, or good joke as it lends itself to. In particular, I may quote it on the Internet.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);background:var(--color-neutral-0);">I may take the contents as representing the views of your company.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);background:var(--color-neutral-0);">This overrides any disclaimer or statement of confidentiality that may be included on your message.</span></li>
</ul>
(<cite>From <a href="news:bsNkZrASz6H8EwxC@yddraiggoch.demon.co.uk">a newsgroup article by John Sullivan</a></cite>)</blockquote>

<p>This disclaimer is just as ridiculous as any other disclaimer, and has no legal value. But it might show the uselessness of disclaimers to people using them.</p>

         	<p><a title="La piel contra la piedra" href="http://www.lapelotavasca.net/">La Pelota Vasca</a> is a documentary movie about the situation in the Basque Country.</p>

<p>In this movie, a lot of people involved with (both sides of) the situation like politicians, musicians, professors and victims are interviewed to give a view of how hopeless the situation is.</p>

<p>Two important groups are absent: the party currently governing Spain (PP) and the ETA; exactly the two groups who could make a difference in the situation.</p>

<p>I saw this movie last Saturday and was very impressed and decided to write about it on my site. But of course I did not have time for it, so I forgot it until I saw the news yesterday.</p>

<p>The PP has the opinion that the movie gives a one-sided view of the problem (mainly because they refused to participate in the first place), and is doing everything they can to prevent people from watching this movie.</p>

<p>So when this week a British film festival decided to show the movie, Spain withdrawed their yearly support for this festival to bring the festival into financial problems.</p>

<p>I was amazed to hear that a modern country which considers freedom of speech one of the basic human rights is trying to prevent British festival visitors from seeing another opinion than the government&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In the same news block I heard the news that the government refuses to talk with the governor of the Basque Country about his plans for a better relation between the central government and the autonomous regions.</p>

<p>So they do not only refuse his plans, but refuse to talk with him at all!!!! Once again, I cannot believe some of the things this government is doing, and getting away with.</p>

<p>If you ever get the chance to watch ‘La pelota vasca’, do it quickly. Though a little bit depressed, it certainly is worth your time. And you&rsquo;re teasing the Spanish government at the same time!!!</p>

<p>The problems started when the hosting provider for <a href="http://fimcap.org/">fimcap</a> had been taken over by another company, and the server migrated to a new platform. As a result, our scripts were broken, and SSI worked in another way, so we had to change the extension of all files. All in all a lot of work, which I still haven&rsquo;t completely finished.</p>

<p>Besides that, I can only download the access logs from a password protected site, almost impossible to automate. I have contacted the support desk many times, but answers are typically slow. Anyway, for the moment things are almost running as before again, but we will surely move to another provider after the current paid term expires.</p>

<p>While I was working hard to fix all the problems described above, the hard disk of my own computer started having problems. Each time after working for about half an hour, the disk started making an awful noise and the computer halted. After waiting an hour, I could start up the computer again for another thirty minutes of work.</p>

<p>In the cooling down period, I used my laptop computer, which also has some problems since I <a href="/2002/12/warning/">dropped it on the floor</a>. I cannot use it while the batteries are recharging, and the batteries only last for (again) thirty minutes.</p>

<p>You have to know that both computers are very old, my desktop is seven years old and my laptop probably 8. You could say that they are way too old, but I disagree.</p>

<p>My desktop with its Cyrix P133+ processor is more than fast enough for me, since all I do is read my e-mail, visit some web pages (no problem as long is you don&rsquo;t have Flash installed), and create HTML and CSS files.</p>

<p>Anyway, since I just bought a new computer for my in-laws, I took their old machine, took out the hard disk and started installing.</p>

<p>At this moment I have installed just the basics to start working again: Windows 98SE, Microsoft Office, HTML-kit, TopStyle Pro, WS_FTP Pro, Mozilla Firebird and Mozilla Thunderbird.</p>

<p>It is not ready yet, I still have to install Trillian, Acrobat Reader and Xenu Link Sleuth, and there is some more configuration to be done.</p>

<p>But at least I am working again. And after all, that&rsquo;s why I have a computer, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>How disappointed was I when I noticed that they use a fixed width for their pages, a really small font by default, a font colour that lacks contrast and that some parts of the text are rendered unreadable with the blue background instead of white. I don&rsquo;t know whether the last problem is a bug in Firebird or a coding problem, since it disappears when I reload the page.</p>

<p>Fortunately the content is much better than their new design!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Imagine that I would have a lot of spare time. And imagine that I still remember how to program applications, and know all the ins and outs of Perl, PHP or Python. Imagine all that…</p>

<p>If all that would be true, I would create a Content Management System. A CMS is an application in which you can enter your texts in a very easy manner, and after that the application does all sorts of things with permissions, rules and templates to create for example a web site and/or a PDF document.</p>

<p>One example of a CMS is <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, which I use to create this site. I only have to enter the text of my article, and MT creates a page with this text and a comment form, adds a summary to the main page, updates the monthly archive overview, etc.</p>

<p>MT is made especially for sites that post texts in a chronological order. There are also other types of CMS applications like <a href="http://mmbase.org/">MMBase</a> for multimedia content and <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a> for general content. There are many CMS systems out there, so why do I want to create another one?</p>

<p>Simple because the CMS I am looking for does not exist.
I am not looking for this site, I am perfectly happy with MT, but I am looking for a solution for the <a href="http://fimcap.org">Fimcap site</a>. This site is basically a collection or relatively statically documents, which are ordered in folders. Something very simple.</p>

<p>What I am looking for is a tool that gives the users a simple screen in which they can enter their text, and something to specify its location. After saving, the tool should automatically create the folders and add the new document in the navigation menus.</p>

<p>I know that there are some CMS applications that can do this, but I am looking for something very easy to configure and use, without spending months tweaking my application.</p>

<p>The best example I have is Microsoft FrontPage. Although it produces horrible code, they do have an easy way to manage your site with their organizational chart view. I only have to select the parent page, press the Insert button, change the name and start typing my text.</p>

<p>It is that way of working that I am looking for, only implemented as a server-based CMS system, so I can work from every computer. I also don&rsquo;t want to work in preview mode, but just enter my text in a text box with a limited set of buttons to add some basic mark-up (<a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>?). I can imagine starting from a sitemap page to enter new pages, or adding an ‘Edit’ and ‘Add new page’ button to pages when a user is logged in.</p>

<p>If this solution would be easy enough to set up, I can imagine that a lot of hobby sites, local clubs, churches and schools would start using it; in fact, everybody with a basic site made with FrontPage.</p>

<p>The template system could be set up like in Movable Type, specifying different templates for different types of content. Of course it would come with a basic set of predefined document types (agenda, product description, event, news,&hellip;) and several style sheets to choose from.</p>

<p>Yes, if I really had a lot of time and programming knowledge, I would create such a CMS. Or does it already exist????</p>

<p>I never added this kind of stuff to my site, untill I found <em>What Pixies song are you?</em> Of course, if they mention my favourite band, I&rsquo;ll have to do it:</p>

You're mysterious, picky, and a bit aloof. Some people say you have a very cheery personality, but it's hard to say because you mask your emotions behind dark pretenses. You enjoy watching obscure movies and going to plays, but by the end of the day you're usually too wound-up by the ironies of your life to relax.</blockquote>

<p>I just love numbers, and check the access statistics of my sites almost on a daily basis. Sometimes when I visit a site, I also check the statistics of that site. What kind of people are reading that site? Where do they come from? What were they looking for? All very interesting information…</p>
<p>My own visitors could not have a look behind the screens of this site, since my access statistics are located on the management control panel, safely protected by a password.</p>
<p>The application to generate these statistics is called <a title="Free log file analyzer for advanced statistics" href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AWStats</a>, which I was using already before I moved to my current hosting provider. Since I knew the structure of the application, I figured that it should be possible to install AWStats myself, and have my copy point to the data files that are generated automatically by my provider's copy of AWStats.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what I've done. I only needed to copy the main <code>awstats.pl</code> file, the <code>lib</code> directory and the <code>icons</code> directories, and could use the existing configuration file (after changing the <code>DirCgi</code> parameter) to have everything working.</p>
<p>So now everybody can <a title="Statistics of braintags.com" href="/cgi-bin/awstats/awstats.pl?config=braintags.com">check my access statistics</a>!!!</p>
<p>Maybe someday I will create an <em>About this site</em> page, on which I will put a permanent link to my statistics. Some people put this link on their home page, but in my opinion this feature is of no use to the general visitor, and only adds bloat to the home page.</p>

<p>There are many ways to keep contact with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>By far the best way is to meet them in a bar, drinking a beer together. Unfortunately, this is not always a viable solution, so I also make use of electronics to keep contact.</p>

<p>Number two on my list is the good ol&rsquo; phone, which has the benefit of meta-communication (emotions, emphasis,…) over the other electronic methods.</p>

<p>Then I use of course the internet to communicate, I am using e-mail (more personal), Usenet newsgroups (good for technical problems) and this site.</p>

<p>However, it might take a while before I receive feedback to the things I express using these media. Then we have the two I&rsquo;s: IRC and IM. The first I use when I have a technical problem that needs to be fixed urgently, the second for all personal communication for which using the telephone would be overkill.</p>

<p>Considering IM, at work I use Microsoft Messenger a lot. We have a lot of contacts abroad, and small companies are not able to hang on the phone to talk with the other side of the world for half the day.</p>

<p>Since we are basically a Microsoft shop, and most people have Messenger already installed on their machines, we are using this.</p>

<p>Personally, I am not a big fan of Messenger, mainly because you have no option of connecting without giving away your e-mail address. For business use this is no problem, but for my personal use, I prefer a solution that does not give away more than strictly necessary.</p>

<p>Until I moved to Spain I have been using <a href="http://icq.com/">ICQ</a> at home, and today I started using it again to be able to solve some problems on the fimcap site.</p>

<p>So back to ICQ! I installed the Lite version at home, and everywhere else I can use the web version. For those people who also use ICQ: my number is <a title="Add me to your contact list" href="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/search.dll?to=11807773">11807773</a>. Everybody else can use my <a title="Jeroen Sangers's Unified Messaging Center" href="http://wwp.icq.com/11807773">Messaging Center</a> to send me a message when I&rsquo;m on-line.</p>

<p>People using more modern browsers as Mozilla or Firebird might not have noticed this, since these advertisements are not visible for them.

<blockquote>Hello Jeroen,

The errors that you were experiencing last night were due to an AdSense system upgrade yesterday evening. This upgrade unfortunately created some technical difficulties and were temporarily unable to serve ads to sites in certain browsers. Not all browsers were effected.

However, our engineers have identified the problem, and I am happy to inform you that the issue is now resolved. Ads are now running on AdSense websites and you should not be seeing these errors anymore.

We value you as an AdSense publisher, and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused you. If you are continuing to have problems with this or have any other questions or concerns, please let us know by replying to this email. One of our AdSense specialists would be happy to assist you. Thank you for your patience in this matter.

<p>Of course I answered them that the problem still exists, but until now I haven&rsquo;t received an answer.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2003.09.26]</strong> Answer from Google:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Jeroen,

Thank you for writing us about this issue you are experiencing with your AdSense code. Unfortunately we are unable to replicate this problem. We taking your page, <a title="Braintags: application/xhtml+xml" href="/2003/08/applicationxhtmlxml/">http://braintags.com/archives/2003/08/applicationxhtmlxml/</a>, and running it through the W3C's XML validator tool ( http://validator.w3.org/), we find that the entire page including our JavaScript code is currently XML complaint. (See Results: <a title="Validation Results" href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%braintags.com%2Farchives%2F2003%2F08%2Fapplicationxhtmlxml%2F">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjeroensangers.com%2Farchives%2F2003%2F08%2Fapplicationxhtmlxml%2F</a>). Unfortunately we are unable to replicate this problem you are experiencing.

From previous emails it appears you state you are having this problem in Mozilla 1.4. Here is a list of browsers that supports our code <a title="Google AdSense - Technical Implementation Guidelines" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/faq-tech#q10">https://www.google.com/adsense/faq-tech#q10</a>. Are there other browsers on this list that you are having difficulty with? Also can you include a screenshot of the error since we are unable to replicate this problem on our end. Please include any additional information you may find may be useful in helping to resolve this issue.

Sincerely,

The Google Team</blockquote>

<p>It looks like they don&rsquo;t understand anything about specifying the MIME type when sending a page, so I send the following reply.</p>

<blockquote>Hello,

I know that my page is XML compliant, that surely is not the problem.

You have not been able to replicate the problem, because you have not used a gecko-based browser. Normally I send my pages with MIME type <code>text/html</code>. This is what IE and the W3C validator get. Only to browsers which tell me in their request headers that they accept the MIME type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> (like Mozilla and Firebird), I use this MIME type to send my files.

Note that even though the validator did not complain, I did not send it a valid page, since the specification tells that XHTML1.1 <em>should</em> be delivered as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.

To reproduce the error, just visit my page with Mozilla or Firebird, and you will see that the AdSense box will not appear. The only screenshot I can send you is the JavaScript console, but it only contains the two
messages I have send before.

Kind regards,

Jeroen Sangers</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Update 2003.10.01]</strong> And finally Google realises that their script is not working:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Jeroen,

We appreciate your taking the time to offer us this feedback and encourage you to continue to let us know how we can improve Google AdSense. As AdSense is still a young program, new features are under consideration and your feedback is very helpful. This information has been passed on to our engineers and they will look into allowing our ads to be served in <code>xhtml+xml</code> pages.

Sincerely,
The Google Team</blockquote>

<p>It took them almost a month (I reported this problem on September 4<sup>th</sup>) to realise that something is wrong. Let&rsquo;s see how long it will take them to fix this problem.</p>

         	<p>How could I have missed the news! One of my favourite bands is <a title="MTV.com - News -Legendary Pixies To Reunite For Tour, Album" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478034/20030909/pixies.jhtml?headlines=true">getting together again</a>.</p>

<p>Although the Pixies are not well-known by the general public, they have greatly influenced many big bands as Nirvana and the Distillers.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to see them perform life in Vredenburg, Utrecht during their Doolittle tour, and later have seen spin-offs Frank Black &amp; the Catholics and the Breeders; all very impressive concerts.</p>

<p>I surely hope that they will cross the Atlantic with their new tour.</p>

         	<p>So many things to do, and only 24 hours in a day. I guess everybody sometimes has the feeling that too many things lie around unfinished.</p>

<p>For me, these are some small, usually technical, things as fixing the stylesheet of this site so the menu appears on the right place in IE, converting this site to PHP (so I can <em>degrade</em> pages to XHTML1.0 for IE), fix the light in the stairway, reading hundreds of pages I have bookmarked lately, look for a new computer for my in-laws, build a wireless network at home, put the latest Link on the Fimcap site, paint our front door, learn how to use ZOPE for future use for Fimcap, install freeBSD on my laptop…</p>

<p>Looking at this list, I wonder where all my time is going. Lets see: 9 hours sleeping, 9 hours working, 1.5 hours household (cooking, cleaning, ironing), 2.5 quality time (hours drinking beers on a terrace, watching TV on the sofa, reading the newspaper), 1 hour taking care about myself (eating &amp; shower)… that leaves me 1 hour each day to be productive! I definitely need more hours in a day.</p>

         	<p>A good holiday is a holiday without internet connection. I had a <em>quite</em> good holiday, so you haven&rsquo;t read any news from me lately. I did connect to the internet once in a while, but that was only to fix the computer of my parents and to install Mozilla Firebird (if you&rsquo;re learning to surf the internet, you better do it right). I won&rsquo;t bother you with my holiday stories, since we didn&rsquo;t do that much. I was happy to see my friends and family again, and for those that I could not meet: sorry, maybe next time better.</p>

<p>For them moment I have plenty of things to arrange, so I won&rsquo;t fix the menu bar on this site to work with IE and probably I won&rsquo;t write a lot neither. That&rsquo;s all for the moment, I better continue processing my overly full inbox…</p>

         	<p>I use this site a lot for testing out things. You could say that this site is <em>Forever under construction</em>. Today I have been testing again, and as a result, it looks more horrible in Internet Explorer. And since I am going on holidays, I am not going to fix it until next week. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>I have been working on the menu. The whole page header is situated inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, with an inline ordered list with bottom border as menu. Until today, I did nothing to position the menu, which resulted that the menu walked outside the header if you changed the font size. Not too beautiful…</p>

<p>So today I relatively positioned the header, and specified an absolute position of the menu, so it is always at the border of the containing positioned element, the header.</p>

<p>It solves the problem perfectly, but not in IE. I tested the new stylesheet in IE6, and the menu appeared at the bottom of the screen instead of the bottom of the header. I don&rsquo;t know yet why IE is behaving like this, but promise to look further into it next week.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/09/02/semantically-incorrect.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-09-02 18:11:21 &#43;0100">Sep 2, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>If you are creating (X)HTML code, you always have to make sure that you use the right elements to specify the meaning of certain parts of the text. After that you can use stylesheets to determine how these parts will look. This is what they call the semantics of the text.</p>

<p>A lot of web designers abuse tags to accomplish a certain <em>look</em>. If they want a bigger text, they use the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> element, while the text is not a header at all, if they want to indent a text, they use <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, even though they are not quoting. I won&rsquo;t go into detail why this is a bad thing, there are plenty of resources explaining this better than I could.
But a lot of designers like me who try to do it correctly still make some mistakes. Today I realised that my pages have two semantically errors:</p>

<p>For my navigation lists, I use—as many other sites—unordered lists (<code>
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;XXX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>). But my navigation links <strong>do</strong> have an order! My archive links are ordered chronological, so the correct thing would be to use the ordered list (<code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;XXX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</code>) instead.</p>

<p>By default, an ordered list is shown with numbers in front of each item, but it is very easy to remove them, just as I removed the bullets from my unordered navigation lists. I have seen many sites doing this wrong, and most examples of you will find on internet also use unordered lists.</p>

<p>Another thing I thought about today is that when I display trackbacks (comments on another site about my text) I am quoting another site. Therefore, I should be using the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element (or <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>). I have looked around at other sites, but nowhere have I found trackbacks marked up as quotes.</p>

<p>You might think that these are minor issues, but since I am rewriting my templates anyway, I better do it right, not?</p>

         	<p>You might already have noticed it: I added some advertisements to this site.</p>

<p>Since now I am paying a hosting provider to host this site, I thought that I might try to get back at least some of the money I spend for it.</p>

<p>The advertisements are related to the contents of the page, so I only added them the pages of the individual items. This makes the chance bigger that they may actually be useful for my visitors as well.</p>

<p>I decided to give it a try for about two months; if I notice at that moment that they are not working, I will remove them.</p>

<p>People using a modern browser won&rsquo;t see the advertisements, since the advertisement script does not work when the page is processed ad XML.</p>

         	<p>One more week to go, and we have our second short vacation of this year!!!</p>

<p>After going to Croatia in July, we will visit the good ol&rsquo; Netherlands this time. From September 9 until 16 you will have a bigger than normal chance of seeing us in the north of Europe.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t make an exact planning of what we are going to do, but we have made two short lists.</p>

<p>One with some practical things I have to arrange, and one with some places we want to visit. The first list has to be followed, and the second list will almost surely change on a day-by-day basis.</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/08/29/applicationxhtmlxml.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-08-29 11:17:41 &#43;0100">Aug 29, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The moment I changed the <em>looks</em> of this site, I also changed the version of the code used for these pages.</p>

<p>My site is now made up in XHTML version 1.1. I only forgot to change one thing.</p>

<p>I did change some elements to their new variants, and of course I included the right DTD. But my pages were still served to your browser with the <code>text/html</code> MIME type, while the specification tells me that I <strong>should</strong> serve my pages as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>

<p>The specification is quite clear in this, but as usual the reality is more complicated. I could simple change the file extensions to <code>.xhtml</code>, which are automatically send with the right MIME type. But at this moment a lot of browsers (including IE6) are not able to handle this kind of documents.</p>

<p>So I need to distinguish browsers that can handle <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> from those that cannot handle it. Fortunately, most browsers send a list of MIME types they can handle each time they request a file from the server; so all I have to do is look at this list, and change the MIME type for modern browsers.</p>

<p>Therefore I added the following lines to my <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<p><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} application/xhtml&#043;xml
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} !application/xhtml&#043;xml\s<em>;\s</em>q=0
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} &#046;html$
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} HTTP/1&#046;1
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !photos.braintags.com
RewriteRule .* - [T=application/xhtml+xml]</code></p>

<p>The first line looks whether the MIME type is in the accepted list of the browser.</p>

<p>The second lines looks whether it does not have q=0 (q stands for quality), which means that the browser does not want to use this MIME type.</p>

<p>The third line limits the requests to .html files only, since we do not want to change the MIME type for images, stylesheets and other files.</p>

<p>The fourth line limits the requests to HTTP version 1.1.</p>

<p>The fifth line excludes my photo pages, since I haven&rsquo;t updated them to XHTML1.1 yet.</p>

<p>And the last line finally specifies the right MIME type for requests that satisfy all conditions above.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/08/27/http-error-length.html">HTTP Error 411: Length required</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/08/27/http-error-length.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-08-27 11:51:10 &#43;0100">Aug 27, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I noticed something strange in the access report of this site. In the error codes list I found error 411.</p>

<p>Since I haven&rsquo;t seen this error code before, I googled on internet for some more information.</p>

<p>The <a title="HTTP/1.1: Status Code Definitions" href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.12">official RFC 2616</a> says the following: <q cite="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.12">The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body in the request message.</q></p>

<p>It appears that a server is returning code 411 when a client (=browser) tries to send data to the server without specifying the size of the data. Normally a client only receives data from the server (reading pages), and all common modern browsers are programmed in such a way that they include the data length when sending data.</p>

<p>Therefore I suspected that somebody with a home-grown application had tried to mess with my site.
I did a quick grep in my Apache log files and found out that somebody had accessed the file mt-xmlrpc.cgi with an application that identified itself as <code>Java/1.4.1_01</code>.</p>

<p>This file is a XML-RPC interface to Movable Type, allowing other applications to interact with MT, for example to publish entries on this site from a special desktop client.</p>

<p>Since I am the only responsible for this site, nobody but me has any reason to use this file. This visitor also triggered my Spam trap, and was already blocked from my system, but if not, his badly programmed application did ring the alarm bell.</p>

         	<p>I just found a small list on my desk, and remembered that I wrote it last Friday (or better said! Saturday morning) to publish it later on this site.</p>

<p>The aim was to make it clear that I had a great night, visiting my favourite club <a href="http://www.pentagramasoulclub.com/">Pentagrama</a> again.</p>

<p>These are the titles and artists of some songs they played, and people who know me and these songs can imaging that I was enjoying a lot.</p>

<ul>
    <li>London calling — Clash</li>
    <li>Personal Jesus — Depeche Mode</li>
    <li>Black Betty — Ram Jam</li>
    <li>Tunnel of love — Dire Straits</li>
    <li>Should I stay or should I go — Clash</li>
    <li>Entre dos tierras — Héroes del Silencio</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[Update 2003.08.28]</strong>: Coen van Kuijk sent me a list which contained only one mistake. After a small hint he was able to give me all the names of the artists.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2003.09.03]</strong>: Since I haven&rsquo;t received any other messages, I decided to fill in the artists and close the competition.</p>

         	<p>When I designed this site, I of course tested the layout on my Windows computer. I know that it looks alright with IE6 and Mozilla, and I suspect that it looks acceptable in most other OS/browser combinations.</p>

<p>If I would be a professional designer, I would run it through the famous <a href="http://www.browsercam.com/">BrowserCam</a>, but my little site is not worth the money.</p>

<p>Of course there are some emulators available, which might give you an idea of how your site looks, but remember that if something looks wrong you never know for sure whether it is your code or the emulator.</p>

<p>A new emulator I found today, shows <a title="iPaq Browser" href="http://relay5.yospace.com/ipaqbrowser/ipaqbrowser.html?http://braintags.com/">how this site looks on an iPaq PDA</a>.</p>

<p>Mmmm. Header to big, no <em>skip navigation</em> link, useless side column, font too big, … But still readable. I also loaded the Fimcap site, which still has a tables based layout, and that looked way worse. To read the text you have to keep on scrolling.</p>

<p>I guess I will have to make a new stylesheet, or maybe serve PDA&rsquo;s the print stylesheet. But the print stylesheet removes all the navigational elements…</p>

<p>Anyway, the coming days I will tweak this site so it will look better for my mobile readers — do I have any?</p>

         	<p>First a question for the music industry: “What the heck are you doing?”</p>

<p>Yesterday MJ gave me a present; the CD Fleshwounds from Skin.</p>

<p>Of course I was really happy with it, but I immediately noticed a big label on both sides with the words COPY CONTROLLED. In the specifications I read that this CD would work in any CD-player, the latest Macs and PCs with minimal Pentium II, 233 MHz and 64MB RAM. I am perfectly happy with my Cyrix P133+ with 48MB RAM, and until now I was able to play any CD I liked.</p>

<p>Of course I tried to play the CD, but my computer could not find the CD. 🙁</p>

<p>I really like buying CD&rsquo;s; I prefer to buy one to using a copied CD. Because for me the CD is more than just the disk with the bits and bytes. I like to look at the artwork in the booklet, and no inkjet printed paper gives me the same feeling as the original CD.</p>

<p>And because I usually buy older CD&rsquo;s, I never feel that I pay a lot; of course I wouldn&rsquo;t complain if they became cheaper.</p>

<p>So I buy the original CD&rsquo;s because of the better quality of the total product.</p>

<p>But now the record companies are throwing in their own windows, because they decrease the quality of their product. And why would I want to pay a lot for something that is broken?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any problem yet, since there are so many old CD&rsquo;s out there that I still want to buy. But I can assure that I am never ever going to buy a copy protected CD anymore. Not because I want to copy it, which I feel is my right, but because it is essentially a broken product.</p>

<p>You can read more about copy-protected CD&rsquo;s at <a title="Copy-controlled CDs: Is the end in sight?" href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/7/10/181528/569">Kuro5hin</a> or if you truely want to know everything you can go to <a href="http://ukcdr.org/issues/cd/">the UK campain for Digital Rights</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Most viruses that replicate themselves through e-mail forge the <em>from:</em> field of their messages. Usually they take a random address, or pick one from your address book or web cache. Therefore, a virus appearing to come from jeroen@example.com, rarely really originates from this address.</p>

<p>I can image that some users don&rsquo;t know this, and when they receive a virus from me they send me a reply with a warning that I have a virus.</p>

<p>Usually I explain these people the story above and tell them, of course after checking that my anti-virus software is up-to-date, that I don&rsquo;t have a virus. No problem for me.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is that some people who are responsible for really big mail servers also don&rsquo;t understand that viruses forge headers, and have their servers configured in such a way that they reply to me.</p>

<p>Of course they have the right to block a message with a virus to protect their customers. But please don&rsquo;t bother me with these messages. I can assure you that I am not the one sending these messages; just check the mail headers and you will see that they originate from a completely different server.</p>

<p>This morning somebody who apparently had visited my site cached a virus and started sending out the virus in my name. Luckily for him, his provider scans all incoming SMTP mail and intercepted all messages.</p>

<p>Instead of simply not accepting these messages, they had configured procmail to send a warning to the address mentioned in the from-field (me) including the virus!!!!!</p>

<p>As a result, my inbox is flooded with viruses from this server (mail.infosys.tuwien.ac.at).</p>

<p>Once again, none of my computers is infected with a virus.</p>

         	<p>I have written before about the <a href="/2003/07/movable_type_plugins/">Movable Type plug-ins I use for this site</a>; at this moment I am using seven different plug-ins.</p>

<p>The more plug-ins you use, the more difficult it becomes to maintain the site. Because once in a while new versions appear, and I don&rsquo;t want to scan seven (eight if you include MT itself) sites to see if updates are available.</p>

<p>But now there is the <a title="MT Plug-in Directory: Plug-ins Manager" href="http://manager.mt-plugins.org/">MT Plug-ins Manager</a>. I downloaded the files, placed them on the server and fired up the page. A neat list with all available plug-ins appeared.</p>

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t install my plug-ins with this tool, the plug-in manager did not know yet which plug-ins I already have installed. So I went to the Manual Registration section, where I could specify the version number and plug-in name of each file in my plugins directory.</p>

<p>After entering these details I went back to my main page, and noticed an <em>update</em> button next to the IfEmpty plug-in. I was using version 1.1, while the latest version is 1.11. I clicked the button, waited some seconds and my plug-in was updated.</p>

<p>This is great!!! No more downloading from different sites, unzipping, FTP-ing,… One click on the button does the job.</p>

<p>Tomorrow evening my parents will be flying back home.</p>
<p>They have been living with us for one week now, and it has been really wonderful. At this moment they are enjoying the weather in the swimming pool, just like most other afternoons.</p>
<p>Before going home, they will say goodbye to my in-laws.</p>
<p>They can get along very well, despite of the huge communication problems they have.</p>
<p>Tonight we will surely play some cards (for the last time) and have a small dinner. Tomorrow they will pack their backs, go one more time to the swimming pool, and catch the airplane.</p>
<p>We will surely miss them; our house will be more empty without them. But the good news is that we will see them again when we will visit the Netherlands next month.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday evening my parents arrived for a short holiday in our house. I came home from work a little bit late, so I had to run a little bit to be ready before they arrived. I cleaned the last things, ironed our clothes and prepared a spinach/salmon quiche and a salad with cheese and apple.</p>

<p>When MJ arrived with them, I showed them around in our house. My mother only had seen it before we started the reconstruction, and though my father had visited us in January, enough things have changed in the mean time.</p>

<p>At half past ten we started our supper, which was even for us a little bit late. Fortunately my parents had eaten some <em>krentenbollen</em> (anybody knows the translation?) in the airplane. After supper we talked a little bit and we showed them our holiday photo&rsquo;s from Croatia.</p>

<p>This morning before going to work, I prepared the table for breakfast. While they were eating, I gave them our map of Lleida and explained them where our house is and where they can find interesting things. I also explained them how to make coffee and gave them the keys of the house. I am sure that they will be alright.</p>

         	<p>Some of you receive a message whenever I update this site. You can become a member of my update list by filling in your details on the form on my first page. I am using an external service (<a href="http://www.bloglet.com/">Bloglet</a>) to handle these messages.</p>

<p>But now that I have my new provider, I am taking things in my own hands again. I have created a MailMan mailing list to which I will add all people receiving messages . At this moment I am still testing—in fact, this post is a test to see whether the notifications arrive to the list—and as soon as everything works, I will change the form on my site, so new subscription will automatically be added to the list.</p>

<p>Movable Type supports a notification list, but has no mechanism to manage this list. I will have to add, remove and change all addresses by hand, and since I am lazy I looked for a way to automate this. So now the only e-mail address in the MT notification list is the mailing list address. After that, MailMan will take care about distributing the message to all interested persons.</p>

<p>MailMan also provides a management interface where the recipients of my messages can configure their accounts.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 12.08.2003]</strong> The test performed by this message worked flawlessly, so I deleted the Bloglet service and replaced the subscription form by a MailMan form. In the mean time I was able to help some other people setting up MailMan for their subscriptions by pointing them to the FAQ <a href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw-mm.py?query=newsletter%2Fannouncement%2Fone-way&amp;querytype=simple&amp;casefold=yes&amp;req=search">How do I create a newsletter/announcement/one-way list?</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It has been three days ago since I switched my site to the new server. Little by little the visitors switched as DNS servers synchronised all over the world. And little by little I noticed some problems on my site.</p>

<p>These problems were related the two changes I made in the set-up of my site: I moved my photo gallery from its subdirectory <code>/photos</code> to its own sub-domain <code>photos.braintags.com</code> and I changed all URLs of the individual archives from <code>entry_name.html</code> to <code>entry_name/index.shtml</code>.</p>

<p>The first change broke all links to the photos (and what is a photo gallery without photos?) which I corrected by editing all 51 entries. Furthermore I still have to create a symbolic link to some files from my main site, like <code>robots.txt</code>.</p>

<p>The second change broke nothing on my site, but some links to my pages on other sites (Google!) broke terribly. Therefore I decided to us my good friend <a title="Apache module mod_rewrite" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> to serve people the right page. All I had to do was to create a rule to redirect requests for <code>/archives/yyyy/mm/entry_name.html</code> to <code>/archives/yyyy/mm/entry_name/</code>. So I created the following rule:</p>

<p><code># Redirect old URI&rsquo;s to future-proof directories
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule (archives/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/.*)&#046;html$ $1/ [R=permanent]</code></p>

<p>This did a good job, except for two problems: it also redirected the URI of my monthly archives to <code>archives/yyyy/mm/index/</code> and it added a slash in front of the URI, so the URL would look like <code><a href="http://jeroensangers.com//archives/">http://jeroensangers.com//archives/</a></code>… The first problem was easily solved:</p>

<p><code># Redirect old URI&rsquo;s to future-proof directories
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !index.s?html$
RewriteRule (archives/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/.*)&#046;html$ $1/ [R=permanent]</code></p>

<p>For the second problem I am still looking for a solution.</p>

         	<p>Change of plans…</p>

<p>Yesterday I told that I was going to redesign my templates and style before switching to the new hosting provider. After one day of design work, I realise that I want so many changes that the rewrite is going to take weeks.</p>

<p>The style I was using until now was based on the default templates of Movable Type, which I adapted by adding and deleting some things, until it looked <em>almost</em> like what I wanted. What I am doing now, is starting with an empty file and adding one by one the elements I want to see. This is a slowly process, since I cannot spend the whole day working on this—I wish I could!</p>

<p>So now I decided that I am going to copy everything as it is now to the new location, and continue the rewrite on the background. Therefore I disabled comments on the most popular entries (to disable comments on all entries I need to edit them one-by-one. There is a script that can do this, but is requires PHP and MySQL, two of the reasons I am switching to another provider).</p>

<p>Now I have to copy the templates and do an export and import of the data. If everything works well, you will read the next message from the new server.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After I purchased an account for this site last weekend, I have been exploring the possibilities and planning how to switch my site to the new server. I prefer to think a little bit before I start copying recklessly.</p>

<p>The thing that took most of my time is making choices, since I have now so many more options than I had before. For example, I have three options to access my e-mail with a web client (NeoMail, horde or SquirrelMail), and three options to analyse the access statistics (AWStats, webalizer, Urchin).</p>

<p>Besides making choices, I have been experimenting on setting up a mailing list for the notifications, created a subdomain for my photo gallery, blocked some IP addresses, activated SpamAssasin on my e-mail, …</p>

<p>All these options are comfortably available through <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/">cPanel</a>, something I have never seen before, but which I liked immediately.</p>

<p>Of course I started installing Movable Type, this time using a MySQL database to store all the information.</p>

<p>This gave me also the opportunity to play a little bit with MySQL. After setting up MT, I configured my three weblogs (Braintags, Braintags Gallery and Braintags Static Content), but did not yet copy the style sheets. I want to use this site conversion to update all my templates and styles. I am thinking about using a three-column layout for my main page, since the current sidebar is too long.</p>

<p>Besides that, I want to integrate my photo gallery by using a likewise style. So the next week I will be playing HTML-Kit and TopStyle Pro.</p>

<p>Once this is done, I will export and import all the date and change the DNS record so you all can see the new site (without pop-up banners!!).</p>

         	<p>FOAF provides an execellent vocabulary for describing people and the relation between people. It is a way to describe yourself—your name, email address, and the people you&rsquo;re friends with—using XML and RDF.</p>

<p>This allows software to process these descriptions, perhaps as part of an automated search engine, to discover information about your and the communities of which you&rsquo;re a member.</p>

<p>Of course I created a FOAF description of myself, using the <a title="FOAF-a-matic -- Describe yourself in RDF" href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html">FOAF-a-Matic</a>. You can find my FOAF at <a href="/foaf.rdf">http://braintags.com/foaf.rdf</a>. If you link your FOAF to mine, please let me know, so I can update my file.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 03.08.2003]</strong>: After seeing 23 404-errors in my logfile, I came to the conclusion that I must have saved the FOAF file with the wrong name. It is now fixed, so it should work alright.</p>

<p>For those people who are too lazy to look into the file, my FOAF description looks as follows:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I don&rsquo;t notice the pop-up advertisements on this site anymore, since the browsers I am normally using (Mozilla &amp; Firebird) block them, but I know that they irritate quite some visitors of this site.</p>

<p>But as they say: you get what you pay for. I pay nothing for hosting this site, and in return I&rsquo;ll have to accept that <a href="http://www.hypermart.net/">my provider</a> adds these horrible things to my pages. 🙁</p>

<p>But I have good news for you: today I arranged a new hosting provider, and since I am paying a little bit, they will host my site banner free!!!!!!. I could have upgraded my current account, but I have found a provider who gives me a lot more for less!!!</p>

<p>Here are the specs:</p>

<ul>
    <li>75mb disk space</li>
    <li>5gb/month bandwidth</li>
    <li>Unlimited e-mail accounts</li>
    <li>Unlimited FTP accounts</li>
    <li>Unlimited MySQL 4 databases</li>
    <li>Unlimited subdomains</li>
    <li>4 mailing lists</li>
    <li>One domain</li>
    <li>PHP 4.3.1</li>
    <li>CGI-Bin (Perl)</li>
    <li>POP3, SMTP, IMAP, &amp; Webmail</li>
    <li>Unlimited e-mail forwarders</li>
    <li>Unlimited autoresponders</li>
    <li>crontab</li>
    <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, the biggest advancements are the MySQL database, unlimited POP3 boxes and PHP. I don&rsquo;t know anything about PHP, but I have seen a lot of handy code that I would like to copy &amp; paste in my templates.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that without the banner code, my pages will contain valid XHTML 1.1 code.</p>

<p>For the coming period, I&rsquo;m afraid that I will still serve my site from the old location with pop-ups, since I want to set up the new server really, really good, and like to fix some design flaws in the current site.</p>

<p>Be patient, dear visitors…</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Már Örlygsson has written a <a title="Howto: Future-proof URLs in Movable Type | Már Örlygsson (June 22. 2003)" href="http://mar.anomy.net/entry/2003/06/22/17.15.00/">howto</a> on creating ‘future-proof’ URLs in Movable type.</p>

<p>In short, he suggests storing individual archives at <code><a href="http://www.example.com/archive/2003/06/17/12.35.57/">http://www.example.com/archive/2003/06/17/12.35.57/</a></code>. The archive file will be called index.html.</p>

<p>I like this idea, since it will allow me to change my site, without having to change my URLs. If for example one day I decide to use PHP in my pages, all I have to do is change the template and create index.php files. Since the URL&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t change, no links break.</p>

<p>Some day I might try to implement this, but I won&rsquo;t use the directory structure Már proposes (<code>/yyyy/mm/dd/hh.mm/</code>). He doesn&rsquo;t use the title in the URL, since he writes in Icelandic, which has some ‘strange’ characters. I write in English, so I don&rsquo;t have that problem.</p>

<p>The other problem Már describes is that the location of the file changes if you change the title. This is true, but I also think that you think first before you post, and choose the best title possible. I have never changed a title of a post afterwards, and am not planning to do so in the future. I do see that this might be a small risk.</p>

<p>I also won&rsquo;t use a directory-level for the day. Not only because I don&rsquo;t post that much, but even if in the future I start posting three entries each day, the 90 files per directory won&rsquo;t be a big problem. The benefit of keeping the URL short and clear is more important for me.</p>

<p>When I want to reread a message, I often just type in the URL. I can&rsquo;t always remember the exact day, but usually I know the month and the title of the post. With these two bits of information, I can quickly look up a page. So I’ll opt for URI&rsquo;s like <code>/archives/yyyy/mm/title_of_the_post/</code>.</p>

         	<p>Today I finished entering my photo&rsquo;s (51 in total) to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainpics/">photo log</a>. You won&rsquo;t find any new photo&rsquo;s there; all these photo&rsquo;s have been available on my site for a long time already.</p>

<p>The benefits of this whole operation are that my photo&rsquo;s can now have more than one category, the navigation is more intuitive and that you now have the ability to leave comments on photo&rsquo;s (I implemented the photo log in MT). Besides that, it will be easier to maintain the whole thing, since I control my whole site with a single tool.</p>

<p>Now that this is ready, I have only two things left to do: remove the old Image Gallery and forward request for its pages to the new location, and restyle the photo log according to the style of the rest of the site. The first thing I will do today, the second one may take several months.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 31.07.2003]</strong>: I just removed Image Gallery and changed my .htaccess file to redirect all requests to my photo log.</p>

         	<p>After seeing a poll on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">SlashDot</a> for <a href="http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=984">the number of operating systems you have worked with for at least an hour</a>, I started thinking about my answer to that question.</p>

<p>My first guess would be something like 6-8. After thinking a little bit more, I came to the following list:</p>

<ul>
    <li>AIX</li>
    <li>Apollo Domain</li>
    <li>BeOS</li>
    <li>Commodore 64 OS</li>
    <li>DR-DOS</li>
    <li>FreeBSD</li>
    <li>HP-UX</li>
    <li>Irix</li>
    <li>iOS</li>
    <li>Linux (HAL91, Mandrake, muLinux, RedHat, Slackware, SUSe)</li>
    <li>Mac System 5/6/7</li>
    <li>MS-DOS</li>
    <li>Netware</li>
    <li>OS/2</li>
    <li>PalmOS</li>
    <li>SCO Unix</li>
    <li>Solaris</li>
    <li>Thu64</li>
    <li>VMS</li>
    <li>Windows 3.x</li>
    <li>Windows 9x/Me</li>
    <li>Windows NT/2000/XP</li>
    <li>Windows CE/PocketPC</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes 23, amazing!!!</p>

<p>Of course you can always discuss about the definition of an OS. I decided to group some closely relates OS&rsquo;s like Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me, and the different Linux distributions, but other people might consider each of them as a seperate OS. I have been thinking to group all flavours of Unix (including Linux) in one group, but than I would also have to group all flavours of Windows. Fact is that the different Unices can be very different from each other, so I left them alone.</p>

<p>What is your list? Have you worked with any OS that is not on my list? Just leave your list in a comment.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I mentioned them yesterday: the not yet so famous band <a href="http://www.apesjit.nl/">Apesjit</a>.</p>

<p>Why Apesjit? Sure, they are not the greatest band I know, but they are nice guys, certainly funny and play quite well. In short, they deserve some promotion and I gladly reserve a small spot on my site for them.</p>

<p>The first time I met Apesjit was in 1999 when we went to the <a href="http://www.nirwana.nl">Nirwana</a> tuinfeest, a small festival in Lierop. We didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, but after seeing Apesjit on Saturday early in the afternoon, we knew that we would have a great weekend. What a show!!!</p>

<p>Of course we immediately bought some t-shirts and after that directly to the band to complain about the text on the shirt. This was the case: they tried to convince us that you have to pronounce the band name as in English: Ape-shit. However, the spelling of their name is definitely Dutch (and their lyrics are Dutch as well), so we continued pronouncing the name in Dutch. Part of the t-shirt contained a dictionary page, explaining what Apesjit is, and according to the band we could see there how to pronounce it: Eip&ndash;∫jit. We told the band to make up their minds and choose between their Apeshit or Eipfjit. Until that moment we will continue using the Dutch pronunciation.</p>

<p>After that first concert we have travelled several times to the far south of the Netherlands to see them (on stage or looking side by side to other bands), and we even arranged a concert for them in Harmelen.</p>

<p>Now that I live in Lleida, I cannot visit them anymore. I surely would have liked to see their performance at the <a href="http://www.zwartecross.nl">zwarte cross</a>, where they played from a truck driving over the cross track. And surely they will be present at the coming Tuinfeest festival; not to play, but to enjoy the music and drink some beer.</p>

<p>If I want to see them again, I will just have to wait until they are famous enough to do an European tour. Until that moment; all I can do is give them some publicity…</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Over the years, the emphasis of my site has changed a lot.</p>

<p>I started a personal site mainly to experiment with this new phenomenon. First I created a list with hyperlinks, mainly to sites about the Internet and sites about music.</p>

<p>After that I added some info about myself and started writing a sort of diary.</p>

<p>Later I was able to export data from my CD database, so everybody could see which CD&rsquo;s I own. Besides experimenting with databases, I did this because I think that someone&rsquo;s music preferences tells a lot about the person, and makes it easier to identify the writer.</p>

<p>Just before moving to Lleida, I created a completely new site with stories and photo&rsquo;s from my life over here. Now, 20 months later, I am looking at my site, and feel that something is missing. This site does not swing, it does not rock and it does not dance. This site misses music!!!!</p>

<p>The only fragment of music on this site is the link to <a href="http://www.apesjit.nl/">ApeSjit</a> on my blogroll.</p>

<p>Listening to music is one of my greatest hobbies; the moment I come home I turn on the radio or put a CD. Since this site is about me, it needs music. Therefore I created a new category, so I will be stimulated to write about music.</p>

<p>In the future I will try to add my CD database again, but I want it to be completely automated, since the old solution needed a lot of manual copy and paste work. And maybe I will add the ‘<em>Currently listening to</em>’ feature so many other sites show.</p>

<p>This site is going to rock!!! :-D</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: this site is not receiving a lot of visitors.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have the feeling that I am the only one reading my texts. And I know exactly why. The main reason is that this site is not so interesting. And that is because I am not a great writer.</p>

<p>That sounds really pessimistic, but in my opinion it is realistic. My style of writing has been created at school; due to my education I mainly write down the ‘cold facts’, and try to use as less words as possible, while the sites I like to read are funny, well-written, poetic, …</p>

<p>The other problem this site suffers from is the subjects. I mainly write about two subjects: my life in Lleida, which is only interesting to the people who know me, and some technological news, which van also be found on a thousand other sites.</p>

<p>But I am like this, and this is my site. Even though not a lot of people are reading my writings, I really appreciate the people who <strong>do</strong> take the time to read it.</p>

<p>Because they are interested in my life now that I am living far away. Or because they are interested in some technological information I have been writing about (I hope that you could use the information I gave you). Or because they accidentally came here looking for something that is nor here (most people arriving on my site through a search engine are looking for Spanish curse words or serial numbers). No matter why they are visiting this site, I appreciate it.</p>

<p>But still, deep in my heart I keep hoping that one day this site will have a group of enthusiastic regular readers posting comments on the things I write.</p>

<p>To make this dream come true, I only have to do one thing: write better, more interesting texts. I&rsquo;ve got work to do!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> is a great tool for creating personal sites (and some other types of sites as well), mainly due to its flexible template system and its many features like trackback, image upload &amp; write functionality, sanitising,…</p>

<p>Regular readers (are there any?) of this site know that I did not need a lot of time to set up this site. However, I still keep on tweaking parts of the site to make it even better. It started with converting the templates from XHTML 1.0 to XHTML 1.1. After that I moved a little bit around with the different items shown on the pages, and adjusted the style sheet.</p>

<p>And soon I ran into the limits of Movable Type. Some things are simple not possible, are they? Fortunately, I am never the only one facing the limitations, and usually one of the guru&rsquo;s out there solved the problem for me, always with a plugin.</p>

<p>Plugins are <strong>the</strong> feature making MT such a great tool. If MT cannot do it, there is always a plugin that can do it for you!!!</p>

<p>The following list describes the plugins I am using at the moment, and why I am using them:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.milbertus.com/archives/2003/04/002002.php">BlogCopyright</a>
I could have created the functionality of this plugin by using a template module, but this is simply easier. BlogCopyright automatically creates the copyright message at the bottom of each page. It uses the year of the first and the last post and the author of the first message on the page. This means that I don&rsquo;t have to change anything when we enter the year 2004.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mtifempty.php">ifEmpty</a>
This is more a programmers tool. It allows me to hide certain elements when they are empty. I use it in the definition of the file location of my Static Contents section. There, the category gives me the directory in which the file is placed. If there is no category, the file has to be placed in the root of the site.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mtmacros.php">macros</a>
Another tool to automate things. I use this plugin to create automatically the right code for some common abbreviations and acronyms. For example, <code>MT</code> becomes <code>&lt;abbr title=&ldquo;Movable Type&rdquo;&gt;MT&lt;/abbr&gt;</code>. By the way, the macros are automatically created from a short list using the MTPerlScript plugin (idea shamelessly <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15/better_living_through_regular_expressions.html">stolen from Mark Pilgrim</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rayners.org/archives/000108.php">otherblog</a>
Normally the sections are completely separated; you cannot access data like the name or the contents from an entry from outside a section. I am using a special section to manage my static contents, but would like to use some elements like the banner from my main section in the templates of the static contents. This plugin allows me to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mtperlscript.php">perlscript</a>
Again a very low-level plugin. This plugin allows me to execute Perl scripts from my templates. I use it to create my yearly archive pages, since MT only offers monthly archives. I am writing since 1997, so the list of monthly archives is way too long, therefore I created the yearly archive pages.</p>

<p><a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/02/simplecomments/">simplecomments</a>
There are two ways to react to my writings: you can leave a comment, or you can write about it on your own site and notify me using TrackBack. By default, MT keeps them separated, providing a list of comments and a list of trackbacks. In my point of view, comments and trackbacks are basically the same, but in different places. Therefore, I prefer to have a single comments list, with both the comments residing on my site as the comments written on other sites. SimpleComments does this for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">smartypants</a>
Smartypants fixes the typographic punctuation of my entries. It converts straight quotes ( &ldquo; and &lsquo; ) into “curly” quote HTML entities, dashes (“<code>&ndash;</code>” and “<code>&ndash;</code>”) into en- and em-dash entities and three consecutive dots (“<code>&hellip;</code>”) into an ellipsis entity. Just to make it more perfect…</p>

         	<p>I just noticed that I have only written technical texts during the lasts weeks, and since this is a personal page, hereby a short update on my life:</p>

<p>Things are going regular. I am very busy at work, and go home to relax. Despite of the heat in the city, we manage to keep our house cool by blocking any ray of sun during the day (our 30 cm thick walls also help a lot…). In our free time, we mainly relax: in the sofa, on a terrace, in the cinema or in the swimming pool.</p>

<p>Not really special, and that certainly is the reason you haven&rsquo;t read much about it.</p>

         	<p>A month ago, I wrote about the <a title="Braintags: Internet Explorer" href="/2003/06/internet_explorer/">shortcomings of Internet Explorer</a> and how this might stop innovation on the Internet in the coming years.</p>

<p>All over the web, people have expressed their worries, and a lot of web designers are afraid to have to deal with an obsolete browser for many many years. And of course, an action has been started to convince users to switch to another browser: <a title="Use a Better Browser" href="http://giantfightingrobots.com/betterbrowser.html">Use a Better Browser</a>. They ask site owners to place a button on their site, linked to a page explaining why other browsers are better than IE.</p>

<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2762 aligncenter" src="https://JeroenSangers.micro.blog/uploads/2020/dd1c8aa6fc.jpg" alt="Use a better browser" width="90" height="19" /></p>

<p>Although I agree with them that IE is quickly becoming a dinosaur, I don&rsquo;t think that a button will let many users change their browser. However, they <em>will</em> change because of (lack of) features. If other browsers have features IE does not have, users might switch.</p>

<p>Therefore, the best way to convince IE-users to show them the tabbed browser interface and pop-up blocking of Mozilla and create sites using code that is not supported by IE.</p>

<p>Of course, degrade gracefully. Something as the <code>position:fixed</code> CSS property can serve for this purpose, for example for creating a floating navigation bar which will always be visible on the top of the screen. IE users will simply have to scroll up to navigate (as always), while visitors with newer browsers will have the benefits of having the navigation always at hand.</p>

<p>Other features that can be used to create better sites, are described in Eric Meyer&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/">css/edge</a>. These won&rsquo;t work on IE, but won&rsquo;t make the page unusable.</p>

<p>So go ahead, design your pages using the latest coding possibilities, but degrade gracefully!!</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/07/22/http-error-permanent.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-07-22 09:58:44 &#43;0100">Jul 22, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A while ago, I explained how I configured the server to return <a title="Braintags: HTTP Error 410: Gone" href="/2003/06/http_error_410_gone/">HTTP Error 410: Gone</a> for all requests for pages created with my old CMS.</p>

<p>After installing Movable Type, all pages of my site moved to another location, and I was not able to work out the new location of the files. In short, error 410 says: <q cite="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.11">The requested file used to exist on this location, but it has gone to an unknown location</q>. This message is more clear than the message returned by default; the famous 404.</p>

<p>I always check the server logs for 404 messages, since it might indicate that a link on the site is wrong and I&rsquo;ll have to fix that. One of the files coming up regulary in that log is the default MT stylesheet styles-site.css, which I have replaced by my own stylesheet with a different name.</p>

<p>I immediately wanted to add this file to my ‘410–list’, but then I realised that 410 is not the correct code, since I <em>do</em> know where the file went.</p>

<p>Therefore a better solution would be to return code 301 (permanent redirect) together with the new location, so any smart client would simply redirect to the new address.</p>

<p>To implement this, I only needed to add a single line to the <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<p><code>Redirect permanent /styles-site.css <a href="http://www.braintags.com/paz.css">http://www.braintags.com/paz.css</a></code></p>

<p>This line tells the server to redirect requests for <code>/styles-site.css</code> with code ‘permanent’ to the file <code><a href="http://www.braintags.com/paz.css">http://www.braintags.com/paz.css</a></code>. Remember that the destination always has to be a complete URL!!</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/07/18/more-on-managing.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-07-18 16:47:29 &#43;0100">Jul 18, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After yesterdays post I started playing more with Movable Type.</p>

<p>I decided to move some static content from my site to a separate section, as described by <a title="Brad Choate: Doing your whole site with MT" href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001656.php">Brad Choate</a>. At that moment, the only static content I had were the HTML error pages, displayed in case somebody asks a non-existing page. These pages were implemented as index templates, but with the new method I can treat them as normal texts without having to edit HTML code. I also decided to move the Stylesheet templates to the new section, since they are hardly ever updated.</p>

<p>After entering the texts for the error documents, I ran into a problem. I wanted to use almost the same templates as I am using for the rest of the site, but these templates make use of template modules (text snippets), which are linked to a specific section. So I started looking for a solution to display information from one section into another. And I found exactly what I was looking for: <a title="David Raynes: MTOtherBlog (v 0.25)" href="http://www.rayners.org/archives/000108.php">MTOtherBlog</a>.</p>

<p>After this success I created some more static content (a Spambot trap), and fixed my <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi">search page</a> with the MTOtherBlog plugin.</p>

<p>I am very happy with my MT static content solution. However, after this experience I realise that MT is not suited for the <a title="International Federation of Catholic Parochial Youth Movements" href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap site</a>, since it has too much static content in a more complex directory structure. This would mean that we have to create a seperate category for every subcategory, which would make it difficult to manage.</p>

         	<p>The buzz started with the redesign of <a title="adaptive path » the value of experience" href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a> by <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">[stop]design</a> and <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/">Jay Allen</a>. They used the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> blogger software to produce a commercial site. And not only as a CMS to publish their ‘Appearances’, ‘Essays’ and ‘News’, but also to manage the static content of the site! Jay Allen posted a description of <a title="stopdesign | log archive | Adaptive Path's MT Setup" href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/07/11/adaptive_paths_mt_setup.html">how he set up the Adaptive Path configuration</a>.</p>

<p>Other people already had the same idea or started working after reading the above story. Doug Bowman of [stop]design started <a title="stopdesign | log archive | Rebuilding a Portfolio" href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/07/16/rebuilding_a_portfolio.html">managing his portfolio</a> with MT, Matt Haughey explains <a title="A Whole Lotta Features" href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/features.blah/entry/007162">how to use MT in alternative ways</a>, like creating an About page and using the database fields in different ways. He also lists some sites using MT this way.</p>

<p>And finally, master MT-hacker Brad Choate explains <a title="Brad Choate: Doing your whole site with MT" href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001656.php">how to use the MT-categories to place static content in directories</a>. Managing static content with MT is definitely THE hype of this week!!!</p>

<p>I have been reading all this with a lot of interest. Already for a while Sebastiaan and I are thinking about a CMS for our <a title="International Federation of Catholic Parochial Youth Movements" href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a> site, since this site is at this moment completely maintained by hand at HTML level.</p>

<p>We do use some Server Side Includes (SSI) to handle general content like the page headers and footers, and NewsPro for some content, but mostly we have to change the HTML code. This makes it also really difficult for others to contribute to the site, since they first have to understand HTML and the organisation of our site.</p>

<p>We have been looking around a while ago, and the best fit I could find at that moment was <a href="http://www.plone.org/">Plone</a>, but since Plone is so completely different from what we are doing now, this would involve a really steep learning curve.</p>

<p>But now it looks like we can do it in MT. We can manage our static content, create templates, and store our dynamical content. The only thing I have to figure out is how we can implement the site in three languages. I guess I will just set up a demo and start playing…</p>

         	<p>Yesterday I have installed <a title="Thunderbird Mail Project Page" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> on my computer.</p>

<p>Until now I was using Microsoft Outlook Express to handle my mail, but I was far from satisfied with it. I never have been a great fan of OE, but since my computer is very old (1997) with limited resources (Cyrix P150+, 48Mb RAM), I am very careful not installing too much heavy software on it. Therefore I stick with the default Windows applications as much as possible, unless they are completely unworkable.</p>

<p>A while ago I already switched from IE6 (which was almost as old as my computer) to <a title="Firebird Browser Project Page" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/">Mozilla Firebird</a> for <a title="A Whole Lotta Features" href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/features.blah/entry/006650">obvious reasons</a>, and I never looked back to Internet Explorer anymore.</p>

<p>Outlook Express was also close to unworkable for me. Its limited filtering, habit of creating bloated e-mail and top posting were bugging me all the time.</p>

<p>Time for a change, and my Mozilla experience lead me to Thunderbird. The only problem is that the Thunderbird project is still in a alpha stage, and therefore surely still contains some bugs. I decided to install it anyway, and until now I haven&rsquo;t found a single bug!</p>

<p>It feels a little bit slower than OE, but it certainly makes life a lot easier. I was able to import my Outlook Express address book and mail without problems, and was able to set up a (Bayesian) Spam filter in no time.</p>

<p>I still have to do some additional configuring like specifying the signatures and adding my certificates, but my experience so-far is more than positive!!!</p>

         	<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2751 alignright" src="https://JeroenSangers.micro.blog/uploads/2020/4319791e50.jpg" alt="spam" width="200" height="173" />I am receiving a lot of Spam, way too much…</p>

<p>The last years the amount of Spam I receive has been steadily growing, and now I receive about 50 messages per day. But I am not going to sit down and accept it; no, I am fighting Spam. I am fighting Spam because Spam takes away the pleasure and the functionality of a system I like and use a lot. Spam is about to destroy e-mail. I fight Spam in several ways, here is how…</p>

<h2>I am very careful with my e-mail address</h2>

<p>The most important thing is to make sure that spammers don&rsquo;t get your e-mail address.</p>

<p>I always try to avoid to fill in an e-mail address in guest books, forums and when requesting online information. If I do have to give my e-mail address, I always make sure I can track down the source.</p>

<p>I can do that, since I have my own domain. If I have to leave my address at example.com, I will use example.com@jeroensangers.com. The moment I start receiving Spam on this address, I can easily block it.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have your own domain, this is not possible, but make always sure that you only put your address on-line if you really have to. <a title="Address Munging Considered Harmful" href="http://www.interhack.net/pubs/munging-harmful/">And never munge your address by adding something like NOSPAM!!!!!</a></p>

<h2>I never let spammers white list my e-mail address</h2>

<p>Spammers look for addresses on the Internet, but a lot of them are not used anymore. Therefore they try to verify that somebody is reading the mail; a verified address is worth more to the spammer.</p>

<p>There are two common ways to whitelist an e-mail address. The most common is the ‘Remove me from this list’ message at the bottom of much Spam.</p>

<p>But instead of removing you from their Spam list, the spammer will put you on the verified addresses list, and you will surely receive more Spam. Therefore I never use these links to remove me from a Spam list.</p>

<p>The second method of white listing uses images. The spammer links to an image with a code in the filename, and when you open the message this image is loaded from the spammer&rsquo;s server. After that the spammer can check the code in the image name and your e-mail address is verified!</p>

<p>I usually use Mozilla mail, which let you select whether you want to view messages in HTML (including images) or as plain text. Although a lot of people send messages in HTML by default, few messages have content that NEED this, so I usually read my messages in plain text. (I also send my messages in plain text, but <a title="Braintags: Fancy e-mail" href="/2003/06/fancy_email/">that is a different story</a>). People using Outlook will have to disable their preview pane to prevent images from being loaded automatically.</p>

<h2>I separate Spam from my normal mail</h2>

<p>No matter how hard you try to prevent Spam, at a certain moment you will receive some, and it will never stop. In 99% of the cases you can easily recognise Spam from the sender and the subject, which are unknown, strange, in a foreign language and coded (texts like: jbkdk,bjhskda).</p>

<p>I always make sure to directly put Spam messages in a separate folder, so I can continue reading my regular mail, and deal with the Spam later. If you don&rsquo;t receive many messages, you can do this by hand, but lazy people like me like this to be automated.</p>

<p>The latest technology is based on <a title="A Plan for Spam" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">Bayesian Filtering</a>, and luckily Mozilla has this technique integrated.</p>

<h2>I report Spam to the provider of the Spammer</h2>

<p>Depending on my time (usually not a lot), I send a complaint to the provider of the Spammer. I open up my Spam folder, analyse all messages and send a message to the provider of the originating mail server and sites mentioned in the text.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to find out who is the responsible, but fortunately this can be partly automated as well. I use the <a href="http://www.spamcop.net/">SpamCop</a> notification service, to report Spam. SpamCop analyses the email, works out the likely true sender of the email, looks in the body to find any advertised email addresses or web sites, and then emails the administrators of all the systems involved to let them know about the problem.</p>

<p>SpamCop tells me whom the notification will be sent to, so I can remove any incorrectly targeted reports from the list.</p>

<h2>I don't buy</h2>

<p>This last one is quite obvious, but essential. Spammers send you messages to sell something. Sending millions of e-mail is cheaper than sending leaflets by snail mail, but still costs money. If I don&rsquo;t buy anything, they will have the costs but no profit. If we all just stop buying, Spam will stop automatically!!!!</p>

         	<p>The holidays are definitely over; I have spent my first day at the office again. Of course my colleagues wanted to know everything about my trip and of course I recommended them to visit Croatia as well.</p>

<p>Black polo shirts with the company logo arrived during my absence, and everybody except me was wearing those shirts in the office. Wearing the polo is more or less obliged, unless you have a reason to dress more formally. I don&rsquo;t mind wearing this <em>uniform</em>, since it is a nice shirt and saves me from making some wrong choices in that very difficult first hour of the day.</p>

<p>As expected, the work I left on my desk before leaving was still there, so today I continued working on the English version of the corporate site. I still need to translate some documents and have to create some screenshots of the software, but I hope to finish it this week.</p>

<p><a title="ICG. Software Factory" href="http://www.icg.es/eng/">The site is already live</a> but gives 404 errors for the pages that I still have to translate. In my opinion a bad decision, but since my move to the international department I have no influence on the design and technical side of the site anymore.

<p>That is how I would describe our short holiday to Croatia. We absolutely have the feeling that we should have stayed longer, since the country is sooooo beautiful.</p>

<p>We have seen a lot of nice things, but we missed visiting Split, Dubrovnik, Zagreb and Plitvice national park.</p>

<p>We did visit Rovinj, Pula, Zadar and the Paklenica national park. I could write a lot more about it, but I don&rsquo;t have the time for it.</p>

         	<p>The car has been thoroughly checked, my colleague has been informed of ongoing issues at my job,… I guess I am almost ready for holidays. There are only three things left to arrange before I will disappear for two weeks.</p>

<p>First at home. Tomorrow I will clean our house and do some shoppings (we only have yoghurt and beer in the fridge!). I also have to ask our neighbours to take care about our plants; they are very thirsty with this weather.</p>

<p>Then I have <a title="International Federation of Catholical Parochial Youth Movements" href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Fimcap</a>. I need to finish the on-line edition of the Link magazine June edition. Besides that I need to activate a page I already created on which you can <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/en/activities/en_worldcamp_2003_news.shtml">read live news from the World Camp</a>, a Fimcap activity for youth animators in the Philippines. During the world camp, participants will write their stories on this page. Photos will be added later by the webmasters (of which I am one), since editing pictures, uploading them and creating the right HTML code is too difficult. I could have used some advanced blogging tool, but decided that for the moment NewsPro will do the job.</p>

<p>And finally I have to prepare the trip. We decided to go by car to Croatia, with a stop in Milano to visit Roberto. And that is about all we decided and have prepared so far. We don&rsquo;t know which road to take, what we can visit and where to stay in Croatia. I hope that MJ was able to buy a copy of the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/europe/croatia/">Lonely Planet</a> guide, because then I will have good faith in our trip.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am almost ready. The next two weeks it will be very quiet on this web site!</p>

         	<p>Today is Sant Joan, a free day in Catalonia. The night before Sant Joan is celebrated with big fires, fireworks and eating coca, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we did.</p>

<p>Today we celebrate Sant Joan on our own way, in our favourite quiet swimming pool in Alpicat. Tonight we will meet our friends and have a drink on a terras. That is our way of celebrating the start of the summer!</p>

         	<p>The good thing of buying a cellphone pack is that everything comes pre-configured. I have chosen the Movistar Activa pack with a Sony Ericsson T200 phone.</p>

<p>One small box containing the phone, a power adaptor, a manual for the phone, the Movistar Activa SIM card and the accompanying manual. In the shop they placed the SIM card in the phone, activated it and selected the right rate. I could use it immediately, everything was configured.</p>

<p>Everything? Well, no. I couldn&rsquo;t use WAP. Not that I really need WAP, but I prefer that everything works when I buy something. I intent to use WAP for only two tasks: check my bank balance if I want to purchase something expensive and to do some emergency browsing in case <a title="FIMCAP - Fédération International des Mouvements de Jeunesse Catholique d'Action Paroissiale" href="http://www.fimcap.org/">www.fimcap.org</a> is having problems.</p>

<p>Both manuals I received are user-level manuals (how do I send a SMS message) and hardly contain any technical details. So I changed the language from Spanish to English (somehow technical terms are easier to understand in English) and started browsing through the settings.</p>

<p>After trying out some options I found it: the phone was configured to use WAP over GPRS, while the prepaid Movistar Activa I use does not support GPRS by default.</p>

<p>This is really stupid, they deliver a phone and a SIM card bundled with WAP settings that don&rsquo;t function in this configuration!!!! It would be more logical to configure the phone by default to use WAP over GSM, and let the few people who do contract for GPRS configure their phones later!!!</p>

         	<p>Relax, relax, relax… I really needed to relax, and that is exactly what I have done.</p>

<p>Friday after work we met with some friends at the Tapas Gallery. First I had to convince them to sit outside in the comfortable terras, while they preferred the air conditioning inside. Even though we were eating some Patatas Bravas, Maria José and I were still hungry, so we headed to Telepizza for a pizza. What a horrible dirty place is that!!!! Next time we will phone them from home or go to the Burger King.</p>

<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2734 alignright" src="https://JeroenSangers.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1ce1b42acf.jpg" alt="Sony Ericsson T200" width="170" height="116" />
On Saturday morning I was supposed to clean our house, but instead of that I walked into town to buy me a new cellphone. I already figured out that I wanted a Telefonica Movistar prepaid number, since I am not using the phone that much and mostly to phone Maria José who also has Movistar. For the phone I only knew that I wanted one of the major brands, except for Motorola. After looking at the options in the shop, I chose the Sony Ericsson T200, a beautiful small device.</p>

<p>At lunch time, the temperature had risen to 38–40°C. With these temperatures, there are only two things you can do: stay at home (if you have air conditioning) or go to the swimming pool. We chose the last option as we don&rsquo;t have air conditioning. We headed to the amazing pool of Alpicat and bought a season ticket.</p>

<p>To my shock I received a reduction because of my age, I am definitely getting old!!!! For only €15 I can swim the whole summer.</p>

<p>When around 7 o&rsquo;clock the temperature was a little bit more bearable, we took a shower and headed to Carrer Major for some shopping. Maria José was in a buying mood, and as usual that meant that she could not find anything while I easily bought some new clothes.</p>

<p>The Sunday started late. I went downstairs to Lo Panet to buy some croissants for breakfast and bought a newspaper, while Maria José made the coffee. After this slow start we cleaned the house and headed to Alpicat to help my in-laws preparing the lunch.</p>

<p>The rest of the day&hellip; swimming pool!!!</p>

         	<p>I always thought that the Internet would not be suited to learn a language, because it is better to learn from a real teacher who can explain things to you.</p>

<p>Once again Mark Pilgrim is two steps ahead of everybody. First, he started a Spanish site, to practice his Spanish a little bit (I know, I should also write in Spanish on this site), and I suspect also to have a good excuse to design a new site.</p>

<p>After announcing this new site, a second message for the Spanish speaking readers appeared, asking for Spanish curse words, dirty words and insults. I guess he just wants to built a filter for the comments on his new site.</p>

<p>Anyway, the amount of reactions and the contents of these reactions is impressive! I learned some wonderful new expressions (the best/worst until now: <em>&ldquo;Estás tan buena que te comería la regla a cucharadas&rdquo;</em>), and surely will keep on watching the new comments on this post!!!</p>

         	<p>The temperature is around 35°C for over a week now, during the day you hear a lot of complains about the heat, in the evening people live on the cool streets.</p>

<p>Everybody runs to the beach in the weekend, Lleida is getting empty. And not only here, <a title="Russell Beattie Notebook" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell Beattie</a> made the same observations in his entry <a title="Russell Beattie Notebook - Monday, June 16, 2003" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030616.html#214841">Small Spanish Towns</a>.</p>

<p>The holiday season is approaching, so we are thinking about what to do. We have two short periods to get away: the first two weeks of July and the first two weeks of September.</p>

<p>We were planning to visit the Netherlands in July together with my in-laws (they never went abroad), but we are not sure if they recovered enough from their <a title="Braintags: Aplec del Caragol" href="/2003/05/aplec_del_caragol/">car accident</a>.</p>

<p>If not, we will try to go in September. The other short holiday we plan to take our car and drive to Croatia, with a short stop in Milano to visit our friends Roberto and Francesca.</p>

<p>Maybe we will also stop in Venetia. Besides travelling we also want to have some days to stay at home and relax, since lately we hardly have time to be at home.</p>

<p>Then there are also some people visiting us. The most important ones are my parents, who will be here on August 12–19. My mother has not seen our finished house yet; the last time she was here was in July 2002, when we just started the reconstruction of our house. My father has visited us two times more, mainly to work in our house.</p>

<p>The truth is that we haven&rsquo;t made a lot of progress since he <a title="Braintags: Working" href="/2003/01/working/">last visited us</a>. Therefore we plan to finish some more small things, so my father doesn&rsquo;t get the impression that we don&rsquo;t do anything (keeping up appearances)…</p>

<p>Yesterday Roberto phoned us from Italy to tell that he and Francesca are going to spend some time in the beginning of August in Catalonia, and surely will visit us. Yes, we are definitely looking forward to the summer!</p>

         	<p>I love technology. I just love it. And I love computers, cellphones, PDA&rsquo;s, digital camera&rsquo;s and other geek toys. The only thing is… I don&rsquo;t have them!!! I used to have some fine toys, but they have been stolen <a title="Braintags: Another visit" href="/2003/03/another_visit/">some months ago</a>.</p>

<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2736 alignright" src="https://JeroenSangers.micro.blog/uploads/2020/5fa61dc71a.jpg" alt="Palm III" width="179" height="200" />My biggest proud and useful gadget was my Palm III PDA, shown above. It contained my agenda, addresses of friends, family and clients, books to read at lost moments, games and passwords (encrypted of course!). Without realising it, I used my Palm daily, and was very happy with it. But… no Palm at the moment!</p>

<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2737 alignleft" src="https://JeroenSangers.micro.blog/uploads/2020/279ef15c8e.jpg" alt="Samsung SGH-N400" width="260" height="210" />The other gadget I owned was a Samsung SGH-N400 cellphone. I specially liked the design of this phone (by <a href="http://www.pininfarina.it/">Pininfarina</a>). But is was easy to use and had all the functions I need (vibration, WAP, small size, &hellip;). But… no cellphone at the moment!</p>

<p>I do have some computers, three in total. It is not the quality of them but the amount that make them geek toys. My desktop computer is the most advanced of the three, with a Cyrix P-133+ processor and 48Mb of memory. Yes, I know it is not that impressive. But after I reinstalled everything lately it runs faster that the mega computer I use at work. I did keep some room on the harddisk to install Linux to have even more pleasure. But… no Linux at the moment!</p>

<p>You might think that I must be a sad geek without any toys, but that is certainly not the case. I don&rsquo;t have any toys, because I am looking around to decide what toys I am going to buy. Alright, I could go into a shop and buy the latest and the greates phone, PDA and computer, but that is gonna cost me an awful lot of money.</p>

<p>First of all I decided that I don&rsquo;t need a fancy cellphone. If I have time I will buy a prepaid number this weekend, and I will probably start using a second hand phone. For the moment that will be enough, since I don&rsquo;t phone a lot and neither plan to use any other functions.</p>

<p>I will also keep on using my old computer. It is fast enough, and with a little bit of extra memory, a wireless connection to the ADSL router and <a title="Gentoo Linux" href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Linux</a> installed I sure will have lots of pleasure of it.</p>

<p>That leaves me without PDA. Palm recently released a new model, the <a title="Palm Products - Zire 71 Handheld" href="http://www.palm.com/products/handhelds/zire71/">Zire 71</a>, which kicks ass! It has a built-in camera, so it gives me two toys for the price of one. The only problem is the price, which is around €300. I will have to think it over a few more times, but I am afraid that I am going to buy it…</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/06/12/internet-explorer.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-06-12 16:42:05 &#43;0100">Jun 12, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Lately a lot of talk has been going on around Microsoft&rsquo;s web browser Internet Explorer (IE). This is my contribution.</p>

<p>First I want to go back in history. The first graphical browser <a href="http://dejavu.org/1993win.htm">NCSA Mosaic 1.0</a> was available in 1993 (I was one of its happy users). After a little bit of hesitation Microsoft jumped on the internet train with their Internet Explorer. Between that moment and the year 2000 Microsoft came with 6 versions of their IE browser.</p>

<p>At that moment they had a huge monopoly in the browser market because of their monopoly in the OS market, and they sat back and relaxed.</p>

<p>Now, three years later (30% of the time since the creation of the World Wide Web!!!), we are still stuck with the same version, and it looks like we will have to deal with it for two more years, since Microsoft announced that they will only deliver their browsers together with Windows, and the next version of Windows (Longhorn) is <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/11.html#a3302">scheduled for 2005</a>.</p>

<p>I think they are making a mistake. It is true that they have the monopoly, but more and more people are switching to other browsers. Furthermore, technology is advancing.</p>

<p>More and more sites appear that make use of features that IE doesn&rsquo;t support, giving users a less than perfect browsing experience. At this moment the majority of the sites still uses code specially tweaked for IE, but little by little site designers start using <a href="http://www.maccaws.org/">standards compliant code</a>. And everybody knows that conforming to standards is not Microsofts strongest point. Their philosophy is ‘<em>what the monopolist uses is the standard</em>’.</p>

<p>That is why IE6 does not fully support CSS2, a standard created two(!) years before they created IE6.</p>

<p>But this is not why they are loosing users. After all, users don&rsquo;t care about these things, the web designers have to make sure their pages are coded well. But IE6 is also behind on the user interface side.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> has nice features as a pop-up killer, an image manager to block unwanted images and a site navigation toolbar which lets me navigate through this site using the arrow keys on my browser.</p>

<p>Everybody is free to choose their browser, but I prefer a more modern browser than IE, which misses one third of the development of the Internet. At home I have installed <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/">Mozilla Firebird</a> which has an install file of only 6 MB. Although is is still beta software, it runs perfectly on my old computer and gives me a lot more browsing pleasure than the browser installed by default.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/06/11/http-error-gone.html">HTTP Error 410: Gone</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/06/11/http-error-gone.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-06-11 11:29:19 &#43;0100">Jun 11, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It has been a while since I changed the backend of my site from NewsPro to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>.</p>

<p>A side effect of this change was that all pages changed URL, which I considered a minor problem since most people enter the site through the home page (which did not change).</p>

<p>Normally I try to keep URL&rsquo;s the same, but the old system used horrible filenames like <code>1025286960,58049,.html</code> and stored all files in a single directory.</p>

<p>Like I said, most visitors enter the site through the front page, but there are some people looking for specific information with search engines. Until today these visitors were presented a ‘404 Page not found’ error page of my provider directly followed by the <a href="http://www.hypermart.net/">homepage of my provider</a>. In other words, these visitors end up at a completely useless page, and won&rsquo;t ever visit my site anymore!!!!</p>

<p>Something had to change. First, I wanted to change the error message from 404 (Not Found) to 410 (Gone), since the latter message is more precise. All visitors looking for never-existing files will still get the old 404 message. I read about this code a while ago on <a title="HTTP Error 410: Gone [dive into mark]" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/03/27/http_error_410_gone.html">dive into mark</a>, and I kept it in mind for using it on m own site.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to show them another page, which at least links to my site. For the moment I chose to present them the <a title="Seach Braintags" href="/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi">search page</a>, so at least they can search my site for the information they are looking for.</p>

<p>I am planning to create a separate error page explaining what has happened in more detail, but until now I will just show the search page.</p>

<h2>So how did I set this all up?</h2>

<p>The Apache server has the ability to specify configuration options in a file called <code>.htaccess</code>. The settings in this file are valid for the current and all underlying directories, and thus can be overruled by another file.</p>

<p>I created this file in the root directory of my site and added the following information:</p>

<p><code>ErrorDocument 410 /cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/cgi-bin/newspro
RewriteRule cgi-bin/newspro/(.*) - [G,L]</code></p>

<p>In &lsquo;normal&rsquo; language, these lines say the following:</p>

<p>The first line says that the page at <code>/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi</code> (which is my search page) has to be shown in case a request has status ‘410: Gone’.</p>

<p>The second and third lines activate and configure a module for the Apache webserver calles <a title="Apache module mod_rewrite" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>, which allows me to process the next two lines.</p>

<p>The fourth line defines the condition to me used for the rewrite. It says: if the requested URL starts with <code>/cgi-bin/newspro</code>.</p>

<p>The last line specifies what has to happen if the condition above is met: rewrite <code>cgi-bin/newspro/<em>.</em></code> with nothing (-). Besides the rewrite (which does nothing) two options have been specified: G and L. The first changes the status to Gone (410), and the L tells that this is the last rule to process.</p>

<p>In short: if the URL contains <code>/cgi-bin/newspro</code>, the status will be changed to Gone, and when error 410 (Gone) occurs, the search page will be shown.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>With fancy e-mail I mean HTML mail.</p>

<p>Most mail applications are able to send (and receive) messages in two formats: text only or HTML, and most applications use HTML by default, which is a <strong>BAD THING</strong>.</p>

<p>People like to use HTML e-mail, because it looks nicer with all those colors, fonts, pictures,… and therefore most software companies like it.</p>

<p>But for writing a simple “Hello, how is life in Lleida?” message you don&rsquo;t need bold words nor blue titles. Plain text is probably better readable than that piece of art some people create.</p>

<p>There are of course always cases in which HTML mail is better, but usually that has to do with Viagra marketing, and those messages are deleted immediately.</p>

<p>You might think that even if you don&rsquo;t use fancy effects, HTML mail could not harm anybody, could it? Wrong! There are a number of reasons why I (and many other people) consider HTML mail harmful:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>HTML mail wastes bandwidth</strong>
HTML code adds usually 200% to the size of the message. I know, for your short message this is only a very little bit, but if I have been away for the weekend and find tens of HTML messages I urgently want to read, I get nervous when I am waiting 5 minutes (yes, I am using a slow modem) while it could have been finished within 2 minutes!</li>
    <li><strong>HTML mail is more vulnerable for viruses</strong>
This is a really important one. By using HTML mail, one of the main security principles are broken: separate code from content. HTML mail (content) can contain scripts (code) that virus writers exploit. Many of the famous Trojan Worms would never have been spread around if people would have used plain text messages by default.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML mail can connect to the internet</strong>
This is something used a lot in spam. They include an image which is stored on their server and insert it into the message with some kind of parameter. The moment you read the message, the image is fetched from their server, passing the parameter to the sender of the message. The result is that your e-mail address will be listed as ‘verified’ and therefore will receive more spam.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML incompatibilities</strong>
Most people who create websites know how difficult it is to create a page that looks alright on all mayor browsers. Guess what? E-mail clients have the same problems! The message that looks perfect in your Outlook Express can look completely different on the computer of your sister, who uses Eudora to read her mail. And there are still people around with mail applications that don't support HTML at all!</li>
    <li><strong>HTML mail is slow</strong>
Plain text messages only have to be shown on screen, but ‘rich’ messages need preprocessing. Especially on old computers the difference is very clear. Wait, hasn't your neighbour still got that old-timer Pentium II? Better send him plain text next time, I am sure he will appreciate it! This does not only go for old computers, but more and more people start reading their mail using PDA's or cellphones.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short: unless you have very good reasons to use HTML mail, I would ask you to send plain text messages. If the appearance of the message is so important, you&rsquo;re probably better off by sending it as a PDF attachment or publishing it on a web page; those media are suited better for this task.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The reason we went to Harmelen last weekend was of course the wedding of Berry and Manon. Besides that, we took the opportunity to rest a little bit after the last busy weeks.</p>

<p>As a result, we have spent most of our time (except for Friday) on the terras in the garden of the house of my parents.</p>

<p>But Friday was different, since that was the <strong>big</strong> day; the day we came for.</p>

<p>After getting up late, taking a North-European breakfast, and waking up under the shower we realised that most of the morning already has passed, so we started to run to get ready in time.</p>

<p>Thursday we had a lot of time to wrap our presents in paper and prepare our contribution to the book with personal notes from the guests, but as usual I waited with these things until the very last moment.</p>

<p>With a little bit of running we arrived exactly on time at the house of Manon&rsquo;s parents.</p>

<p>Together with the family of Berry and Manon and some of their best friends we drunk a cup of coffee with some cake. We talked a little bit with Ton and Mirjam, who had brought their two children, of which I haven&rsquo;t seen the youngest (Daphne) yet. As you can imagine there were lots of things to talk about. After a while Berry and Manon arrived from their photo tour, and they looked gorgeous! Of course they were really happy to see us, and we had a small opportunity to talk a little bit.</p>

<p>Because the weather was great, we were able to walk to the centre of Harmelen, were the old ‘monastery farm’ (now a restaurant) provided a beautiful ambiance for the official ceremony.</p>

<p>There were barely enough chairs to fit all the people present, and the ceremony was not too oficial with regular jokes about Berry&rsquo;s talent for playing darts, friends through thick and thin, and of course the hassle with the ‘stoofje’ under Manon&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>Since we were in such a romantic place, Berry and Manon had chosen to use some time for some pictures together with the family, witnesses and friends in different combinations.</p>

<p>After sending Loek to the supermarket to get us some water, we walked to the church.</p>

<p>The mass was also really nice, although a little bit long. I participated as a witness, but was surprised to see that my role was only that: witness the rituals. I did not have to sign any document! Maybe if I would have been on the oposite site, I could have had an additional function by trying to catch Berry when he accidentally almost fell from the altar.</p>

<p>Anyway, after hearing them say “yes” and seeing them exchange rings for the second time, we were absolutely sure that they were married, so it was time to party.</p>

<p>Besides that we were very thirsty, and as a result we arrived first in ‘De Putcop’, where the reception would take place. Since it was already late, we quickly sung the welcome song prepared by the family, cut the pie, congratulated the couple and sat down to (finally) have a drink.</p>

<p>While we were relaxing and talking at our table, more and more people entered. Both Berry and Manon are very active Harmelen, Berry in <a title="The national Jong Nederland organisation" href="http://www.jongnederland.nl">Jong</a> <a title="Jong Nederland Harmelen" href="http://jnharmelen.nl/">Nederland</a>, <a title="Soccer Club Harmelen" href="http://www.sch44.nl/">SCH</a>, <a title="Darts club The Pirates" href="http://www.vdlit.tmfweb.nl/pirates/">the Pirates</a>, de <a title="Carnavals Vereniging De Kwakbollen" href="http://www.kwakbollen.nl/">Kwakbollen</a>, and Manon in EHBO.</p>

<p>After filling our stomachs we were ready again for the final party, with even more people than appeared on the reception. I tried to speak at least some minutes with all my old friends, but one evening is by far too short for this. At least I (and Maria José as well) had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Sunday before leaving home again we visited Berry and Manon at home. We watched (parts of) the video made and talked a lot about <em>the</em> day…</p>

<p>Wednesday they will leave to Florida, where they will visit Disney World (they are huge fans of Disney) and have a cruise through the Caribbean.</p>

<p>I wish them a good time, and hope to see them soon again.</p>

         	<p>A while ago I wrote about my old <a title="Braintags: Photo gallery" href="/2003/05/photo_gallery/">Image gallery</a>, and gave a link to the gallery since I didn&rsquo;t create the navigation tabs yet.</p>

<p>The gallery was created using a script called ‘Image Arcadia’ which is not supported on a public site anymore. Although it worked alright, it still needed a lot of customisation to fit into the rest of the site.</p>

<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-2839 alignright" src="https://JeroenSangers.micro.blog/uploads/2020/f9e41051e3.jpg" alt="qp_banner" width="88" height="31" /></p>

<p>Recently I run across <a title="Quixotic Pixels: stylish &amp; fun web design" href="http://quixoticpixels.com/?qp=photoblog">PhotoBlog</a> from Quixotic Pixels. This is a set of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> templates, allowing me to manage my images the same way I manage my texts, without having to install extra scripts.</p>

<p>I uploaded some photo&rsquo;s from my old Photo Gallery and used the default blue style, and it looks alright.</p>

<p>The next time I will add all other photo&rsquo;s and I will adjust the look of the pages little by little until it fits with the rest of the site. There is still a lot to be done…</p>

         	<p>Two more days working and we will go for a short trip to Holland!!!</p>

<p>The reason is of course the wedding of Berry and Manon on Friday. We will leave Thursday early in the morning, giving us one day to travel, shop, talk with my parents and of course to prepare us (physically and mentally) for the big day.</p>

<p>Berry and Manon will get married ‘for the law’ in <a title="Restaurant de Kloosterhoeve" href="http://www.kloosterhoeve.nl/">Restaurant de Kloosterhoeve</a>, which I consider a good choice, since it has a lot more atmosphere than the town hall in Woerden and is situated in the centre of Harmelen.</p>

<p>The religious part of the day will take place in the St. Bavo church, and the party will be in <a title="Restaurant De Putkop, Harmelen, specialiteiten, zakenlunch, bruiloft, terras" href="http://www.putkop.nl/">Restaurant De Putkop</a>.</p>

<p>I am really looking forward to this day, firstly because it is an important day for some of my best friends and secondly because I will meet a lot of people to whom I haven&rsquo;t spoken for some time. And finally, I always like to go back to Harmelen.</p>

         	<p>The calendar shows it is weekend…</p>

<p>Time to arrange our house and enjoy the weather. We urgently need a sun tan before leaving to Holland next Thursday. Can you imagine that we will be the whitest persons on the wedding of Berry and Manon? Nobody will believe we are living in the south of Europe.</p>

<p>Therefore we will be going to the beach tomorrow. Usually we go to Vilafortuny, which is a quiet place between Salou and Cambrils, about 70 km from Lleida. Surely we will leave early in the morning, as we expect whole Lleida to head to the water, and stay there until the early afternoon. The afternoon we will probably spent walking through the village, sitting on a terras or enjoying our life in another way.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The lesson of this weekend is: always study the program carefully.</p>

<p>Of course I looked at the program of the <a title="Web Oficial del Aplec del Caragol de Lleida" href="http://www.aplec.org/">Aplec del Caragol</a>, but I quickly came to the conclusion that we would only join the meals on Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon, and of course the parties on Saturday night.</p>

<p>We decided to skip the parade on Sunday morning, simply because we didn&rsquo;t want to wake up at 8 o&rsquo;clock after a ‘heavy’ night. If I would have read the program better, I would have known that I could just as well have joined the parade, since they were passing our house anyway.</p>

<p>The parade is a quite curious thing, and there is no way to continue sleeping when they pass your house. You have to imagine that the world famous <a title="Carnavals Vereniging De Kwakbollen" href="http://www.kwakbollen.nl/">Kwakbollen</a> Brass Band is passing your window 20 times in half an hour, with in between hundreds of people who continued partying the whole night without sleeping. Noise enough…</p>

<p>A funny habit is to throw water on the persons passing your window (ours was just too far from the street to do this), so all participants will be ‘fresh’ again for another day on the Aplec.</p>

<p>When we were cleaning the space of our colla after the Aplec, bad news arrived. The parents of Maria José had an accident with their car and had to go to the hospital for some research. While her brother and sister went to the hospital, Maria José and I went to their house to take care about the grandmother and the dog.</p>

<p>Last night Maria José slept in the hospital in the room of her parents, and I stayed in Alpicat. Both of them are reasonable OK, with a lot of browses and glass cuts in their faces. The mother of Maria José has a broken shoulder and will probably be operated this week.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Eating and drinking…</p>

<p>I guess that will be the central theme for today and the coming days.</p>

<p>This lunchtime I went to restaurant ‘La Tapa’ with 23 colleagues to say goodbye to a colleague. For me this was a great opportunity to see my other colleagues again, since I work only with a few people in the commercial department, and all the others are in another building. It also was nice to see the new faces and connect them to the voices I have heard over the telephone.</p>

<p>Tonight we are going to have a supper at the house of the parents of Maria José, to celebrate the birthday of her grandmother. We will be bringing some <em>coca de recapte</em>, and together with some tortilla&rsquo;s and a little bit of Cava (Catalan Champagne) my first culinary day will be complete.</p>

<p>But after that the party will begin. This weekend is the weekend of the <a href="http://www.aplec.org/">Aplec del Caragol</a>, the snail party. The motto of the weekend says it all: <strong>12.000 participants, 100 clubs, 200.000 visitors, 12 tons of snails</strong>.</p>

<p>To get a better impression, change the word club in something like ‘group of friends with their family who has their own place to eat, drink, meet, listen to (live) music…’. There is no way to describe the Aplec, it is something you have to experience, and preferably in a colla (group). As any year, we will be with the whole family in the colla called ‘Picarol’.</p>

         	<p>I wrote the last entry on this site exactly four hours before the start of the ‘Festa Major’ en Lleida. This morning I have been working again, so it is exactly four hours after festa major.</p>

<p>We had a great weekend! I think that we have seen all the highlights of the weekend, and in between we took the time to enjoy our free time. We have spent quite some time shopping for clothes. Maybe it was because our wardrobe looked empty after removing the winter clothes and clothes we never ware anymore.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to a big factory outlet in a small town called Roca de Vallès. For those who don&rsquo;t know: in a factory outlet you can buy the clothes the factory does not want to sell in the normal shops because of small errors or because the model is outdated or experimental. You have to look carefully, but you can find good quality for a very sharp price.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the women&rsquo;s fashion is so horrible at the moment that we couldn&rsquo;t find anything for Maria José. And all we were looking for was a normal pair of jeans (unbleached), a white collar-shirt and a jeans jacket.</p>

<p>Later on that day, the deception of the morning was balanced by the wonderful show of the <a href="http://www.miclleida.org/">Moros i Cristians</a>. First we saw the parade through the city and in the evening they presented in a spectacular way how the Moros conquered Lleida from the Christians.</p>

<p>On Saturday we didn&rsquo;t see much of the party. We went shopping in town and relaxed at home. In the evening we had some friends for supper. After supper (which was around 1 o&rsquo;clock) we went to the ‘regional houses’. Just outside Lleida on the fair grounds you could eat and drink specialities from different regions of Spain. It reminded me of the typical evening at Euroforums, where each country presents their typical culinary specialities. Only here tens of thousands people were trying to get the best. We usually hang around the bar of Galicia. The difficult thing is to find your friend in this huge audience.</p>

<p>Besides food and drinks there were also some concerts, of which I only remember that they were horrible. They told me that one of the artists has represented Spain on the Eurovision song contest…</p>

<p>The surprise of that evening was when I noticed someone who looked very familiar to me, only I couldn&rsquo;t remember why. He came to us and when he started talking I knew it.</p>

<p>Pietro had participated in a few Euroforums and is the nephew of the former Italian representative Marco. He told us that he is living in Barcelona since a few months, and he came to Lleida to party.</p>

<p>Yes, <a href="http://www.fimcap.org">Fimcap</a> is like a small family…</p>

         	<p>Being a user of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable type</a> and a player of <a href="http://www.blogshares.com">BlogShares</a>, I have been looking to combine those things: it would be awesome to see Blogshares information on my site.</p>

<p>After looking around a little bit, I found <a title="David Raynes: MTBlogShares" href="http://www.rayners.org/archives/000215.php">MTBlogShares</a> from <a href="http://www.rayners.org/">David Raynes</a>. His plugin lets me publish all kinds of information from BlogShares on my site, but the one thing I have been looking for has not been implemented yet.</p>

<p>So David, if you read this, could you implement this in your plugin for me, since my programming knowledge is by far not as good as yours:</p>

<p>Using your plugin it is possible to obtain the URL of each stock&rsquo;s BlogShares page. The only thing that I want is a possibility to remove the string <code><a href="http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=">http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=</a></code>, so that I have the URL of the site in question.</p>

<p>This allows me to create a list with links to sites I own shares of. As soon as the BlogShares spider visits my site and picks up those links, the total value of the blogs I have shares in will increase, making my shares worth more.</p>

<p>Well, what do you think about this idea? I think a lot of people will use your plugin if you have implemented this option.</p>

         	<p>As I continue defining the information shown on the main page, I find the list of archives by date way too long.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about how to solve this problem. The nicest way would be to group all dates by year and make a dynamical menu showing the months when clicking on the year. This would requiere some advanced JavaScript, and visitors without JavaScript would still see the whole list.</p>

<p>I went to look for other solutions, and came across <a title="Brad Choate: Year Archives in MT" href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/000890.php">Brad Choate: Year Archives in MT</a>. Brad describes a way of creating a page showing a year calendar. I guess I&rsquo;m going to implement this the coming days…</p>

         	<p>Whenever I am talking to somebody in Holland, one of the first questions asked to me is: “How is the weather?”.</p>

<p>The truth is, the weather here is not so interesting as it is in Holland. Over there you never know what to expect, it my rain, it might be sunny, it might be cloudy… everyday something else. Over here it usually is warmer than in Holland, and usually we have a sunny or partially cloudy day. Nothing special.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re still interested in the situation here, please read the <a title="Weather Underground: Lerida, Spain Forecast" href="http://english.wunderground.com/global/stations/08171.html">weather report on Internet</a>. It appears that there are two amateur radio stations in Lleida publishing weather reports, so you will always be able to have updated data.</p>

<p>The Spanish magazine <a title="Actualidad Economica" href="http://www.actualidad-economica.com/">Actualidad Económica</a> has done a <a title="Ciudades para vivir y trabajar" href="http://www.expansion.com/ae/firma/2341/jvelasco.html">research for the quality of life in the 52 capitals of the Spanish provinces</a>, and Lleida ended on the 2<sup>nd</sup> place!!!</p>

<p>The have looked at the price of living, mobility, services, educational possibilities, the character of the inhabitants and the political situation. All those factors seem to be alright here in Lleida.</p>

<p>The most remarkable conclusion from this research is the top position of the Catalan cities, with Girona and Lleida on the first two places and Barcelona on the fifth place.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s definitely great to live here!</p>

         	<p>Q: How long does it take me to put my signature on a paper?
A: Over 5 hours!!!</p>

<p>To get my new passport, I had to fill in a lot of papers. I did all I could at home and send the whole bunch (request form, photo&rsquo;s, police report,…) to the <a title="Consulaat-Generaal der Nederlanden te Barcelona" href="http://www.cgholbar.org/">consulate</a>.</p>

<p>Last week they phoned me and told that they had sent the whole packet to Holland, but that I still had to come to Barcelona to put my signature on a paper. And this could not be done by post, but had to be done in person at their office.</p>

<p>So this morning I left home at 8 o&rsquo;clock to enjoy the traffic jams of Barcelona. After three hours I parked my car, I went into the office, put my signature and within 10 minutes I was standing on the street again. Two hours more in the car, and the morning was finished and I was home again.</p>

<p>Still I am very lucky, because since I live so far away from Barcelona, they are going to send my new passport to me by mail. People living in Barcelona are also ‘obliged’ to come and get their passport at the consulate, but for me they are willing to do this favour. The girl at the desk even told me that I don&rsquo;t have the pay the cost of sending it!!!!!</p>

<p>This must be my lucky day&hellip;</p>

         	<p>Now that I have a wonderful new CMS able to produce RSS <a href="/index.xml">feeds</a>, I have been looking for a way to use it. My idea is to create a page showing the latest headlines from some news sources (see the list in the side bar), so that I don&rsquo;t have to visit each site.</p>

<p>I have found some applications (so called news aggregators) which do this, but until now I haven&rsquo;t found a good web service offering the same service.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to install an application, since I want to access this information both from home as from my work as well as when I am on holiday. My idea is that I don&rsquo;t have the same bookmarks on all those locations, and by offering a web page the information is always available.</p>

<p><a href="http://server.com/WebApps/NewsApp/">NewsApp</a> is the closest to my ideal I could find, but it lacks configurability and has the layout of an early alpha release.</p>

         	<p>Easter in Spain is something special. On ‘Semana Santa’ everybody takes a small holiday and leaves town to spend a few days in the mountains or at the beach. You can not imagine how silent and empty a city can get until you have visited a city at Easter.</p>

<p>Maria José and I also planned to go away for some days (but <a title="Easter 2002" href="/2002/04/a_short_holiday/">not to Holland</a>), but finally decided that after working so many weekend to make our home perfect and comfortable, we should take the opportunity to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Of course, four days at home is a little bit too much, so to start our short holiday we headed to <a title="ANDORRA - el país dels pirineus - Turisme / Turismo / Tourisme / Tourism" href="http://www.andorra.ad/">Andorra</a> to do some shoppings. The typical items people buy in Andorra are gasoline (we made sure that our tank was empty when arriving—the difference in price was €0,10 per litre), sugar (we bought enough), perfumes, cigarettes (unfortunately we don&rsquo;t smoke), clothes (it appeared that most shops have the same owner, must be a rich guy!!!) and electronics (at the moment we don&rsquo;t need anything).</p>

<p>We took our swimming clothes with us to visit <a title="Caldea, Principality of Andorra, the largest health spa in Europe" href="http://www.caldea.com">Caldea</a> <a title="Training course Fimcap secretariat" href="/2002/01/training_course_fimcap_secretariat/">again</a>, but after a day shopping we preferred to go home instead.</p>

         	<p>You might have noticed the <a title="BlogShares -- Fantasy Blog Share Market" href="http://www.blogshares.com/index.php">BlogShares</a> logo on my web site. This is because last week I started trading on their fantasy blog share market. The principle is very simple:</p>

<p>Instead of buying shares for companies you virtually buy shares for weblog sites.</p>

<p>The value of a site depends on the incoming links. This very sites has no incoming links from other weblogs, so that leaves my website worthless. However, my outgoing sites are worth a little bit, so by linking to other sites, I add value to these sites.</p>

<p>The rest functions just like the normal stock market. Everybody starts with $500 and can buy virtual shares. At this moment my assets are worth $745, which I think isn&rsquo;t bad, but compared to some big players this amount is insignificant.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Contents</strong>.
I have imported all the news items from my old site. The last days I have reviewed them all and corrected spelling errors, updated expired links and categorised the items. It was fun to read everything again, from <a title="I am here, but all my stuff is there..." href="/2001/10/i_am_here_but_all_my_stuff_is_there/">moving to Lleida</a> to <a title="Aplec del Caragol" href="/2002/05/aplec_del_caragol/">local culture</a> to <a title="Update" href="/2002/09/update/">reconstructing our house</a>;</li>
    <li><strong>Structure</strong>.
In the next step I will create the structure: decide which information will be shown, and where does it come. I will start with the main page, and then do the archive and individual pages;</li>
    <li><strong>Presentation</strong>.
The last part will be the fun part. In this step I am going to edit the style sheet to define how each page looks (colours, fonts, borders, images…)</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, plenty of work left for the next weeks.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday I started installing Windows 98 on my computer WITHOUT A LICENCE!!!</p>

<p>I know that it is illegal, but I have some reasons for doing it. First of all I think that I will only use Windows 98 temporary, and will be able to switch to Linux or <a title="freeBSD" href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> soon.</p>

<p>Secondly, Windows 98 is a product that is not supported anymore by Microsoft, and I doubt if I still can buy a licence. But even if I could, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it.</p>

<p>So today I entered the world of <a title="Google search" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=serialz">serialz</a>, my god how I hate this! Especially since I was doing it on my old laptop which was slowing down with each pop-up showing.</p>

<p>Now that I almost finished installing the operating system, it is time to start thinking about the applications I need. I have made this small list:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Microsoft Office 97
Also highly illegal, but I think my computer is just too slow for <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>;</li>
    <li><a title="WS_FTP Pro - FTP Client for connecting to FTP sites" href="http://www.ipswitch.com/Products/WS_FTP/">WS_FTP Pro</a>

    <li><a title="My favourite editor" href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/">HTML-kit</a>

         	<p>The worst part of the site redesign is done.</p>

<p>I just changed the CMS application form the old NewsPro (which is not supported anymore, the creator is now working on <a href="http://coranto.gweilo.org/">Coranto</a>) to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. Until now I am very positive about MT, I even was able to import all my old NewsPro posts!</p>

<p>The site now shows the default Movable Type layout and design, which is not ugly at all.</p>

<p>The coming weeks I am going to study the Movable Type templates and little by little create my own style.</p>

         	<p>Alright, the legs of the table in our working room are there. My old computer is unpacked, the boxes are thrown away.</p>

<p>After some problems I got the computer to work. I decided not to install the scanner, since is is quite big, and I never use it anyway. If I really need to scan something, I can always connect it temporary…</p>

<p>Now I have to reinstall all the software. I could clean up the current installation and copy my files from my laptop, but I have been playing with this machine for years, and I think it is best to start from zero. I am sure I don&rsquo;t need any file or application, since I didn&rsquo;t use this computer for the last 17 months.</p>

<p>First I was thinking about installing only <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Linux</a>, but to get working quickly I think it is best to start with a small Windows 98 installation.</p>

<p>After Linux is fully operational, I only have to change the boot loader. And it is always handy to have a copy of Windows available, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p><code>B9 d++ t+ k s+ u- f i o++ x&ndash; e+ l- c&ndash;</code></p>

<p>In fact, the blogger code is nothing but a lame copy of the <a href="http://www.geekcode.com/geek.html">good old</a> <a href="/2002/07/geek/">Geek Code</a>.</p>

         	<p>It has been a while ago since I last updated my page. The stats show that it doesn&rsquo;t matter since people are visiting my site anyway, but I feel a little bit guilty about it. It is not that I haven&rsquo;t got anything to tell. There are things happening in my life, but mostly I am waiting.</p>

<p>Waiting for the arrival of the legs of our desk, so I can remove my computer from the boxes and check if it still works after spending 17 months stuffed away in a little corner.</p>

<p>Waiting to see if my computer works, so I can finally buy a Wifi PCI card to connect to the neighbours ADSL line. Why pay a lot of money if you can share, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Waiting for the <a href="http://www.cgholbar.org/">Dutch consulate</a> to tell me when my new passport will arrive. I just sent them the request form, and I know that it takes at least three weeks to have the new passport, but I want to be sure that I can go to the Netherlands for a small party in the beginning of June.</p>

<p>Waiting for Easter, when I will have some days off to relax a little bit. We have been thinking about going away for some days to the Basque Country, but finally we decided to stay at home and relax a little bit. Of course we will go to the beach one day, and for sure we are going to do some nice things the other days as well.</p>

<p>Waiting for inspiration to write something more interesting on my site…</p>

<p>This morning I went to the police station to pick it up. It was still in the wallet I keep it in, but the other things like my passport and my Aino business card have disappeared from the wallet.</p>

         	<p>After we had some visitors from Barcelona last weekend, this weekend we had visit from Switzerland. Karin and her boyfriend are having a holiday in Catalunya, and decided to visit us last weekend.</p>

<p>I know Karin since my first <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">Euroforum</a> and have met her and her friends several times in different countries in Europe. Two years long I went to Switzerland in summer, to help them with their summer camp, and every time I crossed Switzerland I tried to make some time for a stop in Luzern. The last years however I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of contact with her, so it was a pleasure to see her again.</p>

<p>They arrived on Friday evening, while I was still at work, so they had to wait a little bit at home. They didn&rsquo;t mind after walking two days through Barcelona.</p>

<p>After my work we went for a beer in <a href="http://www.virtual-lleida.com/osullivans/">O&rsquo;Sullivans</a>, after which we would meet Maria José and go to a restaurant.</p>

<p>However, when we wanted to leave the place, I noticed that my jacket was gone. I knew 100% sure that I had put it on the chair right behind us (and we were almost in the corner!), but it just wasn&rsquo;t there anymore. After searching around a little bit, we knew for sure that the jacket had been stolen.</p>

<p>I informed a waitress, who told me that the day before had happened the same thing. Without jacket (including cellphone, Palm III agenda, passport and drivers licence) we walked to the restaurant, where Maria José tried to phone to my phone. It was still ringing, but nobody answered (as expected).</p>

<p>We enjoyed a nice mail at Pastificio (pasta of course), brought our guests home for a beer and went to the police.</p>

<p>On Saturday I showed our guests around in Lleida. We visited the usual things like the Seu Vella, Carrer Major, Seu Nova, &hellip; We also taught them wat a ‘siesta’ is.</p>

<p>On Sunday, after enjoying our breakfast, we prepared some sandwiches and drove to Ulldemolins. There, we took a drink and started walking into the mountains.</p>

<p>After almost two hours we were up on the mountain, almost 500 meters higher than where we started. We ate our sandwiches, and said goodbye to our guests. They were going to walk some hours more until they arrive in Montsant on the other side of the mountain, where they would have to find a place to stay. We walked back to our car and drive back home. Notice that this is not the normal way we leave our guests!!!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Catalan government broadcasts a commercial on television urging immigrants to <a href="http://cultura.gencat.net/llengcat/">learn Catalan</a>. If you live in a country, you have to learn the language of that country, isn&rsquo;t it? I completely agree with this point of view, but then why don&rsquo;t I speak Catalan myself????</p>

<p>When I decided to move to Catalunya, of course I decided to learn the local language.</p>

<p>Over here, there are two languages spoken: Spanish, which is the official language, and Catalan, which the people living here all speak in daily life.</p>

<p>I decided to opt for Spanish for a number of reasons. First of all, Catalunya is not so big, and Lleida is close to the border of Catalunya; if I drive 25 kilometres I am in a Spanish speaking area. Furthermore, Spanish is a language spoken all over the world, at least more than Catalan, and all people here speak Spanish besides Catalan.</p>

<p>The only drawback of my decision is that I have to learn to understand Catalan anyway, since this is what all people speak over here, but that has happened just by listening to the people and living with them.</p>

<p>So after almost one and a half year living here I speak Spanish really well, don&rsquo;t I? Well, not…</p>

<p>The fact is that I hardly have studied since I lived here. I wanted to follow a language course, but all courses I could find started at hours on which I usually still am working.</p>

<p>So I depend on self-study. I have some books and CD&rsquo;s, and with a little bit of self-discipline it should work. Right! So the problem is my famous (lack of) self discipline.</p>

<p>Seeing the advertisement of the Catalan Government made me realise my miserable level of Spanish. I think I am going to look around for a Spanish course again, because this has to change!</p>

And once I have put them into place, I can finally unpack my old computer, and play a little bit again.</p>

<p>Furthermore we are going to select some curtains for our living room tonight. Once that is done only some things have to be done:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Put the doorframe of the bathroom and paint it.</li>
    <li>Buy lamps.</li>
    <li>Put a side table in the corridor.</li>
    <li>Make something to hang our jackets.</li>

<p>Completely in line to the amount of work spent designing the site (30 minutes), this change was also a quick and dirty job. On the left site you can see a new ‘tool’: the <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">blogroll</a>. This is a list with blogs and other journal-like sites I visit regularly.</p>

<p>For those people thinking that it would be a good think if Jeroen would for once spend a little bit more time to create a decent site: you are absolutely right, this site sucks big time. But at the moment it works. I do have some plans to host it on my own server, for first I need to finish our working room and get a decent internet connection.</p>

         	<p>Today I was going to write about the wonderful weather we have here in Lleida.</p>

<p>But something happened this morning that took away this desire to write about the weather.</p>

<p>When I went to work, I noticed that our car wasn&rsquo;t closed. I must have forgotten to close it yesterday. I thought to myself that I have been really stupid, and went inside.</p>

<p>On the chair next to me was a package of paper handkerchiefs, of which I didn&rsquo;t remember it being there yesterday evening. This made me a little bit nervous. I looked around, and indeed somebody had searched our car; the papers in the gloves compartment were in a slightly different place than usual.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find anything else, so I started the engine and put the radio to go to work. The weather was beautiful and sunny— dammit! They took my sunglasses!!!!!</p>

         	<p>Because I am working on Fridays until 20:00 hours, it is not possible for me to fly to Holland on Friday evening. So this Saturday we woke up at 4:30 to be able to catch the first plane to Holland, which is not funny if you have a birthday supper the evening before.</p>

<p>We arrived in Harmelen at the beginning of the afternoon, and watched how my father and the neighbours were busy with the enlargement of their houses. The last weeks they haven&rsquo;t been able to work a lot, due to the freezing cold in Holland (there are some things that I definitely don&rsquo;t miss…). Work is making steady progress, and in a few months my parents will have 2 meters more living room (which they need urgently now that Sven is visiting them once in a while).</p>

<p>After this we went with my mother to the center of Harmelen city, to see the carnival wagons. After being a participant for many years and missing the carnival last year, it was a pleasure to see it from the side. Of course half of the village was on the streets (with the other half standing on one of the 20+ wagons), and I met a lot of old friends.</p>

<p>After seeing all, we went for a quick shopping round, to buy the things we miss most (cheese, peppermint, brylcream,&hellip;), quickly brought everything home and went to the carnival party to have a chat with my friends.</p>

<p>That evening Esther, Terry and Sven came for supper. Sven has changed a lot since I last saw him two months ago. He has grown a lot, is smiling and even trying to talk. It was great to see him again.</p>

<p>At night it was <a href="http://www.kwakbollen.nl">carnival time</a> again. I dug up the old box with clothes and took out the pharaoh suit. Maria José chose my old clown suit; since it was already too big for me, it looked great on her. You can find a photo of us on my image gallery.</p>

<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock the music stopped and I heard Berry&rsquo;s voice through the microphone. This is what I already feared! I had to come to the front, and Berry explained in public that I came from Spain to celebrate carnival and my birthday in Harmelen. He gave me the present on behalf of the ‘brothers’: some Belgian beers, ‘dropjes’ and nuts (glad we didn&rsquo;t buy those that afternoon).</p>

<p>After waking up on Sunday and receiving the congratulations of my parents, we still had some time left, so we went to Montfoort to see the carnival over there…</p>

<p>In 1994 I was studying chemistry at <a href="http://www.uu.nl">Utrecht University</a>.

         	<p>After all the troubles described below, I decided to try to install freeBSD.</p>

<p>Since my laptop does not have a CD player I tried to install it over a serial cable connected to my other laptop, which does have a CD player. The laptop with the CD player runs Windows 98, which does not support this kind of connections. Therefore I booted it from my muLinux floppy and entered the basic configuration details. Funny how an operating system on a simple floppy disk can accomplish many things I cannot do with a 100+ Mb Windows installation.</p>

<p>Before this I already prepared two freeBSD boot disks to start up the setup procedure. I booted my laptop from the first disk, inserted the second disk when prompted, hit enter to start the setup program, and… reboot!</p>

<p>Time to read the manual (I know, I should have done that part before). Tried the same thing again, this time with the <code>boot -h</code> option, but with the same result. Mmmm… Maybe my floppies are corrupt, since I do remember having some troubles creating them. So I enter them in the other laptop, and they function perfectly…</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll have to do some more reading. One of the things I am thinking of is that my old laptop does not have a lot of memory, so maybe it is not able to contain the whole setup program.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In December last year, I described on this site how I installed <a href="http://mulinux.sunsite.dk">MuLinux</a> on my IPC Porta-PC laptop. I installed the WKS, SRV and X11 add-ons, so I had a working graphical user interface and the necessary e-mail (mutt) and web (lynx) applications. The only thing missing was the internet connection, and I wanted to configure my PCMCIA modem for this.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this was the moment that things started going wrong, I was not able to activate PCMCIA. As everybody knows, the power of Linux is that it is open source, so you can fix everything yourself.However, I am not a kernel hacker, so this option is unusable for me.</p>

<p>Instead I put all the <a href="http://mulinux.sunsite.dk/archive/9076.html">error messages in an e-mail</a>, and send it to the muLinux mailing list. Within an hour I had some responses, one of them being from Michele Andreoli, the creator of muLinux (try this with Windows!). They gave me some more options to try, but the conclusion was that in creating a tiny linux distribution, Michele had to cut out PCMCIA modem support (ethernet cards are supported however). Game over…</p>

<p>I do have a ‘normal’ serial modem which I could use to connect to the internet, but I want to use this modem as well for my desktop system. So the options are: using a serial modem or install another operating system which does support my PCMCIA modem.</p>

<p>After I finished school, the only sports I did was the weekly <em>paaltjesvoetbal</em> at <a href="http://jnharmelen.nl/">Jong Nederland</a>. But now that I&rsquo;m living in Lleida, I even stopped doing that, but it is time for a change…</p>

<p>As the title of this message already suggests, basketball became the sport of choice. It is one of the most popular sports here in Lleida, and the <a href="http://www.lleidabasquet.com">local club</a> is quite successful. I am not playing in that club, but only incidentally on Sundays together with some friends. We play on the square of the school oposite of our house, which I call our virtual garden (we only have a balcony).</p>

<p>Last Sunday was the first time I joined the basketball group. The weather was great, it felt like spring. And my muscles still tell me that I was playing too fanatically.</p>

<p>Next weekend I probably cannot play (good start, isn&rsquo;t it?), because Maria José and I plan to go to the pyrenees for some snow fun.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The site you are reading now is my 3<sup>rd</sup> personal web site. You might think that it is not <em>that</em> great, but you have to keep in mind that I created it in less than an hour. When I was making it, I was busy with my move to Lleida, and didn&rsquo;t have a lot of time to hack code. In fact, my intention never was to keep it this long, it should already have been replaced with something better!!! In my mind I am already designing V4, but it might take half a year more before you will be able to see it (first I have to finish our working room, so I can put a decent computer to work with).</p>

<p>One of the things I want to implement in V4 is a history of my sites, in other words, I will copy V3 as it is now (with only removing some interactive options), add V2 (I still have it on disk) and recreate V1 from my memories. The nice thing of the four sites together is that they show the development of personal web sites through the years:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>V1</strong>: I created my first site in 1993 when I was still studying. Internet was new and after playing with <a href="http://www.scn.org/~bkarger/gopher-manifesto">gopher</a> I installed Mosaic on my Macintosh and made my first page. In fact it was nothing more that a bulleted list with my favourite sites.</li>
    <li><strong>V2</strong>: In 1997 I bought myself a new computer with modem. With my internet connection came some space on the server for my personal homepage. I installed FrontPage (like everybody in that time), chose a nice theme and typed in my texts. Later I linked my CD database to this site, gaining a lot of links from music lovers.</li>
    <li>V3: The site you are reading now, created in 2001. In the meantime I had learned that FrontPage creates bloated, non-standard pages, so I created this site as a pure site. Written completely on Notepad. I installed two perl scripts (NewsPro and Image Gallery) to handle the dynamical content, and that's it!</li>
    <li><strong>V4</strong>: As my sites always have been used mainly for testing purposes, I will go one step further. V4 will be hosted on my own server, and I will probably use the Zope Application Server, with Plone on top of it. Besides my old sites, I will probably continue to write short stories about my life (even though I know that I am not the greatest writer), but I will probably split them into personal and technical stories. The comments feature is almost never used, so I will replace it by a conventional guestbook. I have a lot of other ideas, but I won't bother you with it now...</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides my personal sites, I have been working on three more sites. After V2 was up and running, I created (also with FrontPage) Youth Games, a collection of games in Dutch and English. The site was a big success, but I didn&rsquo;t have the time to maintain it. Another FrontPage site was the DDC (Dooie Donders Club) site. In fact is was the same site as V2, but with another theme. I hope that after I have created V4 I will have time to make another DDC site, but for this I need some help from my <em>brothers</em>. The site I currently spent the most time on is <a href="http://www.fimcap.org">Fimcap</a>, but I&rsquo;m sure you all have visited this site already&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Update 2003.06.11</strong>: In the mean time I have updated this site and imported all news items. Although in this message was written that you are looking at V3, in fact I would consider this V3.5 or even V4.</p>

         	<p>After five days of hard work, my father has gone home again.</p>

<p>The result of all this hard work? Four painted doors!!! I know, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it was a lot of work, but trust me, he did a lot! I have been wrestling with those doors myself before, and I can tell you that it takes a lot of time. The biggest problem is removing the old paint. The doors have been painted at least three times before, with three different types of paint. The oldest layer turns into some sticky mess as soon as you try to remove it, and turns into stone on your tools. Besides that, the fine structure carved into the doors don&rsquo;t make it easier to clean them…</p>

<p>Because of the hard work, my father did not have a lot of time for social contacts, which is a big crime in this country! Therefor all social activities were propped into Saturday.</p>

<p>In the morning we had breakfast in the house of a friend of the parents on Maria José. Since this was a special occasion, they&rsquo;d fired up the grill to prepare a big pile of meat (and that for breakfast!!!!)</p>

<p>After the breakfast we took a short walk through the yards and went home to prepare ourselves for lunch. After being home for only one our, we went to the house of the parent of Maria José, te eat soup, french fries and… a chicken!! I wasn&rsquo;t really hungry when I went for lunch (understatement), but after lunch I felt just as stuffed as the chicken I had been eating. I was happy to sleep a little after lunch (my father of course continued working), knowing that in the evening we would go to a nice restaurant to eat some more…</p>

<p>Yesterday my father arrived to fix the last important things, like removing the paint from the doors and painting them. When I came home for lunch today I was surprised: he almost finished the first door already! And he is staying until Sunday, can you imagine how happy we are!</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be a busy day in ‘Casa Sangers’, since Lilian and Ruud will visit us. They are having a short holiday in Barcelona this week, and will drop by for a day…</p>

        <a href="https://jeroensangers.com/2003/01/10/computer-tips.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2003-01-10 10:51:00 &#43;0100">Jan 10, 2003</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I spend quite some time behind the computer, at work as well as at home. Mostly I use the computer for only four things: read my e-mail, read some web pages, create web pages and write documents. Over years I have tried to make my life as easy as possible, and I would like to share here with you how I am doing. Although I use both Windows (98 &amp; XP) as Linux, I will focus here on Windows.</p>

<h2>Reading e-mail</h2>

<p>Did you know that there are two protocols to read your e-mail? We have POP3 and IMAP.</p>

<p>Most people use POP3, but IMAP is far better. Why? First of all, because IMAP leaves messages on the server, so you can see all your e-mail from any location (I know, web-based mail can also do this, but has a lot of other inconveniences). You can also create folders on the server.</p>

<p>At home I am still using a 28k8 modem to connect to the internet. If I want to read an important mail, but somebody has sent me a big file just before it, I&rsquo;ll have to wait for the big mail to enter first. Not with IMAP!!</p>

<p>With IMAP, first the headers of the messages are downloaded, and then I can decide which message I want to download to my computer. So I can skip the big message and read the important message first.</p>

<p>Like most people I am using Outlook Express for my e-mail. I know that I can install a better mail program, but why should I if OE comes preinstalled?</p>

<p>There are however some things that I really don&rsquo;t like about OE, but fortunately they are easily fixed.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is quoting. When replying to a message, Outlook puts the cursor and my signature above the original message. If after a while I want to read the entire thread of the message, I&rsquo;ll have to scroll down to the first message, read it, go up to the next message, read it, go up…</p>

<p>Anyway, it would be a lot easier if everybody would write their messages <em>under</em> the original message (and trim the message!!!!). I am using a very simple program that fixes this problem automagically: <a href="http://flash.to/oblivion">OE-QuoteFix</a>. By the way, when reading a threaded message, it uses colour coding to show the different replies. Really handy!!!</p>

<h2>Read web pages</h2>

<p>Lets continue with Internet Explorer. I use it not because it is the best, but because I can&rsquo;t deinstall it and don&rsquo;t have disk space for a better browser (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>). As somebody who designs web pages I can tell you how horrible IE is…</p>

<p>Even though it is a bad browser, it has some features that are unknown to many people.</p>

<p>For example, I really hate pop-up screens (I know, this site has them, but read on…). To disable them, I changed the security settings of IE so that JavaScript will be disabled (tools → internet options → security → internet → high). JavaScript is used by many web sites, but mostly for features that I am not interested in (pop-up screens, tracking of my behaviour, fancy menus, etc…). If I notice that a site really requires JavaScript, I simply add the site to my trusted sites. But until now that was only necessary for four sites.</p>

<h2>Create web pages</h2>

<p>I know that not many of you create web pages, so I&rsquo;ll keep it short.</p>

<p>The greatest tool I have found is <a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/">HTML-Kit</a>. It is free and can do a lot more than its name says (HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, XSL, JavaScript, VBScript, ASP, PHP, JSP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB, C/C++, C#, Delphi / Pascal, Lisp, SQL, and more). But if I need to quickly change something, I usually use Notepad (see below).</p>

<h2>Write documents</h2>

<p>One tip: You don&rsquo;t need Microsoft Word for everything!!!</p>

<p>Why not? Because the application is way too big (I only use 5% of the options), because Word files are way too big (ever received a Word document under 200k?) and more important: Word documents can only be read by Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>In other words, if I send somebody a Word document I force him to use a really expensive text editor!!</p>

<p>Most texts I simply write in <a href="http://www.notepad.org">Notepad</a>, since most texts are short and don&rsquo;t need any make-up. If I want my headers to appear in another font, I&rsquo;ll switch to <a href="http://aroundcny.com/technofile/texts/bkwordpad97.html">WordPad</a>. Easy enough, isn&rsquo;t it??</p>

         	<p>Today at lunchtime we have removed all the Christmas decoration from our house; the holiday season is definitely over.</p>

<p>As this was our first winter in our own house, we have bought the decoration little by little, some things even in Holland. But after the Three Kings (if you want to know how we celebrated it, <a title="Three Kings" href="/archives/2002/01/three_kings/">read my story of last year</a>) it was time to remove everything.</p>

<p>The result of this first year is a big box with decorations. The only thing we have to do is find a place for our tree. It is quite big (way too big for our little balcony or our patio) and at this moment it is blocking the entrance of the house. We will try to find a home for it next Saturday, and hope that it will survive until next year.</p>

<p>At least our living room looks a lot bigger now…</p>

         	<p>A new year has started, and it has started very well for me. This was the first time that we celebrated New Year in Lleida. We spend the last evening of the year with our family; eating, drinking, talking, watching television…</p>

<p>At midnight I participated in a typical (hilarious) custom: eat a grape on every bang of the clock, and thus ending up with twelve grapes in your mouth!!! Maria José was not able to finish her twelve grapes, because she was rolling on the floor laughing.</p>

<p>A little after midnight we went to visit a friend at home. She was supposed to go with us to the pub, but got ill that day (poor girl…). We had some more glases of cava, parked our car at home and went off to the <a href="http://www.pentagramasoulclub.com/">Pentagrama</a>. I always like to go to the ‘Penta’ because they play a lot of music from the eighties.</p>

<p>The next day we woke up incredably early, at twelve o&rsquo;clock. We had a short breakfast and a quick shower and went off to the new year&rsquo;s lunch. In the afternoon we were painting in our house. Since we are living there we haven&rsquo;t worked a lot, so it still isn&rsquo;t finished yet. This extra free day gave us the opportunity to work a little bit.</p>

         	<p>A warning for all people who want to see our house: do it fast!!!! We are already destroying our new house:</p>

<p>Yesterday at lunchtime I decided to check our e-mail. So I took my laptop and walked to my working room. Just when I walked into the hallway, the laptop slipped out of my hands and dropped on the floor. Immediately I looked down to see whether my laptop was damaged, but I noticed something worse: the laptop had hit the floor with its edge and had damaged our brand-new floor!!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After the basic installation of <a href="http://mulinux.sunsite.dk">MuLinux</a> earlier this week, I have been looking around and expanding the system during the last days.</p>

<p>The whole thing is mature and really well though out, with lots of user-friendly scripts and help files.</p>

<p>The core of the system is the setup script. This script is used to create configurations, and to configure modules. In the configuration is specified which modules are loaded and with what parameters. It is loaded during boot, so that all modules are loaded correctly.</p>

<p>To save a configuration as default simply type <code>setup -s</code>. To load a configured module MOD use <code>setup -r MOD</code> and to force reconfiguration use <code>setup -f MOD</code>. Setup also can be used without parameters, to start the setup menu. This menu shows all available add-ons and modules and lets you configure them from one screen. Besides setup, there are a lot more scripts. Even well known UNIX command like grep are implemented as a script. I was really impressed!</p>

<p>After looking around and playing with all options, I decided that it was time to expand the possibilities of my system. So it took the WKS (workstation), SRV (server) and X11 (X window system) add-on floppies and installed them from the setup menu.</p>

<p>The WKS add-on gave me applications like mutt, ssh, pgp, tyhe SRV add-on gave me samba, smail, web-based system administration and PCMCIA support. X11 has the x-windows system with VGA-16, fvwm95, Afterstep and wm2.</p>

<p>At this moment I had an incredible amount of features, using only 4 diskettes. I played around a little bit again, and started configuring xf86 to have a graphical interface.</p>

<p>Usually this is the most difficult part to configure, since you need to know a lot of parameters from your system (OK, not in the modern Linux systems), but MuLinux was perfectly able to configure X using its probe feature. After 5 minutes I had a screen like this:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2607" src="https://JeroenSangers.micro.blog/uploads/2020/af046ce7e7.jpg" alt="MuLinux fvwm95" width="640" height="480" /></p>

<p>Not bad, isn&rsquo;t is? For next week, I&rsquo;m planning to get Internet connection. First I want to put the PCMCIA modem from my Toshiba into the MuLinux machine (which is by then an IPC Porta-PC P5E-486/DSTN) and get it connected to Internet. Furthermore I want to try to connect it to another computer using a LapLink cable. And maybe, I&rsquo;ll download some more add-ons (GCC TCL TEX PERL EMU JVM NS1 NS2).</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t finished playing yet!</p>

         	<p>Yesterday morning I found the official invitation for the company christmas dinner on my desk, the dinner was going to take place the same day. Fortunately we already new about the dinner for one week…</p>

<p>After work, I first went to our office in Torrefarrera to receive the traditional christmas box, this year with a lot of alcohol and chocolate.</p>

<p>Then quickly home to change clothes. Since this was my first Christmas dinner, I didn&rsquo;t know the dress code. I knew that a suit would be overdone, but to be sure I decided to take a tie with me and decide whether to wear it or not at the restaurant when I see how my colleagues are dressed.</p>

<p>The dinner was really good, but I could expect that from this restaurant (<a href="http://www.goldenweb.es/infolleida/petitcatala/">Petit Catalá</a>). One thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the distribution of the tables. They decided to keep all departments together, so I shared the table with the colleagues I work with every day, while I would have liked to talk more with the colleagues I don&rsquo;t see so often.</p>

<p>At one o&rsquo;clock we finished, but because we still had a lot to ‘discuss’, we went to <a href="http://www.virtual-lleida.com/smilingjack/">Smiling Jack</a>. Today I can see my colleagues having troubles keeping their eyes open…</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One month ago we moved to our new house. Since then, things have settled down, but one thing still is missing: our working room still serves as a storage room, with my old computer packed into boxes.</p>

<p>Until that moment we both use my (even older) Toshiba Satellite Pro 400 CDT. This computer is not really fast, but in the mean time I have gotten used to it. It&rsquo;s really comfortable working on the sofa, but to connect to internet I have to move to the floor of the hallway. For the moment we have this solution, but sometimes one computer just isn&rsquo;t enough for two people.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I dug up my <em>really</em> old laptop, a 486 with 8 Mb memory and 525 Mb harddisk, but without CD player. I once installed Windows 98, but it wasn&rsquo;t running perfectly. Besides this, I don&rsquo;t have a licence for this machine, and don&rsquo;t want to buy one. Therefore I decided to install GNU/Linux on it.</p>

<p>Taken the absence of the CD-player and the minimal hardware, I started looking for a floppy-based distribution. I once used the <a href="http://jspiro.tripod.com/linux/hal91.htm">HAL91</a> distribution, but this only runs on a RAM disk, while I want to be able to install it onto my harddisk. Then I found <a href="http://mulinux.sunsite.dk">MuLinux</a>, a tiny single floppy based distribution with the ability to copy the installation to the harddisk, and with some add-on floppies to install additional features like the X-Windows system, Wine, TeX, … It looked promising, so I set to work.</p>

<p>While the disk images were downloading to my Toshiba laptop, I started the other laptop from a DOS bootdisk to format the harddisk. It had quite some bad sectors, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a big problem. In the mean time the download was finished. I extracted the DOSTOOLS to <code>C:\mulinux</code> and copied the images (BOOT, WKS, SRV en X11) to the same directory. Next, I runned <code>unpack.bat</code>, which opened the main archive <code>mulinux-13r2.tgz</code>. Then I fired up makefi.bat, which created an installation disk. Since muLinux distribution running from floppy, installation means preparing the floppies. After the installation disk was prepared, I rebooted my Toshiba, after which the installation process prepared the BOOT floppy.</p>

<p>I immediately took this floppy to my old laptop and booted it with it. It booted nicely and started the configuration procedure. The first thing I had to do was configure the swap space. The harddisk was DOS formatted, but I want to install my linux on a ext2 partition. Therefore I decided to boot the machine with only the necessary configuration, after which I should be able to use the linux fdisk utility to partition the harddisk. For the moment I configured the swap space as a file on the DOS partition and continued.</p>

<p>After configuring the swap space I had the option to load each of the available add-on disks. After selecting No for each of them, a configuration menu was presented with three options: No additional configuration, a minimal configuration or a custom configuration. I selected the minimal configuration, and Linux continued loading its applications onto the RAM disk.</p>

<p>At the end I was asked if I wanted to save these settings as default (which I did not since I want to change the partitioning) and then I was offered a tour which I also declined.</p>

<p>Finally I was presented with the prompt, indicating that I could start to work. This prompt is a silly thing, since the multi-user options are on the SRV add-on. Anyway, I enterer root (just for the show) and fired up fdisk. I quickly deleted the DOS partition and created an ext2 partition and a swap partition.</p>

<p>I rebooted the laptop, and went through the same procedure again, but this time I used my new partition as swap space and did some more configuration, like the keyboard layout.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my time to play with computers is finished for today, so I saved my configuration to the floppy (<code>setup -s lock</code>) and shut down the machine.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I am going to copy the files from the RAM drive onto the harddisk and if I have enough time left, I am going to install the SRV and WKS add-ons. That will keep me busy for a while…</p>

<p>We left in the morning to Alpicat to visit Maria José&rsquo;s parents, and I didn&rsquo;t think about my phone.</p>

<p>When we came back home at 20:00 hours, I had two messages on my voicemail; one of my sister and one of my mother. Their message: I have become an uncle!!!!!</p>

<p>My sister&rsquo;s son is called Sven, weighed 3,5 kilos and is 52 centimetres long. Both of them are alright.</p>

         	<p>Barely 2 weeks after we moved into our new house, Hotel Rosell had its first guests: Coen and Duh Nieze. They are spending a week of holiday in Catalunya (a good choice) and were in our house this weekend. We showed them around in the city (but we didn&rsquo;t visit the Seu Vella), and explored the local culinary specialities (without eating snails) and nightlife.</p>

<p>Because Coen proudly wrote in the guestbook of <a href="http://jnharmelen.nl/">Jong Nederland Harmelen</a> about the beer we took outside on the terras, we sent them to the pyrenees, where for sure it&rsquo;s impossible to sit outside to drink a beer. They did report having had a snowball fight with the local priest.</p>

         	<p>We&rsquo;re now living in our new house for one week now, and things have settled down a bit.</p>

<p>The first days were a little bit chaotic. We found out that we didn&rsquo;t have hot water, so we had to improvise a bit with taking showers and washing the dishes. Our dishwasher still isn&rsquo;t working, because the hole in the closet where the tubes and the power cable of the dishwasher go through has been made in the wrong location. If things go alright they will fix this today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Last weekend I fixed the beds and the wardrobe in the second bedroom. When that was finished we could finally unpack a lot of the boxes in our office, which looks a lot cleaner now. We also could clean the entrance, which have been a storage place for some months and haven&rsquo;t been cleaned thoroughly during that time.</p>

<p>On Sunday we invited the parents and the grandmother of Maria José (the people who helped us so generously with this house) for lunch. A little bit of stress in the morning because we wanted everything to look perfect <em>and</em> serve a good meal. And yes, we succeeded!</p>

         	<p>Yes!! If everything went right, this afternoon the heaters will be connected and the floor will be finished. That means that our house is ready enough for us to move in. Last week, Marie José already moved some stuff, and tomorrow I will finish this. When she comes home from Austria on Sunday, we will start a new phase in our life together.</p>

<p>Of course we will send out our new address to everybody, but I haven&rsquo;t had the time to do so this week.</p>

The only comment I would like to make is that all of this is happening right after the first elections I didn&rsquo;t participate. A coincidence??? I don&rsquo;t think so…</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided to try to vote on the next occasion in January. I found out that I have to register in Den Haag, which I did today. Six months before the elections they are going to send me a form (I haven&rsquo;t received anything in June…) and after returning it, I will receive my voting card three weeks before the elections.</p>

<p>As usual, a lot of paperwork, but I&rsquo;m used to it. Let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>

         	<p>Last weekend we spend almost completely working in our house, from early in the morning until it was too dark to work (we haven&rsquo;t got light everywhere yet…). And I can honestly say that we&rsquo;re fed up with it!</p>

<p>I have spoken to people who told me that they like to work in their house to relax a little bit after working in the office, but I rather have a beer in a bar to relax.</p>

<p>This weekend I prepared the walls for painting; filling the holes, taping off the windows and the doors, etc. Maria José helped me and started painting our living room. Now all we have to do is put the paint on it. We hope to have time for it this week, but I think that we&rsquo;ll have to do it next weekend.</p>

<p>Besides working ourselves, other people also have to do their jobs. If everything goes well, this week they&rsquo;ll put the marmer and the electodomestics in our kitchen, connect the toilet and the shower, finish the electrical installation and maybe come to put the floor. But our experience until now taught us that things rarely happen on their planned schedule, so we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s going to happen this week.</p>

<p>At least we have five days to get some fresh energy for the work of next weekend…</p>

         	<p>Guess we&rsquo;re just plain busy at the moment&hellip; Anyway, it&rsquo;s about time that I give you all an update about life in Lleida.</p>

<p>Last weekend we had a good excuse not to work in our house: Marcel and Rebecca were in town and we spend the weekend with them sightseeing. We had a great time, but afterwards felt a little bit guilty about the time we <em>could</em> have worked in our house.</p>

<p>Speaking about our house, things are going well. We have new windows and out bathroom and kitchen are almost finished. In the mean time we&rsquo;re trying hard to paint the walls. In fact, we&rsquo;re only waiting for the moment that the new floor arrives, and we&rsquo;re ready to enter our house. This afternoon we&rsquo;ll hear the date for that, hopefully they&rsquo;ll be able to do it next week.</p>

<p>Friday my father flies over to help us with the work as we have a short holiday. On Wednesday October 30th we&rsquo;ll fly over to Holland to spend some days over there. After that, I&rsquo;ll stay some more days as a business trip.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the moment…</p>

         	<p>I guess some people are missing their weekly update about my life. Not that nothing happened in my life the last couple of weeks, but I just didn&rsquo;t feel like writing. For all people addicted to news about me, here is an update.</p>

<p>First of all our house. The planning was that the kitchen should have been placed two weeks ago. But unfortunately the worker hasn&rsquo;t finished the prepatory work (electricity, water, floor, ceiling,…) yet. We hope that he&rsquo;s going to finish it this week, so within a week or two we&rsquo;ll have our new kitchen (which will be the first room completely finished then). In the mean time, we have started painting the ceiling of our bedroom. All in all, it looks like things are finally getting better!</p>

<p>Secondly, my professional life. These weeks my colleague is on holiday, so this gives me some more responsabilities and work. I&rsquo;m now communicating with distributors and clients in Holland, Australia, Bolivia, Mexico, U.S.A., … Strangely enough I find that in a lot of places Dutch people are working, and as a result I&rsquo;m speaking Dutch half of the time.</p>

<p>Finaly my personal life. This weekend we had once again visitors from Holland: my sister and her boyfriend. For them it was the last change to visit us for a while, since after December they will have to take care about their little child (we don&rsquo;t know yet whether it is a boy or a girl, although we guess it will be a boy). We showed them the ruins which will become our house and of course we went to see some of Lleida&rsquo;s touristic highlights. In the evenings we explored some of the culinary habits over here. For them it was the first time to have supper at midnight, and I discovered that this Italian waiter could speak fluently Dutch. We were really happy with their visit. After visiting us, they spend two days in Barcelona. If everything went right, they are now home again.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will leave early in the morning and drive up to Nouan-le-fuzelier, where we will meet my parents on a camping. Tuesday we continue and hope to arrive in Harmelen at the end of the day.</p>

         	<p>The last two weeks of August and the first week of September, Maria José and I hope to have holidays. If everything goes well, by that time there won&rsquo;t be a lot of work left in our house, so we probably will take our little tent and leave the country.</p>

<p>Were we will be going? Surprise, surprise&hellip; Holland!!!</p>

<p>We expect to stay there about 10–12 days. Most of the time we will be in the house of my parents in Harmelen, but we also plan to spend some days camping on one of the beautiful campgrounds of the <a href="http://www.kampeerclub.nl">NTKC</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore we are thinking of visiting the <a href="http://www.floriade.nl">Floriade</a> (after all we are tourists from Spain&hellip;), and of course the <a href="http://www.sjampoo.nl/crespon/">Crespon</a> Tentfeest!! Besides that, we will fur sure visit some old friends and/or colleagues (quite a while ago, isn&rsquo;t it?).</p>

<p>Anyway, if somebody has more ideas or wants to see us again, just drop me a line and maybe we can arrange something.</p>

<p>The first moment was Saturday at lunch time. We had spend the morning searching for furniture and just decided to buy the furniture we have seen two weeks ago. Heading for this shop, we stopped for lunch. That morning we prepared our ‘bammetjes’ but instead we went to a restaurant at the beach. The food was great, the wine was great, the weather was great, we were on the beach, so we could take a bath after lunch and we had finally decided which furniture we want. Yes, at that moment we were very happy.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening my very happy moment was more simple. We were sitting on our terras drinking a beer, when I realised that I could spend hours like this.</p>

         	<p>La Seu Vella is the most important monument of Lleida. It is situated in the middle of the city, on top of a high rock, and as a result you can see it from far away. La Seu Vella consists of an old cathedral and an old fortress. Yesterday the cathedral served as the perfect housing for a baroque opera.</p>

<p>‘Los elementos’ was written by Antoni Lliteres (I also never heard about him) in 1704. It describes the relation between the four elements fire, water, earth and air, together with dawn, harmony, the time and the dead. But in fact the opera is about the political situation of Spain at that moment, where Felip d&rsquo;Anjou (fire) and Carles de Habsbourg (water) were fighting for the Spanish throne. Fortunately, everybody received the whole explanation on beforehand so that it was easy to follow.</p>

<p>The old cathedral had a beautiful atmosphere, but for the acoustics it was way too big. Also the chairs were really uncomfortable, but what disturbed me the most was the fact that the musicians had to stop in the middle of the opera to adjust their instruments.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the quality of the artists was high, the costumes expressed the right atmosphere and the opera was entertaining. All this made it 5 quarters of listening and viewing pleasure.</p>

         	<p>So far, things are going well. The worker has done a nice job; he removed one wall, and moved two doors to another position. In the mean time we (or better: mostly MJ) have removed one wardrobe in the hallway and are working hard on removing the paint from the doors and the door posts.</p>

<p>Now it is time to start building up again. We are still hoping to move in shortly after the holidays, but this depends mainly on the moment our furniture is going to arrive. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll keep you informed…</p>

         	<p>Although 2 months ago we started working in our new office, the office has been inaugurated officially yesterday. The last week a lot of people have been working very hard to make everything spick &lsquo;n&rsquo; span. A new gate, small white stones around every plant in the garden, repair the basket ball net, finish the kitchen in our guesthouse. Inside we cleaned everything and I supplied the two vacant desks with brand new <a href="http://www.hp.com/desktops/professional/e-pc/">HP e-pc</a>&rsquo;s and Samsung TFT screens. We also created a nice screensaver with the ICG logo.</p>

<p>Before the guests arrived, the mayor of Lleida was shown around in the office and the gardens. I was ‘lucky’ enough that he was waiting for our CEO next to my desk, so I could have a short talk with him.</p>

<p>Present were the representatives of the local government, the biggest clients from Lleida, some other relations and our distributors from Andalucía, Madrid, Portugal and Mexico.</p>

<p>The mayor revealed a memorial stone on the wall, the CEO and the mayor held their obligatory speech, and then we could enjoy the cava, tapas and live classical music in the gardens.</p>

<p>Some people already told me that the new office looks like the house off a mafia godfather. Well, yesterday with this set-up and all the people in suits with sunglasses walking around, I certainly could agree.</p>

         	<p>After some months of preparations, yesterday the big work finally started. OK, we already did some small things, but yesterday the worker we hired for the big works started.</p>

<p>And he started well! In one day he removed the wall between a bed room and the salon, giving us a bigger living room. Besides this, he is going to close one door, move two doors, lower the ceiling of the kitchen and the bathroom and install the kitchen and the bathroom. Plenty of work for the next weeks&hellip;</p>

<p>To celebrate, MJ and I went for a drink at Llobregat.</p>

         	<p>Once again I had problems with my e-mail account. It appeared that a lot of messages I have sent the last month(s) have not actually been sent! Or better: they never arrived.</p>

<p>When sending they were accepted by the SMTP-server, but there they have been deleted.
The problem is that I am using some forwarded e-mail addresses like mail@jeroensangers.com and jeroen.sangers@fimcap.org. Mail send to these addresses are being forwarded to another mailbox, to which I connect with my mail program.</p>

<p>So far no problem, but I also want to send e-mail using the above adresses. Therefore I change the ‘from’ field in my mail application. But now, a lot of providers don&rsquo;t allow this, to prevent spam. Usually, the SMTP server will reject your message, so your not able to send it. My latest provider however, accepted the messages, but didn&rsquo;t sent it further (yes, to /dev/null!).</p>

<p>At the moment I am looking for a new provider. Until that, I will not be able to send my messages using <a href="/">jeroensangers.com</a> or <a href="http://www.fimcap.org/">fimcap.org</a>.</p>

<p>(Sorry for this quite tecnical message, but I know that at least half of my readers DOES understand it. If you don&rsquo;t: just forget it…)</p>

         	<p>Sant Joan is an important saint over here. At least important enough to have a free day on June 24th. Combine this with the general strike last Thursday, and the result is that half of the country moves for five days to the beach.</p>

<p>Instead of the beach, MJ and I decided to move with our tent to a camping in the pre-pyrenees, next to a lake near Tremp.</p>

<p>As a result, this weekend we have done absolutely NOTHING. Every day we wake up quite early due to the heat in our tent, we ate some magdalenas with a coffee for breakfast, we took a bath in the lake, read a little bit in the sun, took another bath, etc…</p>

<p>After two days of sun it became clear again why they used to call me ‘zwarte’ (black).</p>

<p>We had a wonderful time together. We showed them the city, the place I work, the house we&rsquo;re going to live in, the place we&rsquo;re living right now. They also got to meet the parents of MJ and despite of the language problems they got along really well.</p>

         	<p>I have been working now for four days in the international departement, and so far everything goes really well.</p>

<p>The first two days, my colleague explained me all the ins and outs of FrontRetail, one of ICG&rsquo;s applications. And now I am working hard on the Dutch translation of this application.</p>

<p>Must be easy for me, not? Indeed, not! Translating is a lot more difficult than I expected. Partly because the structure of the two languages is different, partly because I started with a badly translated version, partly because some words have more meanings, but most of all because my lack of knowledge of accounting.</p>

<p>Furthermore things go great. The office is absolutely beautiful (I still have to try out the swimming pool in the garden), my colleagues are helping me a lot and I am helping them (being the only technician in the office). The small problems every new office have like the absence of a coffee machine and an airco that works as a freezer will be solved soon.</p>

         	<p>I have been working a little bit more than six months now for <a href="http://www.ricomack.com">Ricomack</a>. During this time I have got to know Ricomack and the mother company <a href="http://www.icg.es">ICG</a>. I also have been able to transform myself from AIX/UNIX oriented into a generalist, since I have been working with Windows 2000, Windows XP, RedHat Linux, routers, networking, Point-Of-Sale systems, printers, the ICG software, … I have to say that I really like my work, although sometimes the work is not exactly what I like to do (like repairing 10 year old PC&rsquo;s). But anyway, I feel comfortable in this company.</p>

<p>But last Friday I got an offer I couldn&rsquo;t resist. ICG wants me to be in their international ‘department’. At this moment this department is operated by only one colleague, who is responsible for both the international sales and support. And that combination sometimes is a problem, because it is hard to support other clients being on an international sales visit. So now I am going to help in the support.</p>

<p>This morning I packed my new PC and went off to the new office. Let&rsquo;s see what we can do here…</p>

         	<p>That&rsquo;s it, it is over now. The <a href="http://www.aplec.org/">Aplec del Caragol</a> has finished. The aplec is a big feast with &lsquo;eating snails&rsquo; as a central theme. But in fact it is a lot more. It is about eating, drinking, culture, meeting old friends, music, …</p>

<p>On the applec groups of people (collas) spent one weekend together on the festival terrain. There are about 120 collas, with each 50–100 members. Members pay an amount of money, for which they can eat and drink during the whole weekend. Every colla has it&rsquo;s own space on the terrain, provided with a small bar, tables and chairs, BBQ&rsquo;s and usually also (live) music. Every member wears the shirt and the scarf of his colla.</p>

<p>Some numbers: besides the 12.000 members of the collas, another 200.000 people have visited the aplec. In all, 12 tons of snails have been consumed!!!</p>

<p>The family of MJ is a member of colla ‘Picarols’ and I was lucky enough to be able to join their colla. Also to my luck, this colla wears white shirts with a blue print as opposed to others which wear white shirts with pink dots, purple shirts with green print…</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to pass all the collas and watch how every colla has it&rsquo;s own way of passing the weekend. Another thing which I like a lot, is that it is an activity for everybody. Sometimes three generations of one family are present on one colla.</p>

<p>There is only one backdraw: I think that if your not within a colla, it might not be as much fun. But maybe the 200.000 visiters think different about it… I enjoyed it a lot at least.</p>

         	<p>This week we are in the middle of two major parties in Lleida.</p>

<p>Last weekend we celebrated the ‘Festa Major’, because the patron of Lleida, St. Anastasi has it&rsquo;s day on May 11th. There were plenty of activities organised through the whole weekend. For MJ and I, the weekend was even more special, because we had some visitors from Holland to join us: Berry and Manon.</p>

<p>On Friday night we started calmly. After having supper in a restaurant we went to the Camps Elisis. There was a big festival terrain with some big bars outside, a luna park and a hall for concerts. OK, I have to admit that the concerts were not so good, but maybe that&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Boney M.</p>

<p>On Saturday we did some sightseeing (La Seu Vella) and saw the children in traditional clothes offer flowers to St. Anastasi. In the evening we went to see the ‘correfoc’ (difficult to explain, but it has to do with jumping and a lot of fireworks).</p>

<p>Sunday we saw the ‘Moros I Cristianos’. First the presentation in the streets of Lleida and later the show at La Seu Vella. Their clothes were really incredible.</p>

<p>The coming weekend there is another party, the ‘Aplec de caragols’. If I have time I will write about is next week…</p>

         	<p>One thing I noticed over here is that there is more paperwork. Maybe I only have this impression because I am an immigrant, but I think that in general people use more forms and official papers.</p>

<p>I am living in Catalunya for half a year now (yes, time flies) and today I received a notice that my request for a residence card is honoured. can you imagine: 6 months for reading a request, finding out that I&rsquo;m from the EU and approving it!!</p>

<p>The letter which told me all this was completely unreadable, because all the references to the different laws involved. Anyway, I am ready to collect my residence card.</p>

<p>All I have to do (if I understand it right) is take the blue form (type XXX, model XXX, approved by XXX and of course with four copies), go to the bank, pay 5,06 euros, take the signed blue form, the yellow form (type YYY, model YYY, approved by YYY, signed by my boss and of course with four copies), 3 foto&rsquo;s and the unreadable letter (number ZZZ, approved by ZZZ, and hey, without copies?) and bring it during working hours to their office.</p>

<p>Luckily MJ knows the procedure, and also knows that the address on the letter is not the right one. I love paperwork!!!!!!</p>

<p>Ah, and the best of all: after a procedure of 6 months I will receive a card that is valid for 4 months. In other words: I should have asked the next card in February!</p>

         	<p>Today is a special day. Not only because Barcelona is playing against Madrid, but also because today is Sant Jordi (you know, they guy who killed the dragon).</p>

<p>In Catalunya this day is celebrated by giving each other presents. The boys give a rose to the girls, and in return they receive a book. For me this looks like a good deal, since the average book costs four times the price of a rose.</p>

<p>So after work I went to town to buy a rose. This was not very difficult, since there were roses for sale on almost every corner and at every traffic light. Also books were available in plenty; Maria José bought a book of Alberto Vasquez for me.</p>

<p>On the news they showed the numbers of this day of books and roses (besides lot&rsquo;s of pictures of books and roses. Today the Catalan people bought 5,5 million roses (there are 6 million Catalans!) and 10% of the yearly volume of books was sold today!!!! Very impressive…</p>

         	<p>Sunday I wanted to write about the calçots. But after the calçots, I was too tired to write. And the days after I was luckily enough to have to work out of town, so I missed my 30 minutes of internet before lunch.</p>

<p>Anyway, three days ago was the day we had calçots; after all, it is the season for calçots.</p>

<p>The week before we (or better MJ) was arranging all the things and inviting our friends. The Saturday afternoon we spent cleaning the garage, so we could put there some big tables to eat on. When everybody arrived on Sunday, we first drunk a vermouth with some chips, mussels, olives, cheese…</p>

<p>Then the father of MJ arrived with the calçots. Calçot is family of the onion (I think it is leek / prei in Dutch), and over here prepared in a fire, so they are all black. You remove the black part, put the calçot through some special sauce and eat it like the Dutch eat herring. Delicious!</p>

<p>After the calçots we put some meat on the fire, and we finished with a big pie. To finish the activity good, MJ&rsquo;s sister Cristine and her boyfriend Pere told us that they had bought an apartment here in Alpicat.</p>

         	<p>Easter time is always a good period to have a short vacation. Usually the weather is getting better, and after the first busy months of the year, I really need a break.</p>

<p>This year was no exception, especially with the work we have for our new house. Therefore we decided to book a flight and rest. We didn&rsquo;t have to think long for our destination; we were looking for a beautiful country with nice weather and nice people. Yes, Holland!</p>

<p>With a little bit of phoning (only one call!) we found a nice hostel which fitted our needs perfectly: Hotel Sangers in Harmelen. It&rsquo;s really cheap and has big comfortable rooms which look just like somebody has been living there until not so long ago. A perfect place to relax some days.</p>

<p>On Friday night I explored the local night life. There is an amazingly big offer of activities in Harmelen. I decided to have a sportive evening, and went to watch the Crespon darts tournament, organised by Darts club <a href="http://www.vdlit.tmfweb.nl/pirates/">Pirates</a>.</p>

<p>Saturday after we woke up (quite late of course) we went shopping. First to the supermarket to buy all thing we cannot buy in Lleida like dropjes (zacht zoet), tijgernootjes, sup-a-soup tomato and cheese. Then we went to Utrecht to look for things for our house. We found a couple from Spain doing the same thing, but unbelievable for us they decided to buy paper serviets!!! Like we don&rsquo;t have paper towels over here!!!!</p>

<p>What can Catalan tourists do on an average Easter day? Since the shops were closed, we decided to go for some sight seeing. Our target was the river ‘Lek’ and the city Culemborg.</p>

<p>After getting the so-called fresh nose, we headed to Haarzuilens for a typical Easter custom: palm pasen. I can assure that the <a href="http://www.palm.be/">Palm</a> beer tasted really good! That evening we enjoyed another typical Dutch custom: gourmetten. And we were not the only ones leaving palm pasen for this wonderful experience. In short: gourmetten is a way to invite friends for dinner without actually having to cook! No wonder it&rsquo;s popular in Holland…</p>

<p>Of course we have bought a set for gourmet. After all, we want our Dutch visitors to feel at home when they come to Lleida.</p>

         	<p>It is almost easter, and easter is a wonderful time for chocolate lovers like me. I always eat a lot of these small chocolate easter eggs. Also here in Lleida they know the tradition of chocolate. Besides the traditional eggs, small sculptures are very popular. The most popular at this moment is Harry Potter, completely with a castle.</p>

<p>But the biggest sculpture is the one of <a href="http://www.prats.org">Prats</a>. Prats is local patisseria and chocolate maker, who creates every year a life size statue of a famous Catalan person out of chocolate. This year, Pau Gasol has the honor. Pau Gasol????? I have to admit that I don&rsquo;t know him well, but sport-lovers might know this famous basket player of the Memphis Grizzly&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>By the way, for people wondering what I am doing at my work, the web site of Prats is hosted on our servers and created by us…</p>

<p>And did I take profit of it? Well… not really. When I finish work, the sun has long gone. And we have to use the weekends to visit shops, because it is about time that we select our new kitchen, bathroom and floor.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday was the day of Saint Joseph. Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed this, but the fact is that my girlfriend is called MJ; and thus is named after Saint Joseph.</p>

<p>Here in Spain, people celebrate their saint as a second birthday, with a nice meal and presents from their family and friends.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people name their children after the saint of the day the baby was born, thus denying their child an extra wonderfull day with presents and attention!</p>

<p>One of this victims is MJ. Though her birthday was last Friday, it was close enough to her saint to celebrate it all together. Poor girl…</p>

<p>And even worse, her boyfriend didn&rsquo;t give her any present at all!</p>

<p>Anyway, for all the people who missed my birthday: my saint will be on September 30. So if you want a small party…</p>

Work on the Fimcap site, install freeBSD, find myself a new internet provider… But when I woke up this morning I realised that I would have to change my plans. You simply can&rsquo;t spend the day behind the computer when the sky is blue, the first trees blossom in beautiful pink and it&rsquo;s 18 degrees outside!</p>

<p>This morning we visited our future house again, trying to decide how we are going to reconstruct it. And every time we talk with somebody else, we are changing our plans again. Sometimes a little big frustrating, but I am sure that in the end we&rsquo;l get there.</p>

<p>And because we were thinking about our house anyway, we decided to continue this afternoon. So we walked through the streets of Lleida, visiting every kitchen and bathroom shop we found. And we realized that there are a thousand more decisions to be made…</p>

         	<p>Normally when we visit Holland, time seems to fly. That is why we decided to go on Thursday evening. The other reason was the wedding of Ton &amp; Mirjam on Friday.</p>

<p>Due to a little delay we arrived in Harmelen at 1:00 at night. Of course we had to spend some time chatting with my parents, so we went to bed quite late.</p>

<p>I planned to arrange some things and go shopping on Friday morning, but as usual it was impossible to get out of bed early enough. Somehow every visit to Holland feels like a holiday, and the first days of holidays I usually spent resting (=sleeping). Anyway, by the time we got up, we had to run through the shower, quickly grab a sandwich and hop into the car to arrive on time in the townhall. The ceremony was funny and entertaining and I know it&rsquo;s a cliché but the bride looked pretty.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we had some minutes left for shopping (dropjes, tijgernootjes, …). The rest of the time we spent reading on the sofa. First of all because the weather wasn&rsquo;t so good, but also because at home we haven&rsquo;t got a sofa.</p>

<p>The party at night was also really ‘gezellig’. I had a chance to have a chat with a lot of people, and was able to hear the latest gossip. I was so occupied with talking to all those people that sometimes I forgot that MJ doesn&rsquo;t understand any of it. (Sorry for that, next time I will take care of you a little bit more…).</p>

<p>On the same evening, Pere had arrived home, so Saturday we showed him Amsterdam and Utrecht. We found out that a Dutch guide is of no use at all in Amsterdam, because on the streets you&rsquo;ll find more Spanish tourists that citizens of Amsterdam and the people in the souvenir shops speak better Spanish that I do. We also found out why groups of British boys only visit the red light district when they are completely drunk: the girls look like truck drivers.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to <a href="http://www.stairway.nl">Stairway to heaven</a> to drink some beers.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we went back home again. Even though we had one day more, time seemed to fly. Next time, with easter, we&rsquo;ll try to stay even longer!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>First of all for all the people who have asked me the last weeks: Yes, they do celebrate carnival over here! Of course a little bit different than in Holland, but they definitely <strong>do</strong> celebrate carnival.</p>

<p>This weekend Roberto, our Italian friend, was visiting us. He choose a nice weekend to do so, as stated above. He finished his exams on Friday, had a party at night and went directly over to Lleida. So when he arrived on Saturday afternoon, we first offered him a hot shower.</p>

<p>After arranging his stuff, we hurried back to the city center to see the carnival parade. I guess it was at that moment that Jong Nederland received the yearly prize of honour (and with yearly I mean that JN is receiving it every year) for their wagon. Here the parade starts when the sun sets, and I have to admit that the wagons look really good with al these lights. There were about 30 wagons, mostly crowded with children. Popular themes were indians, the north pole, and vikings.</p>

<p>After the tour (at was already 21:00 hours) we took Roberto to an Italian restaurant. I know that it is quite a guess to serve pasta to an Italian, but this restaurant is really good. Nine is a little bit early to eat, but on these kind of days you have to be early, or you&rsquo;ll end up waiting a long time outside the restaurant.</p>

<p>After the meal, we went to <a href="http://www.rivercafe.es">River café</a>, which is close to the place where the party in the evening would take place. The main party started at eleven thirty, but at midnight the hall wasn&rsquo;t even half full. The band was playing really good, but Metallica and AC/DC are not the kind of music I expect on a carnival party. Around one thirty more people started entering the place, waiting eagerly for the main act: <a href="http://www.drcalypso.com">Dr. Calypso</a>. Dr. Calypso is Catalunya&rsquo;s most famous ska band, and guarantees a lot of pleasure.</p>

<p>The next day we didn&rsquo;t do a lot, as usual on Sundays. We helped Roberto pack his stuff, as he was moving on to the mountains of Vall d&rsquo;Aran for his first skiing experience.</p>

         	<p>One of the nicest features of having your own web site is playing ‘detective’.</p>

<p>Every day the web server produces a huge amount of data; every single page you request and every single picture on that page is recorded in the log files. I use these log files to see who visited me, when did I receive those visitors, what kind of computers do they use, which pages are the most popular, … But the most interesting is to know <strong>how</strong> they got onto my site. Especially the visitors which entered from a search engine are interesting, because they were looking for some information.</p>

<p>This week I noticed something strange in my logs: I received a lot of visitors who were looking for information about <a href="http://www.piazzolla.org/">Astor Piazolla</a>. I started thinking, because until I wrote this article, there is absolutely no mention about Astor Piazolla on this site. I have to admit that I like Astor Piazolla and his <em>New Tango</em> a lot; I even have some of his work on CD.</p>

<p>Aaaah, that&rsquo;s it! On my former web site, I maintained a list of all CD&rsquo;s I own. That list must still be in de databases of those web sites. But visitors of my old web site are automatically forwarded to the new one.</p>

<p>That only leaves the question why suddenly people start searching for Astor Piazolla. All the Dutch readers already know the answer, but I had absolutely no idea. Until I talked with my parents. Of course they told me about the big event in Holland: the wedding of Willem-Alexander and Maxima. And my mother told me that she liked the moment when Maxima showed some tears when they played Argentine music. And this piece of music (Adios Nonino by Astor Piazolla) is now nr. 1 in the Dutch hit charts. So thanks to the royal wedding I received a lot of hits.</p>

<p>Case closed.</p>

         	<p>Oops, already a week without any notice! Yes, it&rsquo;s about time that I write something new on my site. So I decided to write about the princess. Not the one of this weekend, but the one which I really missed last weekend.</p>

<p>As you might remember I made a small trip to Holland last weekend (exactly 24 hours and 10 minutes). O Saturday evening we went to the reception of the prince, organised by <a href="http://www.kwakbollen.nl">CV de Kwakbollen</a>. And the most important question on that evening is not who will be the new Dagobert (if you know the solution to 1+1, you&rsquo;re always able to figure out who he is), but how his princess will look. And if you know that Dago doesn&rsquo;t have any girlfriend or wife, the first question is WHO he chose to be on his side.</p>

<p>The tension was really high when Dago finally appeared. Of course we faked our surprise to see him (I <em>never</em> could have guessed it could be him…), but immediately everybody started looking around, searching for the princess.</p>

<p>But no–… to our disappointment, this Dago has chosen to celebrate carnival alone.
Alaaf for prince Remi XXVI!</p>

         	<p>I just noticed that I haven&rsquo;t written for a while about my job. And since quite some of the visitors of this site are ex-colleagues from MultiSystems/Avalix/Aino, I think that it is appropriate to write some words about my job.</p>

<p>The company I work for consists of three companies: <a href="http://www.icg.es">ICG</a>, a company which produces software for shops and small companies, <a href="http://www.ricomack.com">Ricomack</a>, a company which has a shop and delivers technical support, and finally CST consultants.</p>

<p>I work for Ricomack, in the department ‘internet’. This department consists of Xavi and me (and part-time Massimiliano). We handle all work which is related to internet activities and servers. Ricomack acts as a ISP for some companies, we host their web sites and their mail accounts. This is mainly the work of Xavi; he also designs the web sites (he started the one of Ricomack just today, so don&rsquo;t expect too much from this one).</p>

<p>My main concern is the installation of new servers for clients, all HP with Windows 2000. Besides that I also repair desktops and do a lot of other small jobs. Today Xavi and I decided to make our room more comfortable, so I ended up with a drilling machine to change the TL lights. As I said, I do a lot of different things.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am not so involved with UNIX anymore. Our internet server runs Red Hat, but furthermore it is all Windows.</p>

         	<p>No, I am not going to be the new secretary of Fimcap, but I was present at the unofficial training course. Wim from <a href="http://www.chiro.be">Chiro</a> was this weekend in Catalunya to talk with Carme, the former secretary.</p>

<p>And of course, if you come all the way from Belgium, you have to see something of the country.</p>

<p>On Friday evening he was shown the wild nightlife of St. Feliu de Llobregat (A.K.A. the town of the single women). On Saturday morning there was a meeting of the exchanges workgroup of CCCCCE, so I took Wim to Barcelona to walk around and show him that I don&rsquo;t know Barcelona very well.</p>

<p>After that we went with 8 people to Andorra. Why? To swim! Andorra has a really nice swimming pool, of which I already have forgotten the name, and we have spend the evening taking baths. Alveiro had arranged a nice cabin to sleep, in a house full of people who came to ski. I wonder if they knew how wonderful the swimming pool is…</p>

<p>Sunday morning we spent tax-free shopping, and then it was time to go home again.
And the training course? Well, I think that Wim will manage&hellip;</p>

         	<p>Until yesterday, we had two cars at home: the Pajero, used by the parents of MJ, and the Opel, used by MJ and her sister and recently also by me. Yesterday, the brother of MJ received his new car (a brand-new Peugeot 307) and so his old car is also available.</p>

<p>This car, a white Fiat Punto, is also property of the family, and for the moment MJ and I are going to use it. This gives some relieve, because it is not always easy to car-pool with three people having a different schedule and working at different places. Sometimes I was traveling (and waiting) for one hour, while it is only 7 kilometers from home to work.</p>

<p>This weekend we will have to clean the car, and we are going to put in some personal thingies. Of course the frog which I once received for my birthday from my three brothers will take it&rsquo;s usual place in the back of the car…</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I know that in Holland the big parties are over, but here there is one more event left: the Three Kings.</p>

<p>(By the way, for those who are interested: yes, I had a great X-mas with a lot of presents and I really enjoyed celebrating the new year in Holland. In fact, I liked it soo much that I didn&rsquo;t take the time to write about it.)</p>

<p>Back to the kings. Yesterday they arrived in Lleida (and at the very same time in a lot of other cities…) and of course we decided to have a look at them. The streets is the center were really crowded; all the children were anxious to see the guys who were going to give them lots of sweets and presents. Somehow I had to think about Paul Derks, but I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

<p>I expected to see three old guys on camels, but the reality was a little bit different. First the was the police creating room for the caravan to pass. Than came some clowns throwing confetti and cheering up all the people. Quite strange, because I cannot remember the presence of clowns in the original Bible story.</p>

<p>After that came the giants and the big-heads. These are traditional figures showing up on all the traditional events. They were accompanied by some traditional music.</p>

<p>After that, the whole festivity became to look a little bit like carnival: a lot of decorated wagons and walking groups passed, all throwing confetti or candy. I remember seeing the shepherds, the camels, the factory which processes all the requests of the children and a wonderful star. Finally the three kings arrived. Each king was preceeded by a wagon with children, and of course gad a beautiful wagon himself. The end of the parade was formed by some big trucks, carrying all the presents for the children. The whole events was good for more than 30 minutes viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>Today, we ate a special “three kings cake” as a desert. Inside the cake were a bean and a small figure of a king, and on top of the cake was a crown. The person who finds the bean has to pay the cake next year, and the person who finds the figure has to wear the crown. Luckily I found neither of them…</p>

         	<p>In Holland the weather is always the subject of the day, mainly because it is never the same as the day before. Last week, the weather has been the main topic over here as well. Not because it is changing so often (I wish it would!), but mainly because it is so bad. For the people who still think that I am in a warm sunny country: you&rsquo;re wrong!!! It is f***ing cold over here!!!</p>

<p>It came by surprise. When I was in Holland it suddenly started snowing. And because that hasn&rsquo;t happened the last decades, they are not prepared for it. Therefore it took while before they got all the material from other provinces. As a result, I was forced to spent the night in Barcelona last Sunday, because the road between Barcelona and Lleida was still blocked and it was too late to take the train. Fortunately Carme and Marta were so kind to buy already a ticket for the morning train and to pick me up. Thanks a lot!!!!!!!</p>

<p>At this moment most of the big roads are cleared, but the world is still very white. And to be honest: I am getting quite fed up with this weather. After all, one of the reasons I came here is the sun.</p>

         	<p>At this moment it is already a week ago since I was in Holland. Yes, I have been a litlle bit busy this week (indeed, I slept a lot).</p>

<p>Anyway, I can say that I really enjoyed my short visit. The wedding of Paula and John on Thursday was really great. But OK, free beer is always great, isn&rsquo;t it? It was great to see everybody again. And in such an atmosphere, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that the band made all the songs sound like René Froger.</p>

<p>Friday was another highlight, the concert of De Heideroosjes. It was a pleasant surprise that we went with 27 persons. At the busstop I found out that I was by far the oldest: The second (Jos) is 6 years younger!!! At least it shows that I am still young of heart. The body however was having some more problems. I had to go to the side a few times to get some fresh air. The concert was as I am used to.</p>

<p>Saturday and Sunday I have spend with my family (indeed, sleeping again). My room at home has really been transformed by my parents. They bought a new bed for me and removed the old computer desk. A think they want to tell me this way that MJ and I are always welcome.</p>

         	<p>After hearing a lot of times that having fog every day is not normal, and that it is only the case here in Lleida, I decided to check it out myself.</p>

<p>So last Saturday, MJ and I decided to spend one day on the beach, hoping to see some sun. We woke up early (at least for us), prepared all the stuff for a pick-nick on the beach and got into the car.</p>

<p>Although it was not as sunny as we hoped, the weather was good enough for a pick-nick. We found a nice spot on the beach to sit down and eat our sandwiches and our salad and drink some red wine. In the mean time we could enjoy the view of the sea in front of us. We were just in between Salou and Cambrils. After the pick-nick we walked to Cambrils to get a cup of coffee. Cambrils is a pictoresque little town with a lot of nice shops and restaurants. Unlike Salou, it hasn&rsquo;t got bars and discos, and as a result the atmosphere is much different.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The 6<sup>th</sup> of December is an important day: it is the birthday of &lsquo;<a href="http://www.sinterklaas.nl">Sinterklaas</a>&rsquo; (yes, I know it is Paul). Every year the old man leaves Spain to visit Holland for a few weeks and to give presents to all the Dutch children. As you can imagine, the Dutch children are very pleased with his visit.</p>

<p>But I have to warn all the Dutch parents: DO NOT TRUST THIS GUY!!!!!!! I haven&rsquo;t found out yet what is wrong with him, but it is a fact that the Spanish people are really happy because he is out of the country for some time. The party here is even bigger than in Holland: here everybody receives an official free day, only because Sinterklaas is out of the country. You can imagine how much they hate him…</p>

<p>To celebrate our free day (día del constitución), I went out with my colleagues yesterday. It is very common to visit a restaurant with your colleagues in December. Before that I visited a pub with two others. I hoped to get to know another pub, but they decided to visit <a href="http://www.scrub-australian.com">Scrub</a>. OK, it is a nice pub, so I was not complaining.</p>

<p>The supper was really good, although the others were complaining a little bit about the price. Here 4000 pesetas (Fl. 53,-) is a lot of money for a meal, but for me it is a quite normal price. Afterwards we visited some pubs. And yes, the very first one (O&rsquo;Sullivans) was the one where my sweet darling MJ and here friends happened to be… At 4 o&rsquo;clock I met here again in River Café. She came to see me, because I had the keys of the car… 😉</p>

         	<p>This weekend MJ is in Lithuania for a <a title="Fimcap" href="http://www.fimcap.org">Fimcap</a> meeting. I better say ‘was’, because she is almost back again. In a few hours I will take the car and pick her up in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Of course I could have used this weekend to have a big party (after all, the b**** is gone…), but I decided to have a quiet weekend. Of course I went to drink a beer yesterday, but most of the time I was sleeping, reading, watching television or studying Spanish. Today we also celebrated the birthday of Cristine, MJ&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>The weather here is alright. During the day it is sunny, but in the morning and after five (I had to check at the window…) there is one problem: FOG! Not a little bit, but really a lot; sometimes you can see only ten meters. That is also one of the reasons why I have decided to leave really early to Barcelona. The other reason is that I expect a lot of traffic, because this weekend the winter sport season has started. There are some places where the entrance to the pistes was free this weekend (yes, in some ways the Catalans are like Dutch).</p>

<p>By the way: did you know that Catalonia has over 300 pistes? Me neither.</p>

<p>This afternoon (after lunch, so around five o&rsquo;clock) we will go to town to do some shopping. I really like the opening times of the shops over here. In the Netherlands shops close at the moment that they open here. On the other hand, I feel sorry for the people working in the stores.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday somebody tried to phone me during the day. Unfortunately I was not home yet, so I thought that it might be handy to explain something about my working hours.</p>

<p>In the morning, usually I leave at eight o&rsquo;clock. First I go to Lleida to bring MJ and her sister Cristina to their work. Afterwards I drive to Torrefarera where my company is. I start working at nine o&rsquo;clock and finish again at half past one. Then I go to Lleida again, pick up the others and arrive home at half past two. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t have to go to Lleida; then I leave home at half past eight and arrive home again at quarter to two.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I enjoy a nice meal with the family (in Spain the lunch is the most important meal of the day), and I go back to work again at quarter past three (or twenty to four if I can go to my work directly). I work until 8 o&rsquo;clock, and usually am home again at half past eight.</p>

<p>Of course there are always exceptions. Sometimes after work we go the pub to drink something with some friends. Usually we go to <a href="http://www.scrub-australian.com">Scrub</a>. And other times I spent some time in town shopping or arranging some papers.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday MJ and I decided to visit the cinema. After a very busy week with a lot of new impressions, we felt that we had deserved it. Our choice was “The Score”.</p>

<p>We found out that we were not the only ones who have had a busy week, because the city was full of trafic, looking for a place to park. Normally in the Netherlands the Sunday evenings are quiet, but here Sunday is the day to visit the cinema. After 10 minutes circling around the cinema, we were lucky; a place for our car only 2 minutes walking!</p>

<p>Fortunately we arrived early, because only 10 minutes after we arrived the entrance of the cinema was completely full with people. In their wisdom, the designers of the cinema had decided to place the entrace to the halls, the toilets and the ticket office all in the back of the entrance hall. As a result, it was almost impossible to arrive to the ticket office and to go to the toilet before the movie.</p>

<p>When the movie started, I came to a big surprise: Marlon Brando has learned to speak Spanish really good! And he also had an operation of his throat. He sounded so different… And not only Marlon, but also all the other actors. By the way, I think that this also explains the average level of English spoken in this country: people never hear English in the cinema or on TV.</p>

<p>And yes, the movie was Ok.</p>

He told me everything about his job and about the company. After three hours of listening to Spanish, my head was at the point of exploding. No more information please!</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Spanish working hours foresee in these situations. After a nice lunch at home I was ready to listen again. Besides listening I also installed Windows 2000 on some computers.</p>

<p>At the end I have a positive feeling about it, but I really have to get used to speaking Spanish the whole day, because now I still have to concentrate too much.</p>

<p>I can tell you that it wasn&rsquo;t easy to say good-bye to Aino after working 4 years and 7 months for MultiSystems/Avalix/Aino. Yesterday morning I finished the last work. After I went to the baker to buy some pies (I hope that my former colleagues will remember at least the pies: “Jeroen? Yes, the guy from these wonderful pies…”). After cleaning my desk it was time to say good-bye. In the afternoon I arranged some practical things like the formal exit-meeting and bringing away my car. And that was it…</p>

<p>Today I have tried to live the life of a typical unemployed, but I was not able to sleep untill 3 pm. Maybe that is why I will start working again Monday.</p>

         	<p>As most of you know, I have spent a lot of my spare time doing voluntary work for Jong Nederland. <a href="http://jongnederland.nl">Jong Nederland</a> is a national youth organisation, with a local group in Harmelen.</p>

<p>Yesterday after a big fund-raising activity, the board and the animators of <a href="http://www.jnharmelen.nl/">Jong Nederland Harmelen</a> surprised me with an official good-bye. Normally leaving animators are thanked at a special evening with all the parents of our members, but since I am leaving the country next week they had to do it earlier.</p>

<p>Berry had prepared a nice document summing up the things I have done in Harmelen during the 13 years as an animator. If you know me a little bit, then you know that this list was not so long… The main point was that I have spent a lot of nights drinking a beer.
After that, he gave me the presents. The traditional present is one plate to put on the wall. I will surely take it with me Catalonia. Besides that I received a set of pens and a pin. It is the small things that I appreciate most…</p>

<p>Of course I arranged a box of beer afterwards, which reminds me of one more thing: I still have to pay my bill!</p>

         	<p>On Saturday, October 20th, my parents and my sister have organised a farewell party for all my family. They have really made a big effort of organising a great party. The best for me was that all the invited people showed up. Fortunately the weather was quite good, because we really couldn&rsquo;t fit everybody into the house.</p>

<p>MJ and I have received a lot of nice presents, mostly typical Dutch products as drop, hagelslag, erwtensoep and pepernoten. Some people also took the occasion to get rid of their last pesetas.</p>

<p>I can tell from both of us: Thanks a lot!!!!</p>

         	<p>One week of holidays is not a lot if you have to travel back and forth to the other end of Europe.</p>

<p>Last week, we have spent the whole weekend packing my stuff. The result was a huge pile of boxes, of which everybody doubted it would fit into the car. On Sunday evening we removed the couches from the car and started fitting everything in it. To our surprise, there was some space left!!! So we quickly went back inside to get three more boxes which I intended to leave in Harmelen.</p>

<p>On Monday we left at 4 o&rsquo;clock at night to drive in one time to Lleida. Expected distance: 1600 kilometers. At half past nine at night we parked the car in the garage in Alpicat. Completely exhausted we made it just before the Catalan supper time!</p>

<p>Tuesday we took a rest and emptied the car, and on Wednesday we arranged some practical things as visiting a language school, washing the car, checking the oil and arranging some of my stuff (CD&rsquo;s!!!).</p>

<p>Thursday morning we left at 4:30 in the morning, with an almost empty car. The trip went a ot faster this time, but again we were exhausted.</p>

<p>And now I am here, while all my stuff is over there. I will have to wait two more weeks before I will leave Harmelen definitivly.</p>

         	<p>Just a few more days to go! My room in Harmelen is turning little by little into a big mess. I am emptying my wardrobes, spreading everything out on the floor, putting stuff into boxes. Along the way I find back things of which I couldn&rsquo;t even remember their existence.</p>

<p>And as you can imagine I just have to read those old letters, go through the old pictures, look into the old magazines…</p>

<p>In between there is of course my daily life: getting up, going to work, meeting friends, talking with my parents and of course phoning with MJ. The days all seem so very short…</p>

<p>Anyway, four more days to go, and then everything has to be packed. I haven&rsquo;t decided yet the exact way to drive to Lleida. There are two options: drive over Paris – Toulouse – through the Pyrenees or Lyon – Perpignan. The first option is shorter, but with smaller roads and the second option has better roads, but over a longer distance.</p>

<p>After I am back, I will be working again until October 31st. On Friday November 2nd I will finally take the plane to the south of Europe.</p>

<p>But first I&rsquo;ll have to find a job and housing over there. I expect that it won&rsquo;t be a big problem.</p>

<p>Daarna ben ik anderhalve week te gast geweest bij Miriam en Joe, die ik daarvoor zeer erkentelijk ben. Daar ben ik weer helemaal tot rust gekomen. Ik heb lekker uitgerust, veel mooie, oude dingen gezien, lekker gestapt, en ook nog wat gewandeld.</p>

<p>Ik heb ondertussen weer twee fantastische weekenden gehad. Van 10 tot en met 12 september ben ik in Vlaanderen geweest voor de startdag van de Chiro. Op vrijdagavond heb ik meegeholpen met opbouwen (samen met 400! anderen), en op de dag zelf was ik gewoon deelnemer (samen met ongeveer 4000 Chiro&rsquo;s). Na afloop had Kristel nog een geweldig programma voor ons in petto: een feest van de CM in Antwerpen en op zondag een bezoek aan de meiden van Chiro Woka, waar ik me als Tipper helemaal uitgeleefd heb.</p>

<p>Afgelopen weekend was er weer eens een bureaumeeting van de Fimcap, deze keer in Zuidoostbeemster, Nederland dus. Het was een nuttige en erg gezellige bijeenkomst. Na afloop nog een aantal van mijn Europeese vrienden het &lsquo;echte&rsquo; Amsterdam laten zien, inclusief knokpartij op de wallen.</p>

<p>Ik ben nu al een paar weekenden niet meer thuis geweest. Twee weken geleden ben ik met Marco, Dagmar, Chris en Wim naar Pinkpop geweest. Vooral de twee &lsquo;rustige&rsquo; dagen vond ik erg goed. Muzikale hoogtepunten waren voor mij de Postman, de Heideroosjes, Skunk Anansi, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion en Soulfly. Het was weer eens zo&rsquo;n weekend die maar niet gezellig wilde worden&hellip;</p>

<p>Afgelopen weekend was het Jong Nederland Harmelen ouderweekend. Lekkere twee dagen lang met die oudjes spelletjes spelen! Ik moet zeggen, ze waren een stuk erger dan hun kinderen. Alle kindsheid kwam weer boven, ze waren écht een paar dagen los.</p>

<p>Hoogtepunt was uiteraard het feest op zaterdagavond: ik zie de dames nog ronddansen met verf op hun gezicht en theezakjes aan hun oren.</p>

         	<p>Hoewel ik het errug druk heb, toch nog een klein verhaaltje over afgelopen weekend.</p>

<p>Ik ben namelijk in Köln geweest om samen met mensen van KJG, Chiro en Jong Nederland te brainstormen over EuroContact 1999. EuroContact is een Europese activiteit voor jongeren van 16–18 jaar en wordt komend jaar bij Strasbourg gehouden.</p>

<p>Ik moet zeggen dat we dit weekend een hoop gedaan hebben en dat we dus volop aan de slag kunnen om er een geweldige activiteit van te maken. O ja, daarnaast hebben we natuurlijk ook gefeest.</p>

<p>Verder was er afgelopen zondag weer het volleybaltoernooi van het District Utrecht. Ook dit was weer errug gezellig; leuk om iedereen weer eens te zien. Wij van Harmelen gingen voor de (niet officiële) prijs voor het meest verbijsterende T-shirt. We hadden nieuwe T-shirts met een visje en de tekst: “Er is hoop&hellip; er is Jong Nederland Harmelen!”</p>

<p>Daarnaast hebben we tussen neus en lippen door ook nog even de worst voor de laatste plaats weggesleept.</p>

<p>&rsquo;s Ochtends vroeg hebben we met een paar man van Harmelen een verfrissend potje kwalleballen/rugby gehouden op het onder water gelopen activiteitenterrein.</p>

         	<p>Alweer twee dagen ziek thuis&hellip;</p>

<p>Ik heb (voor de vierde keer dit jaar) een ontsteking in mijn gezicht. Met andere woorden: ik zie er weer eens niet uit.</p>

<p>Vanmiddag van de huisarts (want voor de dermatoloog ben ik geen spoedgeval) medicijnen gehad waar de geplande aanval op Kosovo niets bij is.</p>

<p>Ik hoop dus dat ik er binnen een paar dagen weer vanaf ben.</p>

         	<p>Oeps, ik merk dat ik deze pagina niet echt goed bijgehouden heb. Ik had natuurlijk allang wat moeten vertellen over mijn vakantie in Lesotho enzo. Om het goed te maken het volgende:</p>

<p>Afgelopen weekend was er weer eens een echte kaderschouw. We zijn met ongeveer 20 man uit Harmelen gegaan. Op het programma stonden workshops rond intimiteiten, een informatiemarkt, veel cabaret en natuurlijk feest.</p>

<p>Ik heb nog steeds last van mijn stembanden, en voel me nog erg moe (weinig geslapen natuurlijk).</p>

         	<p>De mensen die mij de laatste tijd nog gezien hebben, hebben waarschijnlijk al gemerkt dat het niet helemaal goed met me gaat. Ik heb namelijk nogal last van een allergie.</p>

<p>Waarvoor ik allergisch ben is vooralsnog niet duidelijk, maar ik heb erg veel uitslag rond mijn ogen en op mijn armen en benen. Als gevolg van de jeuk slaap ik erg slecht &rsquo;s nachts, waardoor ik constant erg moe ben.</p>

<p>Ik hoop dat het snel weer over gaat!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Gisteravond gaf ik met Harry en Dustin een Pittig Feestje. En wat pittig is, moet geblust worden. Toen we zondag wilden opruimen, kwamen we erachter dat de brandslang de hele nacht aan had gestaan.</p>

         	<p>Vrijdagavond ben ik terug gekomen van een weekje Rome.</p>

<p>Ik moest naar Rome vanwege de FIMCAP bureaumeeting op 12 en 13 december, en als je er toch bent kun je net zo goed een weekje blijven, toch?</p>

<p>Marjolijn en ik waren niet de enige die nog wat van Rome wilden zien; Graziëlla Fallone (Ch) en Cristian Klein (Au) bleven tot maandag, Marco Simonini (I) was dinsdag nog aanwezig, Didier Urbain (Be) bleef tot en met woensdag en Susanne Sörensen en haar vriend (Dk) zijn zondag pas naar huis gegaan.</p>

<p>En wat doe je dan in zo&rsquo;n week? Gewoon: heel veel bekijken, winkelen, mensen kijken, wat rond slenteren en kletsen.</p>

<p>Niet alleen een heerlijk avondje, maar ook gezellig. En het belangrijkste natuurlijk: de kado&rsquo;s. De Sint was erg gul en gaf mij een CD-rek, een rijbewijs mapje, een boek met spelletjes, een CD-bon en een Chocoladeletter.</p>

<p>Absoluut hoogtepunt (naast het feest in de Pepsi-theek) was het zogenaamde Kleppen op zondagochtend.</p>

         	<p>De nieuws pagina is vandaag in de lucht!</p>

<p>Nieuws voor de komende tijd: 19 november promoveert Marcel Langoor aan de Universiteit van Utrecht. Sinds mijn afstuderen ben ik niet vaak meer langsgeweest op de Universiteit (shame on me!), maar de 19<sup>e</sup> ga ik weer een keer langs.</p>

<p>Verder vertrek ik op 12 december naar Rome voor de FIMCAP bureaumeeting. Waarschijnlijk blijf ik na de meeting nog een paar dagen in Rome.</p>
